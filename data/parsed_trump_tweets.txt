nielson media research final numbers on acceptance speech: trump 32.2 million. clinton 27.8 million. thank you 

can you imagine if i had the small crowds that hillary is drawing today in pennsylvania. it would be a major media event @cnn @foxnews 
nato commander agrees members should pay up via @dcexaminer:http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/nato commander agrees members should pay up/article/2598183?custom_click=rss … 
wow, nato's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must pay their bills. this is a general i will like 
the rust belt was created by politicians like the clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like mexico. end 
crooked's stop in johnstown, pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 with bill, vp 

word is that crooked hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in pennsylvania. perhaps it is because her husband signed nafta? 
i turned down a meeting with charles and david koch. much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better 
why doesn't the media want to report that on the two big thursdays when crooked hillary and i made our speeches republican's won ratings 

crooked hillary clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. a formula for disaster 
violent crime is rising across the united states, yet the dnc convention ignored it. crime reduction will be one of my top priorities. 
just got back from colorado. the love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. big crowds 


american homeownership rate in q2 2016 was 62.9% lowest rate in 51yrs. we will bring back the 'american dream 'pic.twitter.com/yi4q8fhrjp 
we are suffering through the worst long term unemployment in the last 70 years. i want change crooked hillary clinton does not. 
hillary can never win over bernie supporters. her foreign wars, nafta/tpp support & wall street ties are driving away millions of votes. 
colorado was amazing yesterday so much support. our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to colorado and the whole country. 


as usual, hillary & the dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major nfl games. same as last time w/ bernie. unacceptable 

hillary clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts. 





what bernie sanders really thinks of crooked hillary clinton.pic.twitter.com/vgmaaszbep 
i am watching crooked hillary speak. same old stuff, our country needs change 
wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more bernie supporters that they will never support crooked hillary. she sold them out, v.p. pick 

the dishonest media didn't mention that bernie sanders was very angry looking during crooked's speech. he wishes he didn't make that deal 

crooked hillary said that i couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign. really,i just beat 16 people and am beating her 

little michael bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. his last term as mayor was a disaster 

crooked hillary clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. many of her statements were lies and fabrications 

@anncoulter: i believe in science dem code for we're shutting down coal mines, steel plants and any other remaining manufacturing 

two policemen just shot in san diego, one dead. it is only getting worse. people want law and order 
crooked hillary clinton made up facts about me, and forgot to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream 
the media coverage this morning of the very average clinton speech and convention is a joke. @cnn and the little watched @morning_joe = sad 
no one has worse judgement than hillary clinton corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes. 
hillary's wars in the middle east have unleashed destruction, terrorism and isis across the world. 
hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety. 
hillary will never reform wall street. she is owned by wall street 
our way of life is under threat by radical islam and hillary clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words. 
hillary's refusal to mention radical islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country. 




median household income is down for the middle class since obama took office. it will only go further down under clinton. 
a vote for clinton kaine is a vote for tpp, nafta, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees. 




@trumplican2016: @realdonaldtrump @davidwohl stay the course mr trump your message is resonating with the people 

our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair. 
shooting deaths of police officers up 78% this year. we must restore law and order and protect our great law enforcement officers 






if russia or any other country or person has hillary clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the fbi 

not one american flag on the massive stage at the democratic national convention until people started complaining then a small one. pathetic 
our not very bright vice president, joe biden, just stated that i wanted to carpet bomb the enemy. sorry joe, that was ted cruz 
crooked hillary clinton wants to flood our country with syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. the danger is massive. no 
hopefully the violent and vicious killing by isis of a beloved french priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. get tough 
the democratic convention has paid zero respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. no recognition sad 
funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing dems narrative that russia is working for me because putin said trump is a genius. america 1st 
as i have been saying, crooked hillary will approve the job killing tpp after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv. 
just like i have warned from the beginning, crooked hillary clinton will betray you on the tpp.http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/terry mcauliffe hillary clinton tpp trade 226253 … 
many of bernie's supporters have left the arena. did bernie go home and go to sleep? 
i hate to say it, but the republican convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the democratic convention 
no matter what bill clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. highly overrated 
you have no idea what my strategy on isis is, and neither does isis (a good thing). please get your facts straight thanks. @megynkelly 
for the record, i have zero investments in russia. 
in order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the wikileakes disaster, the dems said maybe it is russia dealing with trump. crazy 

dems don't want to talk isis b/c hillary's foreign interventions unleashed isis & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here. 
bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed 
the invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for crooked hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar 



pocahontas bombed last night sad to watch. 
why aren't the democrats speaking about isis, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. the republican convention was great 
funny, if you listen to @foxnews, the democrats did not have a good day. if you listen to the other two, they are fawning. what a difference 
bernie sanders totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton. all of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it waste of time. 
elizabeth warren, often referred to as pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about crooked hillary, who she always hated 
sad to watch bernie sanders abandon his revolution. we welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs. 
if cory booker is the future of the democratic party, they have no future i know more about cory than he knows about himself. 
i was at @foxnews and met juan williams in passing. he asked if he could have pictures taken with me. i said fine. he then trashes on air 
hard to believe that bernie sanders has done such a complete fold. he got nothing for all of the time, energy and money. the v.p. a joke 
while bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers. 
clinton betrayed bernie voters. kaine supports tpp, is in pocket of wall street, and backed iraq war. 





the state of florida is so embarrassed by the antics of crooked hillary clinton and debbie wasserman schultz that they will vote for change 
wow, the republican convention went so smoothly compared to the dems total mess. but fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn 
here we go again with another clinton scandal, and e mails yet (can you believe). crooked hillary knew the fix was in, b never had a chance 
crooked hillary clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the dnc they just got caught, that's all they laughed at bernie. 
if bernie sanders, after seeing the just released e mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same. 

hillary was involved in the e mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened 
how much bad judgement was on display by the people in dnc in writing those really dumb e mails, using even religion, against bernie 
the new joke in town is that russia leaked the disastrous dnc e mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because putin likes me 
watched crooked hillary clinton and tim kaine on 60 minutes. no way they are going to fix america's problems. isis & all others laughing 
the ratings for the republican national convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. thank you 
the highly neurotic debbie wasserman schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a crooked hillary victory, she's out 
the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing e mails say the rigged system is alive & well 
even though bernie sanders has lost his energy and his strength, i don't believe that his supporters will let crooked hillary off the hook 
crooked hillary clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, dws. too bad bernie flamed out 
if the republican convention had blown up with e mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (bernie), media would go wild 
the @cnn panels are so one sided, almost all against trump. @foxnews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. don't watch cnn 
i always said that debbie wasserman schultz was overrated. the dems convention is cracking up and bernie is exhausted, no energy left 
today proves what i have always known, that @reince priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not debbie wasserman shultz (@dwstweets.) 
sorry folks, but bernie sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. he is trying to dismiss the new e mails and dnc disrespect. sad 
there is no longer a bernie sanders political revolution. he is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end 
an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates. 
looks like the bernie people will fight. if not, their blood, sweat and tears was a total waste of time. kaine stands for opposite 
wow, president obama's brother, malik, just announced that he is voting for me. was probably treated badly by president like everybody else 
bernie sanders started off strong, but with the selection of kaine for v.p., is ending really weak. so much for a movement total disrespect 
the crooked hillary v.p. choice is very disrespectful to bernie sanders and all of his supporters. just another case of bad judgement by h 

@nancynielsenn: @realdonaldtrump dinesh d'sousa hillary's america. see it 

thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on thursday night. from the heart 
the wikileaks e mail release today was so bad to sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud 
just saw crooked hillary and tim kaine together. isis and our other enemies are drooling. they don't look presidential to me 
i will bring jobs back and get wages up. people haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. clinton killed jobs 
tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. job killer 
funny that the democrats would have their convention in pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. i will bring jobs back 
crooked hillary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pennsylvania. against steelworkers and miners. husband signed nafta. 
leaked e mails of dnc show plans to destroy bernie sanders. mock his heritage and much more. on line from wikileakes, really vicious. rigged 
pocahontas wanted v.p. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the senate. also, crooked hillary hates her 
tim kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. bernie fought for nothing 
the bernie sanders supporters are furious with the choice of tim kaine, who represents the opposite of what bernie stands for. philly fight? 

i highly recommend the just out book the field of fight by general michael flynn. how to defeat radical islam. 
is it the same kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while governor of virginia and didn't get indicted while bob m did? 
another attack, this time in germany. many killed. god bless the people of munich. 
one of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions. great unity big t.v. ratings @karlrove 
thank you cleveland. we love you and will be back many times 
what a great four days in cleveland. so proud of the great job done by the rnc and all. the police and secret service were fantastic 





other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is very united. great love in the arena 
ted cruz talks about the constitution but doesn't say that if the dems win the presidency, the new justices appointed will destroy us all 
i am soooo proud of my children, don, eric and tiffany their speeches, under enormous pressure, were incredible. ivanka intros me tonight 


arena was packed, totally electric 
.@mike_pence was fantastic tonight. will be a great v.p. 

wow, ted cruz got booed off the stage, didn't honor the pledge i saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. no big deal 


thank you to governor @scottwalker for such warm support. great speech 



john kasich was never asked by me to be v.p. just arrived in cleveland will be a great two days 

the media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of melania's speech than the fbi spent on hillary's emails. 
good news is melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press 
in november, i think the people of ohio will remember that the republicans picked cleveland instead of going to another state. jobs 
bill hemmer of @foxnews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. more than in past years. 
congratulations to my children, don and tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. i am very proud of you 
such a great honor to be the republican nominee for president of the united states. i will work hard and never let you down america first 
the roll call is beginning at the republican national convention. very exciting 


@roxanetancredi: democrats are coming to trump. i used to be proud of the dem party. no more it is crooked and not for the people. 



networks other than low ratings @cnn have been very fair and exciting 
.@cnn is the worst.they go to their dumb, one sided panels when a podium speaker is for trump vast majority want: make america great again 
looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife, melania. place looks beautiful 

president obama just had a news conference, but he doesn't have a clue. our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse 
our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. we are not looking good, we are not looking smart, we are not looking tough 

i will be on @60minutes tonight at 7:00 p.m. with mike pence talking about law and order and many other subjects bad times for divided usa 
we are trying to fight isis, and now our own people are killing our police. our country is divided and out of control. the world is watching 

the ratings at @foxnews blow away the ratings of @cnn not even close. that's because cnn is the clinton news network and people don't like 
.@foxnews is much better, and far more truthful, than @cnn, which is all negative. guests are stacked for crooked hillary i don't watch. 
if goofy elizabeth warren, a very weak senator, didn't lie about her heritage (being native american) she would be nothing today. pick her h 
i hope that crooked hillary picks goofy elizabeth warren, sometimes referred to as pocahontas, as her v.p. then we can litigate her fraud 
it doesn't matter that crooked hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. bernie said she has bad judgement 
as the days and weeks go by, we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in crooked hillary clinton led obama into bad decisions 
we are going to have a great time in cleveland. will lead to special results for our country. we will make america great again 
goofy elizabeth warren, who may be the least productive senator in the u.s. senate, must prove she is not a fraud. without the con it's over 
thank you to jack morgan, tamara neo, cheryl ann kraft and all of my friends and supporters in virginia. great job 

thank you to chris cox and bikers for trump your support has been amazing. i will never forget. make america great again 

crooked hillary clinton is bought and paid for by wall street, lobbyists and special interests. she will sell our country down the tubes 
very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, crooked hillary clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money 
crooked hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e mail lies, has been a disaster on foreign policy. look what's happening 
crooked hillary is spending big wall street money on ads saying i don't have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have done 
look forward to introducing governor mike pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great state of indiana). my first choice from start 
look forward to governor mike pence v.p. introduction tomorrow in new york city. 
i am pleased to announce that i have chosen governor mike pence as my vice presidential running mate. news conference tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. 
four more years of weakness with a crooked hillary administration is not acceptable. look what has happened to the world with o & hillary 

my prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in nice, france. we are with you in every way 
in light of the horrible attack in nice, france, i have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my vice presidential announcement. 
another horrific attack, this time in nice, france. many dead and injured. when will we learn? it is only getting worse. 
i employ many people in the state of virginia jobs, jobs, jobs crooked hillary will sell us out, just like her husband did with nafta. 


i will be making the announcement of my vice presidential pick on friday at 11am in manhattan. details to follow. 
if i win the presidency, we will swamp justice ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions 
even the @nytimes and @washingtonpost editorial boards condemned justice ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. what was she thinking? 
is supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? big mistake by an incompetent judge 
on my way to san diego to raise money for the republican party. i am spending a lot myself and also helping others. 
voters understand that crooked hillary's negative ads are not true just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity. 

lyin' crooked hillary's email stories all have one thing in common.pic.twitter.com/teovcyxkor 
is president obama trying to destroy israel with all his bad moves? think about it and let me know 
the republican platform is most pro israel of all time 
new gop platform now includes language that supports the border wall. we will build the wall and make america safe again 



justice ginsburg of the u.s. supreme court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. her mind is shot resign 


i will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @foxnews at 8pm. enjoy 

to all the bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests, we welcome you with open arms. people first. 
bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro war pro tpp pro wall street crooked hillary clinton. 
bernie sanders endorsing crooked hillary clinton is like occupy wall street endorsing goldman sachs. 

i am somewhat surprised that bernie sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. they are not happy that he is selling out 
bernie sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton. he will endorse her today fans angry 

for too many years, our inner cities have been left behind. i am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need. 
crime is out of control, and rapidly getting worse. look what is going on in chicago and our inner cities. not good 

senior united states district judge robert e. payne today ruled in favor of trump campaign delegates who had argued..https://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/posts/10157294436575725 … 


thoughts and prayers with the victims, and their families along with everyone at the berrien county courthouse in st. joseph, michigan. 

i heard that the underachieving john king of @cnn on inside politics was one hour of lies. happily, few people are watching dead network 
the media is so dishonest. if i make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.they think the public is stupid 
president obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. he is living in a world of the make believe 
look what is happening to our country under the weak leadership of obama and people like crooked hillary clinton. we are a divided nation 

way to go @serenawilliams you are a true champion. proud of you 

isn't it sad that on a day of national tragedy hillary clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on @cnn? 
due to the horrific events taking place in our country, i have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity today in miami. 
last night's horrific execution style shootings of 12 dallas law enforcement officers...https://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/posts/10157277205810725 … 
prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country 
after today, crooked hillary can officially be called lyin' crooked hillary. 



just leaving d.c. had great meetings with republicans in the house and senate. very interesting day these are people who love our country 



convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. let today be devoted to crooked hillary and the rigged system under which we live. 
i have over seven million hits on social media re crooked hillary clinton. check it out sleepy eyes, @markhalperin @nbcpolitics 
sleepy eyes chuck todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.he could not have watched my standing ovation speech in n.c. 
even the once great caesars is bankrupt in a.c. others to follow. ask the democrat city council what happened to atlantic city. 
hillary clinton should ask why the democrat pols in atlantic city made all the wrong moves convention center, airport and destroyed city 
i made a lot of money in atlantic city and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies. 
crooked hillary clinton lied to the fbi and to the people of our country. she is sooooo guilty. but watch, her time will come 
the rigged system may have helped hillary clinton escape criminal charges, but...https://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/videos/10157263351880725/ …pic.twitter.com/8cbsfnpl2l 
crooked hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement. 
crooked hillary clinton and her team were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. not fit 
crooked hillary clinton is unfit to serve as president of the u.s. her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. bad judgement 
i don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed crooked hillary to get away with murder. come november 8, she's out 
raised a lot of money for the republican party. there will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. lots of support win 
i will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @foxnews at 11pm. enjoy 
my son, @erictrump will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10pm on @foxnews. enjoy 
looking forward to meeting with @senbobcorker in a little while. we will be traveling to north carolina together today. 

the system is rigged. general petraeus got in trouble for far less. very very unfair as usual, bad judgment. 
it was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. she has done a fantastic job for the people of iowa and u.s. will see her again 
taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of air force one on the campaign trail by president obama and crooked hillary. a total disgrace 
on @foxnews at 7:00 p.m. special: meet the trumps hope you enjoy 
why is president obama allowed to use air force one on the campaign trail with crooked hillary? she is flying with him tomorrow. who pays? 
with hillary and obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is radical islam 
crooked hillary clinton is guilty as hell but the system is totally rigged and corrupt where are the 33,000 missing e mails? 
the only people who are not interested in being the v.p. pick are the people who have not been asked 
i look forward to meeting @joniernst today in new jersey. she has done a great job as senator of iowa 
spent time with indiana governor mike pence and family yesterday. very impressed, great people 
senator tom cotton was great on meet the press yesterday. despite a totally one sided interview by chuck todd, the end result was solid 
dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the star of david rather than a sheriff's star, or plain star 

crooked hillary will never be able to handle the complexities and danger of isis it will just go on forever. we need change 
the third mass attack (slaughter) in days by isis. 200 dead in baghdad, worst in many years. we do not have leadership that can stop this 
in bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by isis terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the koran. 20 were killed 
i believe that crooked hillary sent bill to have the meeting with the u.s.a.g. so bill is not in trouble with h except that he got caught 
the secret meeting between bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. in back of closed plane was heightened with fbi shouting go away, no pictures. 
does anybody really believe that bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. talked only about grandkids and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac? 
the system is rigged 
on saturday a great man, elie wiesel, passed away.the world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil 
crooked hillary clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the u.s.a.g. to work out a deal. the system is totally rigged & corrupt 
only a fool would believe that the meeting between bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. was not arranged or that crooked hillary did not know. 
just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me chuck todd, and the entire show, is against me.the good news the people get it 
it was just announced by sources that no charges will be brought against crooked hillary clinton. like i said, the system is totally rigged 
it is impossible for the fbi not to recommend criminal charges against hillary clinton. what she did was wrong what bill did was stupid 







the speakers slots at the republican convention are totally filled, with a long waiting list of those that want to speak wednesday release 
just read in the failing @nytimes that i was not aware the event had to be held in cleveland a total lie. these people are sick 

just returned from colorado. amazing crowd 





.@traceadkins great job on fox this morning. keep up the good work 
take a look at what happened w/ bill clinton. the system is totally rigged. does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence? 
bill clinton's meeting was a total secret. nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter. 
as bernie sanders said, hillary clinton has bad judgement. bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by hillary 

i will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10pm on fox enjoy 
the reason i put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, i want to make america great again 
i have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. i have totally terminated the loan 
the very dishonest @nbcnews refuses to accept the fact that i have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. done deal 



the story with hillary will never change.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the fix/wp/2016/06/28/hillary clintons email story continues to get harder and harder to believe/ … 
for reasons only they can explain, the @uschamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better. 
tremendous day in massachusetts and maine. thank you to everyone for making it so special 
@gengm7: @jakeda @realdonaldtrump as of april this year, hillary had spent $264,000,000 on her campaign mr.trump $55,000,000. self funding 
i will be on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 p.m. enjoy 
isis exploded on hillary clinton's watch she's done nothing about it and never will. not capable 


just watched senator john barrasso on @foxnews he was great thank you john. 
why would the uschamber be upset by the fact that i want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that i want penalties for cheaters? 
the @uschamber must fight harder for the american worker. china, and many others, are taking advantage of u.s. with our terrible trade pacts 
iron mike tyson was not asked to speak at the convention though i'm sure he would do a good job if he was. the media makes everything up 
@jtsbk: @allenwest thanks for sharing eric we need @realdonaldtrump now as this administration is incapable of keeping our country safe 
we must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the united states. 
yet another terrorist attack, this time in turkey. will the world ever realize what is going on? so sad. 
hillary clinton’s presidency would be catastrophic for the future of our country. she is ill fit with bad judgment. 
benghazi is just another hillary clinton failure. it just never seems to work the way it's supposed to with clinton. 

@kridan1: canceled cable sick of their bad coverage of you and the fawning over clinton ... listened to your great speech on youtube 


@patricia_graf: @govbrewer @cvpayne let's get trump supporters out in massive numbers and make america great again create jobs 

@govbrewer: i'll be a guest today on making money with @cvpayne on @ fox business 6 pm et / 3 pm pt discussing @realdonaldtrump. tune in 
.@cnn is all negative when it comes to me. i don't watch it anymore. 
the media is unrelenting. they will only go with and report a story in a negative light. i called brexit (hillary was wrong), watch november 
crooked hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the u.s. senate, goofy elizabeth warren, who lied on heritage. 




the dirty poll done by @abc @washingtonpost is a disgrace. even they admit that many more democrats were polled. other polls were good. 

crooked hillary clinton got brexit wrong. i said leave will win. she has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. only a question of time 
hillary clinton is not a change agent, just the same old status quo she is spending a fortune, i am spending very little. close in polls 
people in our country want borders, and without them the old line pols like crooked hillary will not win. it is time for change and jobs 

the @abc poll sample is heavy on democrats. very dishonest why would they do that? other polls good 
crooked hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at turnberry. shows me hitting shot, but i never did = lie was there to support son 
clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on brexit with big dollar ads. disgraceful 
crooked hillary clinton, who called brexit 100% wrong (along with obama), is now spending wall street money on an ad on my correct call. 
george will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the republican party.he's made many bad calls 
just landed in new york a one night stay in scotland. turnberry came out magnificently. my son, eric, did a great job under budget 
obama has blocked ice officers and bp from doing their jobs. that ends when i am president 
i have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' but we must enforce the laws of the land 

we must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place. 
thank you to everyone who came out & joined us @trumpturnberry yesterday @erictrump @ivankatrump @donaldjtrumpjrpic.twitter.com/hq1jtmrutg 


so funny, crooked hillary called brexit so incorrectly, and now she says that she is the one to deal with the u.k. all talk, no action 

@jolena3: @realdonaldtrump and we will get it back once we have president trump can't wait 
@darrenwaggener: @realdonaldtrump what has happened in the uk in the last 12 hours is exactly what will happen in november..vote trump 2016 
many people are equating brexit, and what is going on in great britain, with what is happening in the u.s. people want their country back 
the opening of trump turnberry in scotland was a big success. good timing, i was here for brexit. very exciting news conference today 
crooked hillary called it totally wrong on brexit she went with obama and now she is saying we need her to lead. she would be a disaster 
i want all americans to succeed together. president obama's illegal executive amnesty undermines job prospects for...https://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/posts/10157210293405725 … 
new government data by the center for immigration studies shows more than 3m new legal & illegal immigrants settled..https://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/posts/10157214830260725 … 
america is proud to stand shoulder to shoulder w/a free & ind uk. we stand together as friends, as allies, & as a people w/a shared history. 
self determination is the sacred right of all free people's, and the people of the uk have exercised that right for all the world to see. 
getting ready to open the magnificent turnberry in scotland. what a great day, especially when added to the brave & brilliant vote. 

just arrived in scotland. place is going wild over the vote. they took their country back, just like we will take america back. no games 
congratulations to my son, eric, on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding turnberry, and its great ailsa course. always support kids 
leaving now for a one night trip to scotland in order to be at the grand opening of my great turnberry resort. will be back on sat. night 
meet the amazing mother whose letter i read during my speech. she lost her son to policies supported by clinton.http://www.breitbart.com/2016 presidential race/2016/06/22/momsaysclintonscampaignspewshate/ … 

here is another cnn lie. the clinton news network is losing all credibility. i’m not watching it much anymore.http://www.breitbart.com/big journalism/2016/06/23/cnns clinton cash fact check ends embarrassment cristina alesci laurie frankel/ … 
cnn, which is totally biased in favor of clinton, should apologize. they knew they were wrong.http://www.breitbart.com/2016 presidential race/2016/06/23/cnns tom foreman caught lying in trump refugees fact check/ … 
our inner cities have been left behind. we will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border. 
on immigration, i’m consulting with our immigration officers & our wage earners. hillary clinton is consulting with wall street. 
obama & clinton should stop meeting with special interests, & start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration. 

sc has kept us safe from exec amnesty for now. but hillary has pledged to expand it, taking jobs from hispanic & african american workers. 

isis threatens us today because of the decisions hillary clinton has made along with president obama. donald j. trump 
hillary clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. donald j. trump 
thank you to donald rumsfeld for the endorsement. very much appreciated. clinton's conduct has been disqualifying. 
@allegrettivicki: you have great children, future presidents...and we all see were raised right and out there for their father. thank you. 

@justininglv: @realdonaldtrump great speech today it's all about america and that's why you will become president thank you. 



@chrisboydbrew: @loudobbs @realdonaldtrump @foxbusiness.. saw your interview.you are the best great questions, great answers lou is great 
crooked hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief she will be a disaster for jobs and the economy 
i will be interviewed by @loudobbs tonight on @foxbusiness 7pm et 
hillary defrauded america as secy of state. she used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich corrupt, dangerous, dishonest. 
if you want to know about hillary clinton's honesty & judgment, ask the family of ambassador stevens. 
hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays. 
i am the king of debt. that has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. i made a fortune off of debt, will fix u.s. 

hillary clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all americans and make everyone less safe. 
how can hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk? 
hillary clinton surged the trade deficit with china 40% as secretary of state, costing americans millions of jobs. 
hillary says this election is about judgment. she's right. her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed isis and wrecked the economy. 
i will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of crooked hillary clinton. 
crooked hillary clinton is totally unfit to be our president really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess 
when i said that if, within the orlando club, you had some people with guns, i was obviously talking about additional guards or employees 
.@djohnsonpga we are so proud of you dustin. your reaction under pressure was amazing. first of many majors. you are a true champion 


how can the ny times show an empty room hours before my speech even started when they knew it was going to be packed? so totally dishonest 





in las vegas, getting ready to speak 








make america great again make america safe again 
people very unhappy with crooked hillary and obama on jobs and safety biggest trade deficit in many years more attacks will follow orlando 
amazing crowd last night in dallas more spirit and passion than ever before. today, all over the great state of texas 







@realericjallen: @realdonaldtrump is a common sense conservative president trump=competence, safety, unity, & us jobs, jobs, job. 
i will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 p.m. @foxnews 



i will be meeting with the nra, who has endorsed me, about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no fly list, to buy guns. 
the press is so totally biased that we have no choice but to take our tough but fair and smart message directly to the people 
an: media fell all over themselves criticizing what donaldtrump may have insinuated about @potus. but he's right:http://bit.ly/1tpaflm  



thank you to the lgbt community i will fight for you while hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs. 
america first 
american must now get very tough, very smart and very vigilant. we cannot admit people into our country without extraordinary screening. 



i thought people weren’t celebrating? they were cheering all over, even this savage from orlando. i was right.http://nypost.com/2016/06/13/orlando killer cheered 911 attacks former classmates say/ … 
in my speech on protecting america i spoke about a temporary ban, which includes suspending immigration from nations tied to islamic terror. 




i am watching @foxnews and how fairly they are treating me and my words, and @cnn, and the total distortion of my words and what i am saying 
i will be going to new hampshire today, home of my first primary victory, to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday. 2:30 p.m. 
i have been hitting obama and crooked hillary hard on not using the term radical islamic terror. hillary just broke said she would now use 
what has happened in orlando is just the beginning. our leadership is weak and ineffective. i called it and asked for the ban. must be tough 
@wandawalls20: @realdonaldtrump please make us safe. we cannot have hillary as president. we will be in so much trouble. 
reporting that orlando killer shouted allah hu akbar as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in la with rifles near gay parade. 
is president obama going to finally mention the words radical islamic terrorism? if he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace 
appreciate the congrats for being right on radical islamic terrorism, i don't want congrats, i want toughness & vigilance. we must be smart 
horrific incident in fl. praying for all the victims & their families. when will this stop? when will we get tough, smart & vigilant? 
clinton made a false ad about me where i was imitating a reporter groveling after he changed his story. i would never mock disabled. shame 
really bad shooting in orlando. police investigating possible terrorism. many people dead and wounded. 
goofy elizabeth warren, sometimes referred to as pocahontas, pretended to be a native american in order to advance her career. very racist 
riley rone was a great young man. we will miss him dearly.pic.twitter.com/r0tm44nmao 




sad case @usatoday did article saying i don't pay bills false, only don't pay when work is shoddy, bad, or not done they should do same 

don king, and so many other african americans who know me well and endorsed me, would not have done so if they thought i was a racist 
mitt romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. now he calls me racist but i am least racist person there is 






heading to d.c. to speak at faith and freedom coalition and visit opo. 

the great boxing promoter, don king, just endorsed me. nice 



pocahontas is at it again goofy elizabeth warren, one of the least productive u.s. senators, has a nasty mouth. hope she is v.p. choice. 


thank you roseanne, very much appreciated.http://thehill.com/blogs/blog briefing room/news/282864 roseanne barr we would be so lucky if trump won … 
how long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up and where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted?https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/740973710593654784 … 

obama just endorsed crooked hillary. he wants four more years of obama—but nobody else does 
crooked hillary clinton will be a disaster on jobs, the economy, trade, healthcare, the military, guns and just about all else. obama plus 
as expected, the media is very much against me. their dishonesty is amazing but, just like our big wins in the primaries, we will win 
@kathyceurter: @realdonaldtrump please mr.trump make @senatorjeffsessions your vp. he is a perfect running mate. he is a great guy 
bernie sanders must really dislike crooked hillary after the way she played him. many of his supporters, because of trade, will come to me. 
@mabynshingleton: johnkasich, the voters have spoken.we want @realdonaldtrump. you agreed to support nominee. get on board or leave @gop 
@dale_dangler: @realdonaldtrump you will be the greatest president the world has ever seen thanks. 
i would have had many millions of votes more than crooked hillary clinton except for the fact that i had 16 opponents, she had one 
@nauthizjane: @realdonaldtrump congratulations mr. trump. thank you 
@setfire2flames: senator sanders spent more than @realdonaldtrump yet lost. 

@lovusa4: @richardweaving why @foxandfriends @newday where is the reporting @realdonaldtrump <most votes for president in history of usa 
@mariadaq: historic what's historic is our national debt, record unemployment, &pocketbook crisis the people need trump2 make usa rich 
@sara_wejesa: @realdonaldtrump great speach thanks 
@jimhewitt: . @frankcaliendo doing @realdonaldtrump on @mikeandmike is awesome. number one presidency of all time 
@joedefranco: top rino hack for msnbc joey scarborough on the air and calling the next president trump a racist and bigot. shame on you 
nobody is watching @morning_joe anymore. gone off the deep end bad ratings. you won't believe what i am watching now 
@southpaw816: @sensanders fans, greatest way to get even with her highness vote for @realdonaldtrump, at least you'll have a job. 
thank you to all for your wonderful comments on my speech. i could feel the electricity in thr air. great reviews most votes ever recieved 







i will be speaking about our great journey to the republican nomination at 9:00 p.m. the movement toward a country that wins again continues 
i will be interviewed tonight on @seanhannity enjoy 10:00 p.m. 

in just out book, secret service agent gary byrne doesn't believe that crooked hillary has the temperament or integrity to be the president 
a former secret service agent for president clinton excoriates crooked hillary describing her as erratic & violent. bad temperament for pres 
see, when i said nato was obsolete because of no terrorism protection, they made the change without giving me credit.http://www.wsj.com/articles/nato considers new intelligence chief post 1464968453 … 


i am getting bad marks from certain pundits because i have a small campaign staff. but small is good, flexible, save money and number one 
a massive blow to obama's message only 38,000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. that's really bad 
crooked hillary is being badly criticized (for a wall street paid for ad) by politifact for a false ad on me on women. she is a total fraud 
crooked hillary clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions 

people like @katyturnbc report on my campaign, but have zero access. they say what they want without any knowledge.true of so much of media 
hillary clinton is unfit to be president. she has bad judgement, poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. change 
i am watching @cnn very little lately because they are so biased against me. shows are predictable garbage cnn and msm is one big lie 
the clinton news network, sometimes referred to as @cnn, is getting more and more biased.they act so indignant hear them behind closed doors 

thank you attorney general gonzales, so many people feel this way.http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot box/presidential races/282222 former bush ag trump right to challenge judges fairness … 
we just had the worst jobs report since 2010. 
the mayor of san jose did a terrible job of ordering the protection of innocent people. the thugs were lucky supporters remained peaceful 
many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful trump supporters in san jose were illegals. they burned the american flag and laughed at police 


muhammad ali is dead at 74 a truly great champion and a wonderful guy. he will be missed by all 

great evening in san jose other than the thugs. my supporters are far tougher if they want to be, but fortunately they are not hostile. 
so much interest in my visit to scotland i greatly look forward to attending the opening event @trumpturnberry taking place on june 24th. 

in crooked hillary's telepromter speech yesterday, she made up things that i said or believe but have no basis in fact. not honest 
i don't watch or do @morning_joe anymore. small audience, low ratings i hear mika has gone wild with hate. joe is joe. they lost their way 
rally last night in san jose was great. tremendous love and enthusiasm in the hall. big crowd. outside, small group of thugs burned am flag 
terrible jobs report just reported. only 38,000 jobs added. bombshell 

@liliannyleebou: i think the first female president of the usa will be @ivankatrump a beautiful intelligent young genuine successful lady 


@crz4basball: @judgejeanine @realdonaldtrump looks like several legal hispanics supporting trump they know he will be good for them too. 
then, on june 25th back to the usa to make america great again 
after @trumpscotland, i will visit @trumpdoonbeg in ireland, the magnificent resort fronting on the atlantic ocean. 
after @trumpturnberry i will be visiting aberdeen, the oil capital of europe, to see my great club, @trumpscotland. 
on june 22 i will be going to scotland to celebrate the opening of the newly renovated @trumpturnberry resort, the worlds best. 


@robertmordica: @realdonaldtrump only trump can save america. right leader at the right time. thank you 
@valenti317: @realdonaldtrump she's a criminal and you're the only person that can stop her. 

@free_sa_bd: @realdonaldtrump a vote for trump is a vote to restore our great country. 
a 60% increase in texas blue cross/blue shield through obamacare. i told you so, there is panic and anger as healthcare costs explode 
so great to have the endorsement and support of paul ryan. we will both be working very hard to make america great again 
bad performance by crooked hillary clinton reading poorly from the telepromter she doesn't even look presidential 
crooked hillary no longer has credibility too much failure in office. people will not allow another four years of incompetence 
crooked hillary clinton, who i would love to call lyin' hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions. 
after the litigation is disposed of and the case won, i have instructed my execs to open trump u(?), so much interest in it i will be pres. 
even though i have a very biased and unfair judge in the trump u civil case in san diego, i have thousands of great reviews & will win case 
with all of the crooked hillary clinton's foreign policy experience, she has made so many mistakes and i mean real monsters no more hrc. 

wow, usa today did todays cover story on my record in lawsuits. verdict: 450 wins, 38 losses. isn't that what you want for your president? 
do you ever notice that @cnn gives me very little proper representation on my policies. just watched nobody knew anything about my foreign p 
bernie sanders was right when he said that crooked hillary clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from bad judgement 
crooked hillary clinton has zero natural talent she should not be president. her temperament is bad and her decision making ability zilch 

@scpioneer: @stockdaleism @jamesrosenfnc @foxnews @realdonaldtrump not for slackers happy w/courses i took. thanks. 

same failing @nytimes reporter who wrote discredited women's story last week wrote another terrible story on me today will never learn 
crooked hillary clinton is a fraud who has put the public and country at risk by her illegal and very stupid use of e mails. many missing 

so i raised/gave $5,600,000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad they do anything to belittle totally biased. 
congratulations to @seanhannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings. speaking of ratings i will be on his show tonight @ 10pe. 
i am getting great credit for my press conference today. crooked hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days. 
katie couric, the third rate reporter, who has been largely forgotten, should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc. 
i will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10pme on @foxnews. enjoy 

so many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money i raised/gave it was my great honor they do an amazing job. 
just finished a press conference in trump tower wherein i gave information on which veterans groups got the $5,600,000 that i raised/gave 
i have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great veterans, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. watch 
so many great things happening new poll numbers looking good news conference at 11:00 a.m. today, trump tower 
i should have easily won the trump university case on summary judgement but have a judge, gonzalo curiel, who is totally biased against me. 
i have a judge in the trump university civil case, gonzalo curiel (san diego), who is very unfair. an obama pick. totally biased hates trump 
i hope everyone had a great memorial day 
i would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than crooked hillary) if i only had one opponent, instead of sixteen. broke record 
have a great memorial day and remember that we will soon make america great again 

@frankylamouche: how many of donald's rolling thunder brigade will sign up and go to war for him in the middle east. 



the endorsement of me by the 16,500 border patrol agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. nice 
in getting the endorsement of the 16,500 border patrol agents (thank you), the statement was made that the wall was very necessary 
obama says a wall at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at w.h. 
if dummy bill kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an independent, say good bye to the supreme court 
the republican party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in november. can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler indie candidate 
bill kristol has been wrong for 2yrs an embarrassed loser, but if the gop can't control their own, then they are not a party. be tough, r's 
good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics b/c i stand 100% behind everything we do. 
heading to d.c. to see and hear rolling thunder. amazing people that love our country. great spirit 
honor memorial day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country we love them. 

don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. the only quote that matters is a quote from me 
i am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes, but when i won the gop nomination, i'm in the back of the paper. very dishonest 
the media is on a new phony kick about my management style. i spend much less money & get much better results what we need as prez 
the failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style & that i don't have many people. i have 73, hillary has 800 & i'm beating her. 
i (we) broke the all time record for most votes gotten in a republican primary by a lot and with many states left to go thank you. 
the u.s. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. how nice, but what do we get? not enough

thank you @billyjoel many friends just told me you gave a very kind shoutout at msg. appreciate it love your music 

i am on @oreillyfactor tonight, a big special. @foxnews at 8:00 p.m. enjoy 


poll data shows that @marcorubio does by far the best in holding onto his senate seat in florida. important to keep the majority. run marco 




i find it offensive that goofy elizabeth warren, sometimes referred to as pocahontas, pretended to be native american to get in harvard. 

.@kimguilfoyle just watched you on @outnumberedfnc thank you 
the inspector general's report on crooked hillary clinton is a disaster. such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the w.h. 

thank you washington honored to say, on behalf of our great movement, we have broken the all time record for votes in gop primary history. 
the protesters in new mexico were thugs who were flying the mexican flag. the rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals 
crooked hillary clinton just can't close the deal with bernie. i had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. hillary doesn't have it 
goofy senator elizabeth warren @elizabethforma has done less in the u.s. senate than practically any other senator. all talk, no action 
@elizabethforma goofy elizabeth warren, sometimes known as pocahontas, bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing. total hypocrite 
@gordonsr1052: washington, big thank you for supporting trump we are all going to help trump make america great again trump2016 
@buiidthewall: @realdonaldtrump high energy 
@pipersul: great speech tonight mr.trump good luck in california thank you. 
@deepaks76435750: @realdonaldtrump congratulations from india 


@tcloer11: @realdonaldtrump great job make america great again 
@elizabethforma goofy elizabeth warren, sometimes referred to as pocahontas because she faked the fact she is native american, is a lowlife 
great rally in new mexico, amazing crowd now in l.a. big rally in anaheim. 


after raising, w/ no obligation, almost $6m for vets, i couldn't believe protesters formed @ trump tower. just out sent by crooked hillary 


a wonderfully written article concerning israel by @jasondovesqhttp://blogs.timesofisrael.com/a trump presidency means a safer israel/ … 
a great new book has been written about crooked hillary. read it & you will never be able to vote for her. @ed_kleinhttp://www.amazon.com/unlikeable problem hillary edward klein/dp/1621573788 … 
crooked hillary clinton overregulates, overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement 
i just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the f.e.c. even the dishonest media thinks great 
amazingly, with all of the money i have raised for the vets, i have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media. 
much of the money i have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups. 
while under no obligation to do so, i have raised between 5 & 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our veterans. nice 

i will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 p.m. enjoy 
obama’s va secretary just said we shouldn't measure wait times. hillary says va problems are not ‘widespread.’ i will take care of our vets 

in trade, military and everything else, it will be america first this will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: make america great again 

the american people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists 
bernie sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that crooked hillary clinton will be forced out of the race e mail scandal 

crooked hillary wants a radical 500% increase in syrian refugees. we can’t allow this. time to get smart and protect america 
how can crooked hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical islam, which horribly oppresses women? 
why do the networks continue to put dopey @billkristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs? 
hillary clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad would be four more years of stupidity 
crooked hillary said that i want guns brought into the school classroom. wrong 
@dubilujane: i trust @realdonaldtrump more anyone ever to protect america.he will do the right thing for the u.s.a, without a doubt. 

crooked hillary clintons foreign interventions unleashed isis in syria, iraq and libya. she is reckless and dangerous 

.@cnn is so negative, getting even worse as i get closer. just had two anti trump losers with zero rebuttal from my team. turning off 

crooked hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. no more guns to protect hillary 
while our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the tsa is falling apart, just like our government airports a total disaster 
crooked hillary is spending tremendous amounts of wall street money on false ads against me. she is a very dishonest person 
crooked hillary clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. no gun owner can ever vote for clinton 
thank you @thetodaysgolfer for the wonderful statement that the new par 3 9th hole @trump turnberry could be the most dramatic in britain. 
@montgomeriefdn colin, great to have you at trump turnberry. so proud of you and your great playing you made winning majors look easy 




failing @nytimes will always take a good story about me and make it bad. every article is unfair and biased. very sad 
thanks @piersmorgan trump is the most unpredictable, extraordinary, entertaining&massively popular candidate this country has ever seen. 


a call for unity by jason greenblatt @jasondovesqhttps://medium.com/@jgreenblatt/a call for unity 2e7a33eceef3#.k45jbtw9t … 
crooked hillary can't even close the deal with bernie and the dems have it rigged in favor of hillary. four more years of this? no way 
crooked hillary clinton looks presidential? i don't think so four more years of obama and our country will never come back. isis laughs 
look where the world is today, a total mess, and isis is still running around wild. i can fix it fast, hillary has no chance 
crooked hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. isis, china, russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years 
i said that crooked hillary clinton is not qualified to be president because she has very bad judgement bernie said the same thing 

how quality a woman is rowanne brewer lane to have exposed the @nytimes as a disgusting fraud? thank you rowanne. 
looks like yet another terrorist attack. airplane departed from paris. when will we get tough, smart and vigilant? great hate and sickness 
my list of potential u.s. supreme court justices was very well recieved. during the next number of weeks i may be adding to the list 
some low life journalist claims that i made a pass at her 29 years ago. never happened like the @nytimes story which has become a joke 



why did clinton supporter @alisonforky declare crooked hillary winner in ky when ap hasn't even called the race? 
bernie sanders is being treated very badly by the democrats the system is rigged against him. many of his disenfranchised fans are for me 
paul begala, the dopey @cnn flunky and head of the pro hillary clinton super pac, has knowingly committed fraud in his first ad against me. 
@shoneep: @realdonaldtrump trump for president bernie is a joke, knows nothing and hillary is yesterday's and today's nightmare 

congratulations to the movement, we have just won the great state of oregon. the vote percentage is even higher than anticipated thank you. 


@sandrajeanne48: no way i believe trump at 70% disapproval with women. went to 3 rallies. at least 1/2 women. msm lies @thefive 
michael barbaro, the author of the now discredited @nytimes hit piece on me with women, has in past tweeted badly about me. he should resign 
@michael_favreau: @jis3 @realdonaldtrump he will destroy hillary but why give cnn record breaking ratings cnn can go to hell. trump 2016 
i look so forward to debating crooked hillary clinton democrat primaries are rigged, e mail investigation is rigged so time to get it on 
i can't believe that @cnn would allow the very nice jeffrey lord to be savaged by a panel of seven trump haters. 7 to 1 don't watch cnn 
@cowboysfortrump: @christichat @rockprincess818 @realdonaldtrump that man is a pillar of strength and will be perfect as our next president

@manakoa:donaldtrump, you are fearless this interview shows you are the leader we need. @megynkelly is a tough interview respect to both 
@ragdollive: @megynkelly @realdonaldtrump what's with the soft wimpy questions? ? it's not a therapy session .. not really soft at all 
@xgodfatherxzx: @realdonaldtrump amazing on megan kelly thanks. 
@trumptrainrider: .@realdonaldtrump watching you on fox with @megynkelly now. can't wait to hear what you two talked about. 
i will be live tweeting @megynkelly show in 10 minutes. should be interesting. will be on fox network enjoy 
wall street paid for ad is a fraud, just like crooked hillary their main line had nothing to do with women, and they knew it. apologize? 
do you think crooked hillary will finally close the deal? if she can't win kentucky, she should drop out of race. system rigged 

i look forward to watching @megynkelly tonight, 8 pm et. it will be interesting to see how she treats me—i think she will be very fair. 
how can crooked hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for nafta, the worst economic deal in u.s. history? 
crooked hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.if so, he should run,not her.will he bring the energizer to d.c.? 

crooked hillary can't close the deal with bernie sanders. will be another bad day for her 
amazing that crooked hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the worst abuser of woman in u.s. political history 
oregon is voting today. keep the big numbers going vote trump make america great again 
crooked hillary clinton put out an ad where i am misquoted on women. can't believe she would misrepresent the facts my hit was on china 
the pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. you can tell them to go blank themselves was about china, not women 
wow, 30,000 e mails were deleted by crooked hillary clinton. she said they had to do with a wedding reception. liar how can she run? 

what barbara res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly, and for years, trying to come back. i said no. 
i gave a woman named barbara res a top n.y. construction job, when that was unheard of, and now she is nasty. so much for a nice thank you 
in politics, and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. this is a primary reason that president obama is the worst president in u.s. history 
the writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes, michael barbaro, who was interviewed on cbs this morning, was unable to respond. 
over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6. that’s because there were so many positive statements. 
no wonder the @nytimes is failing—who can believe what they write after the false, malicious & libelous story they did on me. 
the failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women. 
rowanne brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday joined @foxandfriends.https://amp.twimg.com/v/ebf3185d 9258 407b a53a a92289f9e7fb … 

with the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me, we have exposed the article as a fraud 
a political commentator for @cnn, which i no longer watch, said trump showed some weakness in the repub primaries. i set all time record 
wow, rowanne brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday, was on @foxandfriends saying times lied 
the @nytimes is so dishonest. their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by rowanne brewer, who said it was a lie 
that was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends i hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is 
bernie sanders is being treated very badly by the dems. the system is rigged against him. he should run as an independent run bernie, run. 

the @washingtonpost report on potential vp candidates is wrong. marco rubio and most others mentioned are not under consideration. 

the media is really on a witch hunt against me. false reporting, and plenty of it but we will prevail 
why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that i was so proud to have helped with their careers. dishonest 
wow, i have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece. massive front page for that 
why doesn't the failing @nytimes write the real story on the clintons and women? the media is totally dishonest 

@tzard000: @realdonaldtrump @nytimes everyone continues to pile onto donald, but they can never take away our votes thank you 
everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.i gave them many names of women i helped refused to use 

@mrtohney: leicester & donaldtrump seem to have the same trajectory, both were written off, but they keep scaling the heights. history? 
@queencharlotteo: @realdonaldtrump @nytimes i'm a women & i 100% support @realdonaldtrump & i have since the beginning. thank you 
the failing @nytimes wrote yet another hit piece on me. all are impressed with how nicely i have treated women, they found nothing. a joke 
thank you for the nice words this morning @kellyriddell. well delivered and totally logical @cnn @foxnews 

wow, @cnn is really working hard to make me look as bad as possible. very unprofessional. hurting in ratings bad television 

if crooked hillary clinton can't close the deal on crazy bernie, how is she going to take on china, russia, isis and all of the others? 

.@thehill your story about me & the carbon tax is absolutely incorrect—it is just the opposite. i will not support or endorse a carbon tax 
senator lindsey graham called me yesterday, very much to my surprise, and we had a very interesting talk about national security, and more 


if it were up to goofy elizabeth warren, we’d have no jobs in america—she doesn’t have a clue. 
in interview i told @ap that my taxes are under routine audit and i would release my tax returns when audit is complete, not after election 
isn’t it funny when a failed senator like goofy elizabeth warren can spend a whole day tweeting about trump & gets nothing done in senate? 
goofy elizabeth warren lied when she says i want to abolish the federal minimum wage. see media—asking for increase 
our native american senator, goofy elizabeth warren, couldn’t care less about the american worker…does nothing to help 
goofy elizabeth warren is now using the woman’s card like her friend crooked hillary. see her dumb tweet “when a woman stands up to you…” 
if the people of massachusetts found out what an ineffective senator goofy elizabeth warren has been, she would lose 
thanks piers.https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/730465526993039360 … 

goofy elizabeth warren didn’t have the guts to run for potus. her phony native american heritage stops that and vp cold. 
goofy elizabeth warren has been one of the least effective senators in the entire u.s. senate. she has done nothing 
i don't want to hit crazy bernie sanders too hard yet because i love watching what he is doing to crooked hillary. his time will come 
big wins in west virginia and nebraska. get ready for november crooked hillary, who is looking very bad against crazy bernie, will lose 


the clintons spend millions on negative ads on me & i can’t tell the truth about her husband? don’t feel sorry for crooked hillary 

it was so great being in nebraska last week. today is the big day get out and vote 
i look very much forward to meeting w/paul ryan & the gop party leadership on thurs in dc. together, we will beat the dems at all levels 
via @jtanews and jason greenblatt donald trump is a visionary with talents our country needs @jasondovesqhttp://www.jta.org/2016/04/18/news opinion/politics/donald trump is a visionary with talents our country needs … 


it is only the people that were never asked to be vp that tell the press that they will not take the position. 
it was rosie o'donnell who ate the cake in the vicious hillary commercial about me, not crooked hillary @marthamaccallum 
why does the media, with a strong push from crooked hillary, keep pushing the false narrative that i want to raise taxes. exactly opposite 

get out and vote nebraska, we will make america great again 
get out and vote west virginia, we will make america great again 


i am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. any negotiated increase by congress to my proposal would still be lower than current 
i will have set the all time record in primary votes in the republican party despite having to compete against 17 other people 
if i only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like hillary clinton, i would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did 
crooked hillary clinton says that she got more primary votes than donald trump. but i had 17 people to beat—she had one 



@daybastrop @foxandfriends @bretbaier the liars that signed the pledge and now won't support @realdonaldtrump is the reason they are losers 
@nathandwilsonfl: @mariabartiromo you had a great interview with donald today i started watching your show due to donald trump. 
will be interviewed by @mariabartiromo on @foxbizalert at 7:30 a.m. enjoy 
@richbooth6: @realdonaldtrump @cnn good interview mr. trump. you set the facts straight. thank you. 
wow, i hear @morning_joe has gone really hostile ever since i said i won't do or watch the show anymore.they misrepresent my positions 
i will be interviewed on @cnn at 7:00 a.m. 
.@drmoore russell moore is truly a terrible representative of evangelicals and all of the good they stand for. a nasty guy with no heart 

i will be interviewed on @newday @cnn at 7:00 a.m. 
i will win the election against crooked hillary despite the people in the republican party that are currently and selfishly opposed to me 
on @seanhannity show @foxnews now. enjoy 
crooked hillary just can't close the deal with bernie. it will be the same way with isis, and china on trade, and mexico at the border. bad 
.@kellyannepolls kellyanne, you were fantastic on @meetthepress today. keep going i will win for the people. make america great again 
i will be interviewed on @meetthepress this morning. enjoy 
i will be interviewed on this week with george s this morning. enjoy 

@matandsher: i want a leader that will shoot straight with us. the politicians can't. @realdonaldtrump will give his all for us 
.@edgoeas thank you for your support tonight on @judgejeanine. 
remember when the two failed presidential candidates, lindsey graham and jeb bush, signed a binding pledge? they broke the deal, no honor 
i am honored that the great men and women of the @teamsters have created a movement from within called teamsters for trump thank you. 
i am going to keep our jobs in the u.s., and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. crooked hillary has no clue @teamsters 

goofy elizabeth warren is weak and ineffective. does nothing. all talk, no action maybe her native american name? 
goofy elizabeth warren and her phony native american heritage are on a twitter rant. she is too easy i'm driving her nuts. 
crooked hillary clinton wants completely open borders. millions of democrats will run from her over this and support me. 
just met with courageous family of sarah root in nebraska. sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy. 
goofy elizabeth warren, hillary clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. she is not native american. 
let’s properly check goofy elizabeth warren’s records to see if she is native american. i say she’s a fraud 
i hope corrupt hillary clinton chooses goofy elizabeth warren as her running mate. i will defeat them both. 

i hear @joenbc of rapidly fading @morning_joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. this will guarantee a crooked hillary win. 
joe scarborough initially endorsed jeb bush and jeb crashed, then john kasich and that didn't work. not much power or insight 
thank you to teachers across america when i become potus we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now. 
crooked hillary has zero leadership ability. as bernie sanders says, she has bad judgement. constantly playing the women's card it is sad 
paul ryan said that i inherited something very special, the republican party. wrong, i didn't inherit it, i won it with millions of voters 

so many great endorsements yesterday, except for paul ryan we must put america first and make america great again 
governor rick perry said donald trump is one of the most talented people running for the presidency i've ever seen. thank you rick 
unlike crooked hillary clinton, who wants to destroy all miners, i want wages to go up in america. we will do so by bringing back jobs 

can you believe crooked hillary said, we are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&coal companies out of business. she then apologized. 

bernie sanders has been treated terribly by the democrats—both with delegates & otherwise. he should show them, & run as an independent. 

i will be interviewed by @bretbaier @specialreport at 6pm et tonight @foxnews 
many reports that i will be attending the alvarez/khan fight this weekend in vegas. totally untrue unfortunately i have other plans. 

i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30 a.m. enjoy 
i will be interviewed on @todayshow and good morning america at 7:00 a.m. 
i will be interviewed on @morning_joe at 6:15 a.m. enjoy 
i would rather run against crooked hillary clinton than bernie sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against bernie 
what a great evening we had. so interesting that sanders beat crooked hillary. the dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him 
.@oreillyfactor please correct, i won virginia 
thank you indiana, we were just projected to be the winner. we have won in every category. you are very special people i will never forget 

lyin' ted cruz consistently said that he will, and must, win indiana. if he doesn't he should drop out of the race stop wasting time & money 
wow, lyin' ted cruz really went wacko today. made all sorts of crazy charges. can't function under pressure not very presidential. sad 







will be in south bend, indiana in a short while big rally see you soon 





i will be campaigning in indiana all day. things are looking great, and the support of bobby knight has been so amazing. today will be fun 
everybody is talking about the protesters burning the american flags and proudly waving mexican flags. i want america first so do voters 
gov mike pence has just stated that donald trump has taken a strong stance on hoosier jobs, and he thanks me i will bring back jobs to usa. 
crooked hillary clinton said she is used to dealing with men who get off the reservation. actually, she has done poorly with such men 
i will be interviewed on @cnn @newday at 7:30 a.m. enjoy 



.@karlrove is a failed jeb bushy. never says anything good & never will, even after i beat hillary. shouldn't be on the air 

will be in terre haute, indiana in a short while big rally see you soon 
i watched sen. graham @facethenation. why don't they say that i ran him out of the race like a little boy, and in the end he had no support? 

i will be in indiana on sunday and monday at four make america great again rallies. see you there 
thank you @mikeozanian for the nice comments on @foxnews today. great job 

the economy is bad and getting worse almost zero growth this quarter. nobody can beat me on the economy (and jobs). make america great again 

the protesters in california were thugs and criminals. many are professionals. they should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement 
.@ac360 anderson, so amazing. your mother is, and always has been, an incredible woman 
we are now at 1001 delegates. we will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged 

crooked hillary clinton, perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency, is also one of the all time great enablers 
wow, the ridiculous deal made between lyin'ted cruz and 1 for 42 john kasich has just blown up. what a dumb deal dead on arrival 







so many false and phony t.v. commercials being broadcast in indiana. reminds me of florida where thousands were put up i won in a landslide 
i will be in evansville, indiana, with the great bobby knight (who last night endorsed me) at 12:00 this afternoon. see you there 
lyin' ted cruz, who can never beat hillary clinton and has no path to victory, has chosen a v.p.candidate who failed badly in her own effort 
i will be interviewed on the @todayshow at 7:00 a.m. this morning. enjoy 
thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech. i will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics 
@annettejeanne: i cried when they said you made a clean sweep of all 5 states. i was so happy i really adore you mr. trump, so much. 
getting the strong endorsement of the great coach, bobby knight, has been a highlight of my stay in indiana. big speech tomorrow with bobby 
i am in indiana where we just had a great rally. fantastic people staying at a holiday inn express new and clean, not bad 





















how bad is the new york times—the most inaccurate coverage constantly. always trying to belittle. paper has lost its way 

bernie sanders has been treated terribly by the democrats—both with delegates & otherwise. he should show them, and run as an independent 


the cruz kasich pact is under great strain. this joke of a deal is falling apart, not being honored and almost dead. very dumb 





on the way to the great state of rhode island big rally. then to pennsylvania for rest of day and night 
kasich just announced that he wants the people of indiana to vote for him. typical politician can't make a deal work. 
shows how weak and desperate lyin' ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses. 
lyin' ted cruz and 1 for 38 kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. shows weakness 
lyin' ted and kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. sad 
wow, just announced that lyin' ted and kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the republican nomination. desperation 
i am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. it is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. becoming irrelevant 
@diamondandsilk: .@donaldjtrumpjr awesome job on @cnnsotu. donaldtrump has integrity & he refuses 2 play the game call delegate bribery 

i will be in maryland this afternoon for a major rally. things are looking good for tuesday 
.@andrebauer great job and advice on @cnn @jaketapper thank you 
.@borisep was great on @judgejeanine tonight. very smart commentary that will prove to be correct 
as soon as john kasich is hit with negative ads, he will drop like a rock in the polls against crooked hillary clinton. i will win 
i had a great day campaigning in connecticut. looking for a big vote on tuesday 
congratulations to @seanhannity on his great ratings and ratings increase as reported by the @ap today. amazing job 






will be spending the day campaigning in connecticut, another state where jobs are being stolen by other countries. i will stop this fast 





i met prince on numerous occasions. he was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. he will be greatly missed 
cruz said kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. now he can't get to 1237. drop out lyin' ted. 
both ted cruz and john kasich have no path to victory. they should both drop out of the race so that the republican party can unify 
senator ted cruz has been mathematically eliminated from race. he said kasich should get out for same reason. i think both should get out 
i will be doing the @todayshow with my wife, melania, and the rest of my family in a major town hall. hopefully, it will be fun enjoy.7a.m. 

we are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to indiana 




ted cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do. i will beat hillary 


thank you new york, i will never forget 

.@cnn is so negative it is impossible to watch. terrible panel, angry haters. bill o @oreillyfactor said such an amazing thing about me 


@kdk144: @realdonaldtrump everybody is in a new york state of mind now 



who did the house task force on urgent fiscal issues call when america needed help?https://amp.twimg.com/v/6d5ebafa 67c0 48ea b4e6 82928b5c5851 … 





a big day for new york and for our country make america great again 
i am on @foxandfriends at 7:00 a.m. enjoy 


lyin’ ted cruz even voted against superstorm sandy aid and september 11th help. so many new yorkers devastated. cruz hates new york 

kasich only looks o.k. in polls against hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed zero negative ads against him 
lyin' ted cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses i am millions of votes ahead hillary would destroy him & k 
@diamondandsilk: .@realdonaldtrump is who we need 2 fix this corrupted, rigged system. 4 no profit, under budget & ahead of schedule. 


i would have millions of votes more than hillary except for the fact that i had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named bernie 
crooked hillary clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. i am the one person she doesn't want to run against. will be such fun 
lyin' ted cruz can't get votes (i am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the republican bosses. it won't work 
lyin' ted cruz will never be able to beat hillary. despite a rigged delegate system, i am hundreds of delegates ahead of him. 
i'll be in one of my favorite places this morning, staten island. big crowd, will be fun 





@ashleyedam: new cbs poll shows defections from cruz's core supporters & increased support for @realdonaldtrump ...not surprising.

@dmharvey89: @realdonaldtrump @wdct8110 i just voted for @realdonaldtrump in indiana. everyone i talk to was following suit fantastic 
@herb_stamper: @jackoffjosh711 @senfrankniceley @foxnews @wsj we are becoming a third world country because of jerks like him great 

@bubble709_: @realdonaldtrump praying for your family and your win in new york. thank you 






big protest march in colorado on friday afternoon don't let the bosses take your vote 
the rules did change in colorado shortly after i entered the race in june because the pols and their bosses knew i would win with the voters 
biggest story in politics is now happening in the great state of colorado where over one million people have been precluded from voting 




great to be on @andersoncooper tonight with my wonderful family. will be rebroadcast at 12:00 a.m. (eastern).

@timehascome1: @waynedupreeshow @thepatriot143 trump needs to hold a massive protest rally in colorado. he'd get 100k & own the news cycle 
i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:00 a.m. enjoy 
the people of colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. biggest story in politics. this will not be allowed 
how is it possible that the people of the great state of colorado never got to vote in the republican primary? great anger totally unfair 

i win a state in votes and then get non representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by cruz campaign. bad system 
the @nytimes purposely covers me so inaccurately. i want other nations to pay the u.s. for our defense of them. we are the suckers no more 

@getreal1234: @realdonaldtrump @kids123nicholas @gqforbes @reptommarino let's go pa he has my vote go trump 

@becker_berta: @vivhall3 @reince millions more will burn their republican registration if gop continues to subvert the will of the people. 
@metalmom888: @theresa_cali if the gop screws trump, his millions will walk from the gop never to return they better think long and hard 
@anncoulter: gop is trying to steal nomination from the winner (trump) not block an insurgent catching up 2 frontrunner (sanders). 

@mutual408grace: @realdonaldtrump @gene70 california women love mr trump too. will make it happen in new york on april 19. go out & vote. 
@kids123nicholas: @gqforbes @reptommarino @realdonaldtrump.lets get it done philadelphia pa.make trump your pick for president now. 






bernie sanders says that hillary clinton is unqualified to be president. based on her decision making ability, i can go along with that 
isn't it a shame that the person who will have by far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else, me, still must fight 

@alexnightrasor: @realdonaldtrump @lilrachiepoo trump will be our best president since reagan

@wheels155:@cnn is reviewing the week,but majority of the show about @realdonaldtrump cuz there would be 0.0 ratings if not. media's a joke 
i will be on @foxnewssunday with chris wallace this morning. enjoy 




.@foxnews should be ashamed for allowing experts to explain how to make a nuclear attack 
.@heytammybruce thank you for your nice words on fox today. they never use my full statements on nuclear, which you would agree with 


wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade, but if i win, all of the bad things happening in the u.s. will be rapidly reversed 
i will be in wisconsin until the election. jobs, trade and immigration will be big factors. i will bring jobs back home make great deals 
if @megynkelly stopped covering me on her show, her ratings would drop like a rock my h to h interview with @ac360 beat her by millions 
is it possible for @megynkelly to cover anyone but donald trump on her terrible show. she totally misrepresents my words and positions bad. 

can you believe that ted cruz, who has been killing our country on trade for so long, just put out a wisconsin ad talking about trade? 



for the 1st time in american history, america’s 16,500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsement—me thank you. 
the national border patrol council (nbpc) said that our open border is the biggest physical & economic threat facing the american people 
the club for growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (cruz) plus 143 delegates (kasich) is more than my 739 delegates. try again 
the club for growth,which asked me for $1,000,000 in an extortion attempt, just put up a wisconsin ad with incorrect math.what a dumb group 




just had a very nice meeting with @reince priebus and the @gop. looking forward to bringing the party together and it will happen 


@gearssuxs: @loudobbsnews @realdonaldtrump i'm a democrat and switch over to republican just to vote for trump in the primary. great 


please keep your thoughts & prayers with melissa young miss wisconsin 2005.http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/30/politics/trump miss wisconsin emotional moment/index.html?sr=twcnn033016trump miss wisconsin emotional moment0214pmstorylink&linkid=22869280 … 

.@davidgregory got thrown off of tv by nbc, fired like a dog now he is on @cnn being nasty to me. not nice 


trump defends campaign manager charged for bruising a reporter:http://dailym.ai/1v15tu3  


why is this reporter touching me as i leave news conference? what is in her hand??pic.twitter.com/hqb8dl0fhn 
this was the reporters statement when she found out there was tape from my facility, she changed her tune.pic.twitter.com/n5815rs1at 
victory press conference was over. why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? can i press charges?pic.twitter.com/qbw2rjkinx 
why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape? 
wow, corey lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. look at tapes nothing there 
how come the @todayshow & @chucktodd show the new @nbcnews poll for hillary vs bernie but do not show the same poll where i am killing cruz? 
i have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than cruz or kasich, and yet am not being treated properly by the republican party or the rnc. 
wow, @cnn has nothing but my opponents on their shows. really one sided and unfair reporting. maybe i shouldn't do their town hall tonight 
we need to secure our borders asap. no games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant. make america great again & make america strong again 
lyin' ted, i have already beaten you in all debates, and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. you should focus on jobs & illegal imm 
lyin'ted cruz is weak & losing big, so now he wants to debate again. but, according to drudge,time and on line polls, i have won all debates 
after the way i beat gov. scott walker (and jeb, rand, marco and all others) in the presidential primaries, no way he would ever endorse me 
@pauladuvall2: cruz will say anything that is contrary to what you have to say. if you're for motherhood, he'll be against it 
just released that international gangs are all over our cities. this will end when i am president 
@wolfblitzer: campaign to date popular gop totals: @realdonaldtrump 7,546,980; @tedcruz 5,481,737; @johnkasich 2,724,749 a big difference 
ted cruz is incensed that i want to refocus nato on terrorism, as well as current mission, but also want others to pay fair share, a must 
a detainee released from gitmo has killed an american. when will our so called leaders ever learn 
kirsten powers: anti trump operative was aggressively shopping cruz story via the gateway pundit:http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/03/kirsten powers anti trump operative aggressively shopping cruz sex scandal video/ … 
@nellalda: @realdonaldtrump we stand by trump 100% thank you 
i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30. things are looking good, had a great easter look forward to spending the week in wisconsin 

the united states cannot continue to make such bad, one sided trade deals. there are only so many jobs we can give up. no more 

just to show you how unfair republican primary politics can be, i won the state of louisiana and get less delegates than cruz lawsuit coming 
why can't the pundits be honest? hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. i will make it strong and great jobs 
another radical islamic attack, this time in pakistan, targeting christian women & children. at least 67 dead,400 injured. i alone can solve 
happy easter to all, have a great day 
my statement on nato being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the u.s. are now, finally, receiving plaudits 
wow, sleepy eyes @chucktodd is at it again. he is do totally biased. the things i am saying are correct. far better vision than the others 
i am interviewed on this week on @abc this morning. enjoy 
remember, i am the only candidate who is self funding. while i am given little credit for this by the voters, i am not bought like others 
don't believe the @foxnews polls, they are just another phony hit job on me. i will beat hillary clinton easily in the general election. 
wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in u.s., jobs are leaving. i will make our economy strong again bring in jobs 
nobody will protect our nation like donald j. trump. our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. illegals out 
lyin' ted cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with the national enq.were caused by me. i had nothing to do with story 
the press is going out of their way to convince people that i do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite 
the media is so after me on women wow, this is a tough business. nobody has more respect for women than donald trump 

@tytan01: dear @cnn, after doing a quick google & twitter search there are over 15,000 women's groups supporting donaldtrump. stop lying. 


@theageofleo: your instincts on foreign policy & terrorism have been better than all of these so called experienced politicians combined. 
top suspect in paris massacre, salah abdeslam, who also knew of the brussels attack, is no longer talking. weak leaders, ridiculous laws 

wow, just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. how am i still number one by a lot? 
i didn't start the fight with lyin'ted cruz over the gq cover pic of melania, he did. he knew the pac was putting it out hence, lyin' ted 
just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the trump u case but the press refuses to write about it. if i lost monster story 



europe and the u.s. must immediately stop taking in people from syria. this will be the destruction of civilization as we know it so sad 
just announced that as many as 5000 isis fighters have infiltrated europe. also, many in u.s. i told you so i alone can fix this problem 
@doctor_s_freud: @theview they're all brain dead puppets with skeletons in their closet. i say you go on and destroy them all a dead show 
explain how the women on the view, which is a total disaster since the great barbara walters left, ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time 
.@theview t.v. show, which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air, is constantly asking me to go on. i tell them no 
hillary clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. time for a change, i will solve and fast 

it is amazing how often i am right, only to be criticized by the media. illegal immigration, take the oil, build the wall, muslims, nato 
remember when i recently said that brussels is a hell hole and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. i was so right 
these politicians like cruz and graham, who have watched isis and many other problems develop for years, do nothing to make things better 
.@lindseygrahamsc and lyin' ted cruz are two politicians who are very much alike all talk and no action both talk about isis, do nothing 
it is amazing how @lindseygrahamsc gets on so many t.v. shows talking negatively about me when i beat him so badly (zero) in his pres run 
@missi51: .@realdonaldtrump thank god is not a politician, but he's one heck of a fighter who will fight for us, the people. 
we pay a disproportionate share of the cost of n.a.t.o. why? it is time to renegotiate, and the time is now 
n.a.t.o. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on 

@kj11100me: @realdonaldtrump donald trump will be greater president than ragan. trump will set the button for morality,christianity. 
@tcsorr: @jphilman0206 @realdonaldtrump self funded and media loves him. not beholden to masters like @tedcruz. who owns ted? 

make america great again 
i want to thank @realsheriffjoe for all of his help in our historic arizona win. could not have done it without you joe 
while i believe i will clinch before cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race 
i think having jeb's endorsement hurts lyin' ted. jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing. i spent a fraction of that and am first 
i will be the best by far in fighting terror. i’m the only one that was right from the beginning, & now lyin’ ted & others are copying me. 
just watched hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. she’s been in office fighting terror for 20 years and look where we are 
low energy jeb bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, lyin’ ted cruz. honestly, i can’t blame jeb in that i drove him into oblivion 
lyin’ ted cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from michael douglas— just another dishonest politician. 

lyin' ted cruz denied that he had anything to do with the g.q. model photo post of melania. that's why we call him lyin' ted 
hopefully the republican party can come together and have a big win in november, paving the way for many great supreme court justices 
much bigger win than anticipated in arizona. thank you, i will never forget 

incompetent hillary, despite the horrible attack in brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open and let the muslims flow in. no way 
lyin' ted cruz just used a picture of melania from a g.q. shoot in his ad. be careful, lyin' ted, or i will spill the beans on your wife 

obama, and all others, have been so weak, and so politically correct, that terror groups are forming and getting stronger shame. 





i have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody and it’s not even close. hopefully az and ut will be voting for me today 
make america great again 
president obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in cuba, especially in the shadows of brussels. he is being treated badly 
do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place brussels was. not anymore, it is from a different world u.s. must be vigilant and smart 

@barrong510: @realdonaldtrump the media is corrupt we the people are fighting with you. 
wow, president obama just landed in cuba, a big deal, and raul castro wasn't even there to greet him. he greeted pope and others. no respect 
big republican dinner tonight at mar a lago in palm beach. i will be there 
@gamzorz: @megynkelly dont worry trump, they are losing thousands of viewers and money. roger ailes will be telling megyn to stop 
so the highly overrated anchor, @megynkelly, is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show, but i can't fight back? wrong 
the protesters blocked a major highway yesterday, delaying entry to my rally in arizona by hours, and the media blames my supporters 
why is it that the horrendous protesters, who scream, curse punch, shut down roads/doors during my rallies, are never blamed by media? sad 
will be interviewed on @thisweekabc this morning. enjoy 
@gstephanopoulos: what’s @realdonaldtrump's strategy to secure the gop nomination? i’ll talk to the republican front runner. @thisweekabc. 
the rallies in utah and arizona were great tremendous crowds and spirit. just returned but will be going back soon. 
@jojo2foxy: trump is not afraid of anything or anyone that's the president usa needs to unite us & knock the socks off our enemies 






wow, @cnn ratings are up 75% because it's all trump, all the time. the networks are making a fortune off of me make america great again 

if crazy @megynkelly didn't cover me so much on her terrible show, her ratings would totally tank. she is so average in so many ways 
crazy @megynkelly says i don't (won't) go on her show and she still gets good ratings. but almost all of her shows are negative hits on me 



@ma1973sk: actually, no @foxnews, @megynkelly has a sick obsession with trump. every day, every show, trashing, negative, hate. 




@cmichaeld2004: realistic trump poll numbers translate to the 70 percentile range in a two man race. gee, what happened to that 30% ceiling 
@ileanabarkus: @nytdavidbrooks i totally agree @nytdavidbrooks is strictly conceptual and theoretical and has no commonsense 


reading @nytdavidbrooks of the ny times is a total waste of time, he is a clown with no awareness of the world around him dummy 
while i have never met @nytdavidbrooks of the ny times, i consider him one of the dumbest of all pundits he has no sense of the real world 

watching @loudobbsnews fantastic show has very interesting take on paul ryan. 
just leaving salt lake city, utah fantastic crowd with no interruptions. love utah will be back 
why haven't they released the final missouri victory for us yet? could it be because cruz's guy runs missouri? 

do you believe that hillary clinton now wants obamacare for illegal immigrants? she should spend more time taking care of our great vets 
everybody should boycott the @megynkelly show. never worth watching. always a hit on trump she is sick, & the most overrated person on tv. 


mitt romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. no wonder he lost 
failed presidential candidate mitt romney was campaigning with john kasich & marco rubio, and now he is endorsing ted cruz. 1/2 
failed presidential candidate mitt romney, the man who choked and let us all down, is now endorsing lyin' ted cruz. this is good for me 
going to salt lake city, utah, for a big rally. lyin' ted cruz should not be allowed to win there mormons don't like liars i beat hillary 

club for growth tried to extort $1,000,000 from me. when i said no, they went hostile with negative ads. disgraceful 
with millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment, my numbers continue to go up. can anyone explain this? 
.@ewerickson got fired like a dog from redstate and now he is the one leading opposition against me. 
senator @lindseygrahamsc made horrible statements about @sentedcruz – and then he endorsed him. no wonder nobody trusts politicians 
lyin' ted cruz lost all five races on tuesday and he was just given the jinx a lindsey graham endorsement. also backed jeb. lindsey got 0 

hillary clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life 
make america great again 

highly overrated & crazy @megynkelly is always complaining about trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. focus on others megyn 
looking like my 5 victories on tuesday will be just as good as if i won ohio. two more days and ohio was mine 
see you in arizona on friday and saturday.https://twitter.com/foxbusiness/status/710488907121438720 … 
please explain to the dummies at the @wsj editorial board that i love to debate and have won, according to drudge etc., all 11 of them 
.@wsj is bad at math. the good news is, nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore, especially me 
.@wsj editorial says clinton primary vote total is 8,646,551.trump's is 7,533,692 a knock. but she had only 3 opponents i had 16.apologize 
the reason lyin' ted cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars a big problem 
crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.tough 
great news that @foxnews has cancelled the additional debate. how many times can the same people ask the same question? i beat cruz debating 
crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lyin' ted cruz on her show last night. ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. ted can't win 
stuart stevens, the failed campaign manager of mitt romney's historic loss, is now telling the republican party what to do with trump. sad 
i will be interviewed on the o'reilly factor this evening at 8 pm on the fox news channel. @oreillyfactor 

wow, just won missouri 
i am making a big speech the night of the @foxnews debate, but i wish everyone well. yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins 
thank you to the governor of florida, rick scott, for your endorsement. i greatly appreciate your support 
in the last 2 weeks, i had $35m of negative ads against me in florida & i won in a massive landslide.the establishment should save their $$ 
yesterday was amazing—5 victories. lyin’ ted cruz had zero. things are going very well 

.@reptommarino great job on television this morning. glad to have you on my side 
@foxbusiness: .@reptommarino: i think @realdonaldtrump can beat hillaryclinton. and i'm looking forward to trump being president. 
.@pastormarkburns you were great last night and we all very much appreciate it thank you 
i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:30 a.m. enjoy 
will be interviewed on @morning_joe at 7:40. enjoy 
will be interviewed on @newday on @cnn at 7:15 a.m. 
will be interviewed on @gma at 7:00 a.m. big wins last night 
@lucyric13835428: @realdonaldtrump @megynkelly that's funny, i switched to other media too, can't stand her 


i only wish my wonderful daughter tiffany could have been with us at mar a lago for our great election victory. she is a winner 


watching other networks and local news. really good night crazy @megynkelly is unwatchable. 


can't watch crazy megyn anymore. talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race. with two people, big & over 
@dumpfoxnews: @foxnews @megynkelly if media wasn't so biased against trump, he would've won all of the delegates. 
@scnak45: @megynkelly is trying so hard to bash @realdonaldtrump it's ridiculous don't worry, everyone is wise to crazy megyn 

@jsconlon11: @bertshad @foxnews @megynkelly i tried to give them a shot tonight, but they have the whole anti trump cheerleading team. 
@gregens21: @bertshad @foxnews @megynkelly she's choking on the results call her justifiable kelly. justifying everything she says. 

word is that, despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads, i had a massive victory in florida. numbers out soon 
a lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in florida? hope this is false. 
i will bring our jobs back to the u.s., and keep our companies from leaving. nobody else can do it. our economy will sing again. 
in presidential voting so far, john kasich is zero for 22. so why would he be a good candidate? hillary would beat him, i will beat hillary 
ohio is losing jobs to mexico, now losing ford (and many others). kasich is weak on illegal immigration. we need strong borders now 
watching john kasich being interviewed acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. remember him in second debate, until i put him down. 

north carolina lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs and ohio lost 400,000 since 2000. going to mexico etc. no more if i win, we will bring back 


don't reward mitt romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for kasich (who voted for nafta, open borders etc.). 
please remember, i am the only candidate who is self funding his campaign. kasich, rubio and cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists 
i will bring our jobs back to america, fix our military and take care of our vets, end common core and obamacare, protect 2nd a, build wall 
rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the u.s. senate in many years. he will never make america great again 
kasich voted for nafta, a disaster for ohio, and now wants the even worse tpp approved. vote trump and end this madness 


@realwwshelton: @loudobbsnews i believe that @realdonaldtrump will be the big winner tomorrow. thank you 
@brazielcarol: @foxnews @realdonaldtrump who started this mess, the protesters of course . and media made it worse. 



gov kasich voted for nafta, which devastated ohio and is now pushing tpp hard bad for american workers 

look forward to being in tampa this afternoon. wonderful crowds. thank you, florida 


lyin' tedpic.twitter.com/q0qxdgcn1l 
the failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers. they knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. really bad people 
because gov. kasich cannot run in the state of pennsylvania he cannot win the nomination & should not be allowed to compete in ohio on tue. 


gov.kasich of ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television, he only watches the @golfchannel 
ohio gov.kasich voted for nafta, from which ohio has never recovered. now he wants tpp, which will be even worse. ohio steel and coal dying 
bernie sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. be careful bernie, or my supporters will go to yours 
@alextrent4: it is repulsive that trump was assaulted politicians used that 2 further themselves 2 further victimize trump disgusting 
wow, kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of pennsylvania, not enough signatures. big problem 

do the people of ohio know that john kasich is strongly in favor of common core in other words, education of your children from d.c. no way 


it is clinton and sanders people who disrupted my rally in chicago and then they say i must talk to my people. phony politicians 
the last person that hillary or bernie want to run against is donald trump and that is fact 
we are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in florida on behalf of little marco rubio. no way to run a country 
word is early voting in fl is very dishonest. little marco, his state chairman, & their minions are working overtime trying to rig the vote. 


make america great again 
on my way to dayton, ohio. will be there soon 
the rally in cincinnati is on. media put out false reports that it was cancelled. will be great love you ohio 
ohio had the biggest budget increase in the u.s. if it were not for striking oil, they would be bust governor kasich in favor of tpp fraud 
absentee governor kasich voted for nafta and nafta devastated ohio a disaster from which it never recovered. kasich is good for mexico 
the organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our first amendment rights in chicago, have totally energized america 


it means so much to me receiving an endorsement from phyllis schlafly. a truly great woman & conservative.pic.twitter.com/11remu99qc 

rumor has it that @politico is going out of business. losing too much money. great news likewise, dopey mort zuckerman's @nydailynews 

dr. ben carson i concur. i believe in god who can change people he can make any of us better. @realbencarson 





wow, you are all correct about @foxnews totally biased and disgusting reporting. 


phony club for growth tried to shake me down for one million dollars, & is now putting out nasty negative ads on me. they are total losers 

this was a great evening i would like to thank everyone for their wonderful support. 




word is i am doing very well in michigan and mississippi wow, and with all that money spent against me will be going to trump jupiter now 
i hear @nbcnews / @wsj came out with another one of their phony polls. while i am leading, they are totally discredited after last s.c. poll 






mitt romney had his chance and blew it. lindsey graham ran for president, got zero, and quit why are they now spokesmen against me? sad 
remember, i am the only one who is self funding my campaign. all of the other candidates are bought and paid for by special interests 
sun sentinel says: rubio lacks the experience, work ethic and gravitas needed to be president. he has not earned your vote 
make america great again 


the club for growth is a very dishonest group. they represent conservative values terribly & are bad for america.http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot box/272013 club for growth action spends 2 million on anti trump ads …

lightweight senator marco rubio features trump univ. students in fl. attack ads who submitted excellent reviews.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqfsbqgplae … 

it was great being in michigan. remember, i am the only presidential candidate who will bring jobs back to the u.s.and protect car industry 
don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight rubio and the r establishment. dishonest people 
leaving for north carolina. big crowd, will be fun 
congratulation to adam scott and all of the folks at trump national doral on producing a really great wgc tournament. amazing finish 
i will be using facebook and twitter to expose dishonest lightweight senator marco rubio. a record no show in senate, he is scamming florida 
we cannot let the failing republican establishment, who could not stop obama (twice), ruin the movement with millions of $'s in false ads 
lindsey graham is all over t.v., much like failed 47% candidate mitt romney. these nasty, angry, jealous failures have zero credibility 
failed presidential candidate lindsey graham should respect me. i destroyed his run, brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out. now nasty 
how do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians? i will be using facebook & twitter. watch 
all of the phony t.v. commercials against me are bought and payed for by special interest groups, the bandits that tell your pols what to do 


.@meetthepress and @chucktodd did a 1 hour hit job on me today – totally biased and mostly false. dishonest media 
i am at trump national doral best resort in u.s. rory and adam scott are doing great watch on nbc at 3:00 p.m. make america great again 


the primary plaintiff in the phony trump university suit wants to abandon the case. disgraceful 
nancy reagan, the wife of a truly great president, was an amazing woman. she will be missed 
david brooks, of the new york times, is closing in on being the dumbest of them all. he doesn’t have a clue. 


i will be interviewed on @facethenation this morning. enjoy @jdickerson 
.@foxnews is devastated that lightweight senator marco rubio got trounced tonight and is the big loser. i won the two big states, great 


i will be at the cadillac world golf championship @trumpdoral in miami tomorrow rory, phil, bubba, adam, and dustin all at the top 



romney's failed advisors, like campaign mgr stuart stevens are all over tv telling people how to win. but they lost don't know how to win 
.@mittromney was a disaster candidate who had no guts and choked romney is a total joke, and everyone knows it 
thank you, kansas the line going into the orlando event is over a mile long. massive crowd expected. leaving kansas now, be there soon 




why would anyone in kentucky listen to failed presidential candidate rand paul re: caucus. made a fool of himself (1%.) ky his 2nd choice 
will be in orlando, florida, this afternoon. 25,000 people expected. this is a movement like our great country has never seen before 
wow, big lines in kansas. 
for all of today's voters please remember that i am the only candidate that is self funding my campaign, i am not bought and paid for 
great time last night in louisiana. big and energetic crowd. go out and vote now, polls open. make america great again 
i am in kansas. will be an exciting day. big speech this morning in wichita, and then go to caucus. sorry cpac (the format was fine ). 








@angiesteinberg: get that pos wsj liar fantasy pundit @marykissel off the air. blah blah. a real dummy @morning_joe @realdonaldtrump 



rubio puts out ad that my pilot was a drug dealer not true, not my pilot guy owned helicopter company don't think i ever even used. 




go to trump doral in miami and watch the world golf championship on now 

@creativexwalk: @realdonaldtrump teaching the gop how to lose four years ago was not enough. now romney wants to do it again. 
the phony lawsuit against trump u could have been easily settled by me but i want to go to court. 98% approval rating by students. easy win 
why did mitt romney beg me for my endorsement four years ago? 
i am the only one who can beat hillary clinton. i am not a mitt romney, who doesn't know how to win. hillary wants no part of trump 
why would the great people of florida vote for a guy who, as a senator, never even shows up to vote worst record. marco rubio is a joke 
i have brought millions of people into the republican party, while the dems are going down. establishment wants to kill this movement 
failed candidate mitt romney,who ran one of the worst races in presidential history,is working with the establishment to bury a big r win 
@malski1954: i changed parties to vote for you, no one else measures up to you, the gope needs a reality check. our country is at stake 
looks like two time failed candidate mitt romney is going to be telling republicans how to get elected. not a good messenger 
millions of dollars being spent on false tv ads by special interest groups who own rubio & cruz.when you see them think of your puppet pols 
@johnsmi01433966: the establishment doesn't like you because they can't control you and get you to lie to us and keep ripping us off. 
because of me, the republican party has taken in millions of new voters, a record. if they are not careful, they will all leave. sad 


just another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten barrack obama. (2/2) 
failed presidential candidate mitt romney is having a news conference tomorrow to criticize me. (1/2) 

.@cnn poll just hit 49% for trump. interesting how my numbers have gone so far up since lightweight marco rubio has turned nasty. love it 

why can't the leaders of the republican party see that i am bringing in new voters by the millions we are creating a larger, stronger party 

@kinnardjan: @itsjoeco @realdonaldtrump i took trump university class and saved my home 
marco rubio lost big last night. i even beat him in virginia, where he spent so much time and money. now his bosses are desperate and angry 
why would anyone in florida vote for lightweight senator marco rubio. check out his credit card scam, his house sale & his no show voting 
the special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent t.v. ads on me. 
@joenbc: fox calls virginia for trump. if it holds, it's a big win for trump and a big setback for rubio, who needed to win the state. 

@norahodonnell: looks like rubio won't get any delegates from tx or al because he didn't meet 20% threshold. 

@danpfeiffer: for the record, most democrats would much rather face cruz than trump so true 









make america great again 

the people of south carolina are embarrassed by nikki haley 
got the endorsement of brian france and @nascar yesterday in georgia. also, many of the sports great drivers. thank you nascar and georgia 




trump university has a 98% approval rating. i could have settled but won't out of principle 








my sons, don and eric, are on @foxandfriends now 7:35. great kids, enjoy 





little marco rubio treated america's ice officers like absolute trash in order to pass obama's amnesty.http://www.breitbart.com/big government/2016/02/19/eve south carolina vote nations ice officers detail marco rubio betrayed/ … 


@emagabi23: rubio was kicking back on his $80k boat he bought with lobbyist money and claimed it was from book sale profit lol 
lightweight senator marco rubio is polling very poorly in florida. the people can't stand him for missing so many votes poor work ethic 
little marco rubio, the lightweight no show senator from florida is just another washington politician.pic.twitter.com/nslrhrqjdx 
mitt romney didn't show his tax return until september 21, 2012, and then only after being humiliated by harry r a bad messenger for estab 
as i stated at the press conference on friday regarding david duke i disavow.pic.twitter.com/oixfkpulz2 
why would the people of texas support ted cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them. he is another all talk, no action pol 

little marco rubio, the lightweight no show senator from florida, is set to be the puppet of the special interest koch brothers. watch 
making a big speech in alabama today. so many people we had to move to a football stadium come and join us 
i am the only republican who will get large numbers of dems and indies (crossover). i will also get states that no other republican can get. 
while hillary and i both won south carolina by big margins, repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles.growing party 
the republican establishment has been pushing for lightweight senator marco rubio to say anything to hit trump.i signed the pledge careful 
while i hear the koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil), word is they have chosen little marco rubio, the lightweight from florida 

@jimmythesaint09: @realdonaldtrump @ronniememo @chrischristie anything is better than @marcorubio 
@fairess369: it is a sad commentary little boy marco rubio can't win in his home state. floridians despise him as a opportunist phony. 

@tiarardis: @foxnews @realdonaldtrump @judgejeanine go trump 
@ronniememo: donaldtrump is a leader. he is a successful person that, like me, isn’t afraid to tell it like it is. governor @chrischristie 



it was an honor to be the grand marshall in the salute to israel parade back in 2004.pic.twitter.com/g7g6hfp0dh 
just watched lightweight marco rubio lying to a small crowd about my past record. he is not as smart as cruz, and may be an even bigger liar 
.#rogerstone was just banned by @cnn their loss tough, loyal guy. 
i started my business with very little and built it into a great company, with some of the best real estate assets in the world. amazing 
i only wish my wonderful father, fred, gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight rubio says. he didn't total fabrication 
fun to watch the democrats working so hard to win the great state of south carolina when i just won the republican version amazing people 
i am self funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight rubio or ted cruz 
tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. after the audit, no problem 
i unfairly get audited by the i.r.s. almost every single year. i have rich friends who never get audited. i wonder why? 

i will be on @foxandfriends at 8:30 a.m. will be talking about lightweight marco rubio and lying ted cruz 
@sassypantsjj: michigan gop poll 2/24/2016 trump 35.5 rubio 15.0 cruz 14.3 kasich 12.8 carson 8.3 @realdonaldtrump wow 


@itsblakec: @realdonaldtrump trump is a genius. rubio and cruz are not. i want a brilliant mind to run this country. 
@donnieboysmith: @realdonaldtrump in contrast to rubio and cruz you look like a giant. they look terribly weak thank you 




they don't like rubio in florida he left them high & dry. doesn't even show up for votes 
lightweight marco rubio was working hard last night. the problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a choker mr. meltdown. 
wow, every poll said i won the debate last night. great honor 
lightweight choker marco rubio looks like a little boy on stage. not presidential material 
lying ted cruz and lightweight choker marco rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. they failed 
will be at fort worth (texas) convention center at 11:30 a.m. big crowd get there early big announcement to be made 
why would the people of florida vote for marco rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their senator and then quit 
have a good chance to win texas on tuesday. cruz is a nasty guy, not one senate endorsement and, despite talk, gets nothing done. loser 
i will be making a speech at 12:00 in fort worth, texas. really big crowd expected. will be talking about the debate last night plus, plus 
@waltseher: @realdonaldtrump @morg25016893 @eventbrite yup 200 polish immigrants were hired by his contractor not trump 
@mjp1370: @realdonaldtrump cruz talks about hillary all the time because he knows he can't beat you trump will win texas 
@donell27743094: @realdonaldtrump trump won the debate. disgusting rubio said peed is he still in junior high school. 
@tdltdltdltdl: marco cruz and ted rubio (easy to get the two politicians confused) looked like desperate, panicked dc insiders tonight 
@skylerdeckard: @realdonaldtrump that's because you've never hired anyone to do work before favorite line from tonights debate. 
@restorereality: tonight you proved to america you are the real deal. you took fire from all sides, stayed composed, returned fire and won 
@slytle24: @davidaxelrod @realdonaldtrump @cnn he won almost all polls and mark halperin gave him an a 

@morg25016893: @eventbrite also, all the things rubio&cruz were using for hits, just petty. trump, clearly the only one w/all the skills. 

all the online polls have me winning the debate. i really enjoyed the evening. not easy, but good.http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot box/presidential races/270873 trump leads post debate online polls … 




failed presidential candidate @mittromney was made to look like a fool by senator harry reid & didn't release his tax returns until 9/21/12. 

fmr pres of mexico, vicente fox horribly used the f word when discussing the wall. he must apologize if i did that there would be a uproar 
early on ted cruz said that if he didn't win south carolina, it's over. he didn't win and lost to me in a landslide 


i'm going to do what @mittromney was totally unable to do win 

signing a recent tax return isn't this ridiculous?pic.twitter.com/udwqf4iziz 
just for your info, tax returns have 0 to do w/ someone’s net worth. i have already filed my financial statements w/ fec. they are great 
why doesn’t @mittromney just endorse @marcorubio already. should have done it before nh or nevada where he had a little sway. too late now 
mitt romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. dope 

@chatteringteef: @borntobegop @realdonaldtrump @mittromney hates to see trump's success when he was so pathetic 
@classyexplorer: @ahernandez85a romney is a pawn of the establishment and has no individual thought process. he is jealous of trump 
@conservativevin: @ahernandez85a romney should have been a tough guy with obama. he cowered and lost. badly he's not relevant 
@stevekwebb: @realdonaldtrump love it @tedcruz is done. we need someone who is proven. @realdonaldtrump will make america great again 

@hosiern: @foxnewspolitics a vote for @tedcruz or @marcorubio is a vote for corruption, special interests and lobbyists. trump for potus 



@gricecindy: that's why we are angry. the republican establishment will not support you. you are who the american people want 
@ddpick18: @realdonaldtrump this texan will be voting trump march 1st. cruz is a fake texan 
.@repchriscollins chris, thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement. i will not let you down @cnn 
when ted cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear, i will get most of his votes no problem 
why would texans vote for liar ted cruz when he was born in canada, lived there for 4 years and remained a canadian citizen until recently 
when mitt romney asked me for my endorsement last time around, he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win 

mitt romney,who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool, is now playing tough guy 
the polls show that i picked up many jeb bush supporters. that is how i got to 46%. when others drop out, i will pick up more. sad but true 

in all of television the only one who said anything bad about last nights landslide victory was dopey @karlrove. he should be fired 


.@usatoday poll and @quinnipiacpoll say that i beat both hillary and bernie, and i havn't even started on them yet 
big defeat last night in nevada for ted cruz and marco rubio. @karlrove on @foxnews is working hard to belittle my victory. rove is sick 
@melaniatrump did great on television this morning. poised, smart and strong, with a big heart so much to offer. we are all proud of you 
melania will be interviewed by @morningmika on @morning_joe now (8:30 a.m.). enjoy 


make sure you get on the trump line and are not mislead by the cruz people. they are bad be careful. 

go vote from now to 8:30 p.m. nevada. i will be at various caucus sites. make america great again 
my wife melania will be on @morning_joe tomorrow morning at 8:00. interviewed by @morningmika enjoy 

club for growth is the group that came to my office seeking $1 million dollars. i told them no and now they are doing negative ads. 
great. just reported on @foxnews that many people who supported @jebbush are now supporting me. i knew that would happen, pundits didn't 
wow, great ohio poll. shows me leading by 5 points, beating k 
unlike the other republican candidates, i will be in nevada all day and night i won't be fleeing, in and out. i love & invest in nevada 

@stevenmeyers11: @vogelsong1 @edrollins @foxnews ed rollins is the only one of those people that understands process & gets it right 
i am growing the republican party tremendously just look at the numbers, way up democrats numbers are significantly down from years past. 
@jojo2foxy: trump is unstoppable....he is what common sense americans want whether republican, independent or a reagan democrat. 
@vogelsong1: @edrollins gets it. was just on @foxnews explaining how trump wins the general election. thank you ed 
ted cruz lifts the bible high into the air and then lies like a dog over and over again the evangelicals in s.c. figured him out & said no 
ted cruz does not have the right temperment to be president. look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. bad 
wow was ted cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. he used him as a scape goat fired like a dog ted panicked. 
ted cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in s.c. he is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration. 


ted cruz said on @oreillyfactor that illegals sent out of country by my administration would come right back as citizens. another lie crazy 
a big fat hit job on @oreillyfactor tonight. a total waste of time to watch, boring and biased. @brithume said i would never run, a dope 
great town hall tonight at 10:00 p.m. (eastern) conducted by @seanhannity on @foxnews 




just watched the very incompetent mitt romney campaign strategist, stuart stevens. now i know why mitt lost so badly. stevens is a clown 


ted cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in iowa. weak rnc and republican leadership probably won't let this happen sad. 
just saw the phony ad by cruz totally false, more dirty tricks. he got caught in so many lies is this man crazy? 
ted cruz has now apologized to marco rubio and ben carson for fraud and dirty tricks. no wonder he has lost evangelical support 
ted cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false no basis in fact. take ad down ted. biggest liar in politics 
wow, ted cruz falsely suggested marco rubio mocked the bible and was just forced to fire his communications director. more dirty tricks 
it is so important to audit the federal reserve, and yet ted cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done. 

many people are now saying i won south carolina because of the last debate. i showed anger and the people of our country are very angry 

@scotmreed: no matter what liar sleazeball @rickwtyler says about @tedcruz in tennessee. we have early voting and @realdonaldtrump has won. 
i hear the rickets family, who own the chicago cubs, are secretly spending $'s against me. they better be careful, they have a lot to hide 
@1sonny12: @ksmith233035 @mitchellvii floridians are upset because rubio did not do what he promised once he was elected vote trump 
@gregusp61: you really rocked them hard in s.c. rubio and cruz were pummled. so glad jeb is gone next no liar 
the reason that ted cruz lost the evangelicals in s.c. is because he is a world class liar, and evangelicals do not like liars 
i am in las vegas, at the best hotel (by far), trump international. i will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to win nevada 

a number of months ago, i was not expected to win south carolina,ted cruz was, and yet i won in a landslide every group and category. win 


a quote was read from a parody account last night on msnbc re: jeb.https://twitter.com/lawrence/status/701261627065294851 … 
the failing @wsj wall street journal should fire both its pollster and its editorial board. seldom has a paper been so wrong.totally biased 
i will be live on all of the major morning talk shows. enjoy 
thank you @sarahpalinusa for your amazing help and support. big win, leaving now for atlanta and nevada.the people of south carolina got it 

what a great night. thank you south carolina, a special place with truly amazing people love 
people (pundits) gave me no chance in south carolina. now it looks like a possible win. i would be happy with a one vote victory (hope) 
@carrollkuykend2: this veteran just voted @realdonaldtrump in the sc primary, let's make america great again 
south carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands. vote now (today), and make america great again 
remember that marco rubio is very weak on illegal immigration. south carolina needs strength as illegals and syrians pour in. don't allow it 
i wonder if president obama would have attended the funeral of justice scalia if it were held in a mosque? very sad that he did not go 
@carolyn82471448: @waynedupreeshow @realdonaldtrump all aboard the trump train 

i am the only candidate (in many years) who is self funding his campaign. lobbyists and $ interests totally control all other candidates 

@birgitolsen1: @realdonaldtrump @justice41ca @vote_for_trump everybody on twitter get out to vote for trump today in south carolina 








@dnmiller2000: @realdonaldtrump i'm a regan dem and believe in your message god bless you and your campaign 
make america great again 
just finished two major speeches in south carolina. big crowds, great people. going for a third now 
boycott all apple products until such time as apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical islamic terrorist couple from cal 
hopefully others will follow suit. our country needs & should demand security. it is time to get tough & be smart 
i use both iphone & samsung. if apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists i'll only be using samsung until they give info. 




i’m self funding and i am going to take care of the people – not the special interests and insurance companies like the other candidates. 
i will replace it with private plans, health savings accounts, & allow purchasing across state lines. maximum choice & freedom for consumer. 
i was referring to a backstop for pre existing conditions. i will eliminate the law, in its entirety, & replace it w/ something much better. 



@kathytravels777: ĺ @andersoncooper tonight on cnn @realdonaldtrump was great. loved the intimacy of conversation w the people 





i agree with marco rubio that ted cruz is a liar 
.@foxnews is changing their theme from fair and balanced to unfair and unbalanced. but dying @wsj is worse.their phony poll is a joke 



new cbs national poll just out massive lead for trump. the wall street journal/nbc poll is a total joke. no wonder wsj is doing so badly 
i love being in south carolina. we are leading big in all of the state polls saturday is a big day. make america great again 
the just out usa today national poll, where i lead by big numbers, shows that in a head to head matchup, i beat both hillary and bernie. 
amazing that while i lead by big numbers in the new q and and usa today polls, the the press only wants to report on the phony wsj/nbc poll. 




jeb bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. he wants to look cool, but it's far too late. 1% in nevada 
just out nevada poll shows jeb bush at 1%, he should take his dumb mouthpiece, @lindseygrahamsc, and just go home. 
.@foxnews is so biased it is disgusting. they do not want trump to win. all negative 
i will beat hillary easily, but lindsey graham says i won't, and yet he got zero against me no cred why does fox put him on? 
.@lindseygraham, who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace saying the most horrible things about me on @foxnews. 
interesting how president obama so haltingly said i would never be president this from perhaps the worst president in u.s. history 


why does @megynkelly devote so much time on her shows to me, almost always negative? without me her ratings would tank. get a life megyn 

thank you @kayleighmcenany for your nice words great knowledge and style we are doing really well in south carolina. @cnn @donlemon 
@good2bqueen67: @brithume @megynkelly they're too lame to get it, sir. when you win the election they'll get it. 
.@brithume thinks that when republicans drop out of the race, someone will pick up all of that vote. the fact is i will get much of it 
explain to @brithume and @megynkelly, who know nothing, that i will beat hillary and win states (and dem indie votes) that no other r can 






new ppp poll just out trump up big, cruz, rubio and bush down. the debate results, even with a stacked rnc audience, were wonderful 
spent the full day at meetings and a major rally yesterday in south carolina. great people and spirit. today will be more of the same. 






i'd like to call jeb a liar, but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used eminent domain when criticizing me (1/2) 
now that george bush is campaigning for jeb( ), is he fair game for questions about world trade center, iraq war and eco collapse? careful 
i will be in south carolina all week. saturday is big, big, big get out and vote make america great again 
jeb bush and ted cruz are not electable presidential candidates, hillary would destroy them. ted may not be eligible to run born in canada 
funny that jeb( ) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.then mommy, now brother 
ted cruz, along with jeb bush, pushed justice john roberts onto the supreme court. roberts could have killed obamacare twice, but didn't 
wow, in the new cbs poll i went way up into the forties thank you 
tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests the bosses 
loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said i won, but the rnc did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. all donors & special ints 

i will be on face the nation with john dickerson on cbs this morning. enjoy 
this shows what a complete & total liar ted cruz is he said he wouldn't have nominated john roberts. really?http://www.nationalreview.com/article/214989/right stuff ted cruz … 
@autumnandews08: @realdonaldtrump @jebbush jeb is incompetent and will lose, don't waste your energy on that cry baby 
even though every poll, time, drudge etc., has me winning the debate by a lot, @foxnews only puts negative people on. biased a total joke 
@jeffpaine: @realdonaldtrump you crushed the debate thank you 



all polls have me winning debate big drudge, time, etc. dopey charles krauthammer still nasty. he has zero cred totally dishonest 

thank you i miss my father.https://twitter.com/eustacefash/status/698735409501757440 … 


ted cruz is a cheater he holds the bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts 
nasty ted cruz is at it again same dirty tricks he used w/ @realbencarson saying i may not be on ballot & i hold liberal positions. lies 
wow honored to be chosen by the highly respected accurate washington & lee mock convention. i hope you are right i will make you proud 
the totally unexpected loss of supreme court justice antonin scalia is a massive setback for the conservative movement and our country 
love the people of south carolina look very much forward to the debate tonight. 

@thtswhtkelsaid: i'm fed up w/ dc playing 3 card monty w/ our tax $'s. it's time we the people play the trump card, & take back our country 





@elvisfan1976: @nrsc stop sending me emails asking me to donate and get a free donaldtrump sticker. i support him and he's self funding 
@dj4k4000: @realdonaldtrump @cnn trump will be our next potus..every american will benefit positivey from this. 
@nellalda: @donaldjtrump45 @realdonaldtrump @reince they are all going crazy we the people do not care at all we are with trump 

a very big thank you to bill donohue, head of the catholic league, for the wonderful interview on @cnn and article in newsmax great insight 

the rnc, which is probably not on my side, just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying trump wants you to contribute to the rnc. 
now an additional 600 700 jobs in america (2,000) being eliminated for move to mexico via hartford courant.pic.twitter.com/boiyqlqgrg 


just got back from tampa. it was an amazing evening with an even more amazing crowd fantastic people will be in south carolina tomorrow. 
word is that little morty zuckerman’s @nydailynews loses more than $50 million per year can that be possible? 
when little morty zuckerman closes his failing @nydailynews will i at least be given some credit? will happen soon. 
11,000 inside venue tonight in tampa broke record set by elton john in 1988 w/out musical instruments another 5,000 outside. will be back 


millions of $'s of false ads, paid for by lobbyists special interests of cheater @sentedcruz and sleepy @jebbush, are now running in s.c. 
@copyover2001: @realdonaldtrump do americans really want a canadian born president? first non native born in history? 
@by @tedcruz good i want to see the court decide what i was always told natural born means born on american soil 

last time lightweight @jebbush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. if he doesn't do better this time, he is out 
if @tedcruz doesn’t clean up his act, stop cheating, & doing negative ads, i have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen. 
lightweight @jebbush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in sc. false advertising desperate and sad 
after hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1m from me, they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect & ill informed ads. 
nothing conservative about the club for growth coming into my office and demanding a $1m contribution, which naturally, they did not get. 

the failing @nydailynews, destroyed by little morty zuckerman, is preparing to close and save face by going online. it's dead 

how can ted cruz be an evangelical christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest? 
lying cruz put out a statement, “trump & rubio are w/obama on gay marriage. cruz is the worst liar, crazy or very dishonest. perhaps all 3? 
weak jeb getting thrown out by management during speech. do you think he will be this tough on putin & others?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oe_lhqzgum … 


cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w/ @realbencarson. how can he preach christian values?http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/donald trump ted cruz south carolina push polls 219158#ixzz3zuaxvw83 … 
@truthinvest: @cnn @tedcruz @realdonaldtrump ted cruz is the definition of sleaze. just ask @realbencarson 

we are getting reports from many voters that the cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest pushpolls on me. we are watching 
jeb failed as jeb he gave up and enlisted mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of iraq). spent $120 million.weak no chance 
he (or she) who hesitates is lost: make america great again 
remember, it was the republican party, with the help of conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, but didn't keep them hi dt 
.@markhalperin showed a focus group on @morning_joe me using a very bad word. i never said the word, left an open blank. please apologize 
jeb bush spent more than $40,000,000 in new hampshire to come in 4 or 5, i spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st. big difference in capability 
there are no buyers for the worthless @nydailynews but little mort zuckerman is frantically looking. it is bleeding red ink a total loser 
i have been consistent in my opposition to common core. get rid of common core keep education local 

@haryder: which is it @realdonaldtrump ?are you planning on getting rid of common core or keeping it? get rid of it fast. 
i was referring to the fact that jeb bush wants to keep common core. 
big speech tonight in south carolina 7:00 p.m. tremendous crowd 
so funny, jeb bush called me a highly gifted politician and a great entertainer i assume that is a compliment 
such a great experience in new hampshire amazing people will be leaving for a big event in south carolina today. 
like the worthless @nydailynews, looks like @politico will be going out of business. bad reporting no money, no cred 
worthless @nydailynews, which dopey mort zuckerman, is desperately trying to sell, has no buyer liabilities are massive 
dopey mort zuckerman, owner of the worthless @nydailynews, has a major inferiority complex. paper will close soon 
@markhalperin: my report card grades for the 2 new hampshire winners: donaldtrump a: v strong energy/close. berniesanders b : went too long 
thank you to the people of new hampshire, i love you now, off to south carolina. 

we will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into new hampshire from our open southern border. we will build a wall and have security. 
we will immediately repeal and replace obamacare and nobody can do that like me. we will save $'s and have much better healthcare 
isis is making big threats today no respect for u.s.a. or our leader if i win it will be a very different story,with very fast results 
new hampshire vote today make america great again 



make america great again 
i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:40. a.m. enjoy 
the polls are now showing that i am the best to win the general election. states that are never in play for repubs will be won by me. great 
no one has done more for people with disabilities than me. i have spent many millions of dollars to help out and am happy to have done so 
i know the governors and jeb bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. his family used private eminent domain 
remember @jebbush wants common core (education from d.c.) and is very weak on illegal immigration ( come as act of love ). not a leader 



now that bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign, he says he would end super pacs. sad 


everybody is laughing at jeb bush spent $100 million and is at bottom of pack. a pathetic figure 


jeb bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a super bowl ad. he is a weak candidate 
my two wonderful sons, don and eric, will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 now enjoy. 
so far the super bowl is very boring not nearly as exciting as politics make america great again 



we are going to have a big event at the verizon wireless arena in manchester, new hampshire 5k join us tomorrow:https://www.eventbrite.com/e/donald j trump in manchester nh tickets 20922675285 …

@realollietaylor: @paintonmy: ia caucus hasn't picked nominee in 16 years cruz dirty tricks stole it. trump way ahead in primary states. 
@paintonmyjeans: if i owned a big company that was failing, i'd hire donaldtrump to make it great again rubio/cruz wouldnt be considered 
@big_carsonrocks: america...stop being duped...wake up cruz & rubio establishment phonies. donaldtrump only truthful & not owned candidate 
@enlighten2881: @ukcatwoman52 @ericnlin @ac360 how come rubio&cruz are going to turn america around but did nothing in the senate for usa? 


@lisabrossman: @ukcatwoman52 @ericnlin @ac360 he is for america security for america jobs for america there is no other leader 
wow, jeb bush, whose campaign is a total disaster, had to bring in mommy to take a slap at me. not nice 

@ukcatwoman52: @ericnlin @ac360 all candidates liars. trump is the only one that speak the truth people need to hear what trump is saying. 

@ericnlin: @ac360 donaldtrump: no raise in 8 years, home not worth what i paid for it, healthcare is a joke obama is a liar. trump 2016

10,000 people in south carolina, unbelievable evening will be in new hampshire tomorrow love it.pic.twitter.com/tf033yjhu3 
really dumb @cherijacobus. begged my people for a job. turned her down twice and she went hostile. major loser, zero credibility 

@maryann1942: @realdonaldtrump why vote for trump? unlike politicians all talk, trump’s talk materializes he will make america great again 



i very much look forward to tomorrow’s debate in new hampshire—so many things to say, so much at stake. it will be an incredible evening 

big storm in new hampshire. moved my event to monday. will be there next four days. 

@rkswaney7: @cnn @realdonaldtrump i agree. great businessman. i like your tone tonight keep it up & you'll have this democrats vote. 
watch @ac360 on now @cnn 
i will be interviewed by anderson cooper at 8pm on @cnn from new hampshire. should be very interesting 


this is the cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone, a misdemeanor at minimum.pic.twitter.com/tmav17ugkf 
.@oreillyfactor @karlrove as per the show, an even more serious cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone. 

thank you @billoreilly & @karlrove. ted cruz should be immediately disqualified in iowa, with each candidate moving up one notch. 
sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me. he would be so easy to beat 



dr. ben carson blasted ted cruz for deceit and dirty tricks and lies. 

the state of iowa should disqualify ted cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated a total fraud 

i will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 p.m. enjoy @foxnews 
based on the fraud committed by senator ted cruz during the iowa caucus, either a new election should take place or cruz results nullified. 
and finally, cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that trump was strongly in favor of obamacare and choice a total lie 
the voter violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of f) and told them to clear it up by voting for cruz. fraud 
many people voted for cruz over carson because of this cruz fraud. also, cruz sent out a voter violation certificate to thousands of voters. 
during primetime of the iowa caucus, cruz put out a release that @realbencarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for cruz. 
ted cruz didn't win iowa, he stole it. that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. bad 
great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany @cherijacobus begged us for a job. we said no and she went hostile. a real dummy @cnn 

anybody who watched all of ted cruz's far too long, rambling, overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his howard dean moment 
@stephbewitching @realdonaldtrump all you haters need to realize trump got the second highest vote in history. and he's never held office 

@ellenespence @realdonaldtrump amazing job in iowa cruz just barely won. 
@93101dianne @realdonaldtrump if you can do that well in iowa then i see you acing it in all other significant states. momentum is growing 
@lorewestphal @realdonaldtrump you must win the presidency in 2016 
.@morning_joe @mikebarnicle on @realdonaldtrump: he finished 2nd but he made the turn successfully like a pro 
i don't believe i have been given any credit by the voters for self funding my campaign, the only one. i will keep doing, but not worth it 
i will be talking about my wonderful experience in iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media later in new hampshire. big crowd 
the media has not covered my long shot great finish in iowa fairly. brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history 
because i was told i could not do well in iowa, i spent very little there a fraction of cruz & rubio. came in a strong second. great honor 
my experience in iowa was a great one. i started out with all of the experts saying i couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. nice 
it all begins today we will finally take our country back and make america great again 





i will be interviewed on face the nation with @jdickerson this morning. enjoy 
i am in iowa. will be interviewed on this week with @gstephanopoulos this morning. enjoy 
if i would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). also, vets got $6,000,000. 
by not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, i was able to make the point of not allowing unfairness while raising $6,000,000 for vets. 
wow, just saw an ad cruz is lying on so many levels. there is nobody more against obamacare than me, will repeal & replace. he lies 
ted cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important financial disclosure form. very low interest loans, scam 
ted cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in canada). will loose big to hillary. polls show i beat hillary easily win 
i will be going to church in iowa this morning with my wife, melania. after church i will be making two speeches and touring the state 
.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man. when i wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more, he endorsed cruz. @foxandfriends 
.@bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event. the people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100,000 for himself.phony @foxandfriends 
.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. asked me for expensive hotel rooms, free (and more). i said pay and he endorsed cruz 
the cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters in violation. they are now under investigation. bad 



i will be in iowa all day and until tuesday morning. finally, after all these years of watching stupidity, we will make america great again 
hillary clinton is a major national security risk. not presidential material 

@gigglemitz: @geraldorivera @foxnews damn fox is really acting like a baby today. i guess trump got under their skin pretty biased 
@classyexplorer: @oreillyfactor @drudge so bill if america was so longing to learn more about candidates why the 50 percent audience loss? 

.@oreillyfactor the people of iowa love the fact that i stuck up for my rights, as i will do for the u.s. also got $6,000,000 for our vets 
.@foxnews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6,000,000 raised in one hour for our vets. 
amazing that ted cruz can't even get a senator like @bensasse, who is easy, to endorse him. not one senator is endorsing canada ted 
.@bensasse looks more like a gym rat than a u.s. senator. how the hell did he ever get elected? @greta 
the great state of nebraska can do much better than @bensasse as your senator. saw him on @greta totally ineffective. wants paid for pols. 
the new e mail release is a disaster for hillary clinton. at a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president? 

they say that if i participated in last night’s fox debate, they would have had 12 million more & would have broken the all time record. 




thank you mitchell fox2 michigan poll finds trump holds 3 1 lead over closest gop opponents. trump 47% clinton 43%pic.twitter.com/xpaev0yzgv

iowa was amazing last night. the event could not have worked out better. we raised $6,000,000 for our great vets. they were so happy & proud 





thank you for the kind words tonight, @omarosa. you were great see you soon 


watching biased charles @krauthammer, a @foxnews flunky who didn't know that i won every debate, in particular the last one. check polls 


i hear that @sentedcruz’s $$ man, robert mercer, a good man, is very angry because cruz lied to him about liquidating his (ted’s) holdings.?

@chgardens1: @mitchellvii pathetic attempt to bribe @realdonaldtrump he can't be bought 
the debate tonight will be a total disaster low ratings with advertisers and advertising rates dropping like a rock. i hate to see this. 
@laurencristmann: @realdonaldtrump why do they have so many debates this year?? also, why is cruz still allowed to run, he's not eligible 
@hollywoodjv: @realdonaldtrump mr. trump, why does cruz hate canada so much. he should embrace his roots, it's a great country so true 
wow, two candidates called last night and said they want to go to my event tonight at drake university. 

@rick_gobbi: @realdonaldtrump ...hold up a mirror so the network cameras show how big the crowd is. great idea 
@plazzmatic: @realdonaldtrump @danpgabriel sounds like the advertisers want trump, he knows what he is doing. 

@dukeofbc: @megynkelly debate cruz one on one. i would just tell him that you were to busy running for the president of usa, not canada 
@cjcboi: @drjamescabot @realdonaldtrump @danscavino @carolde @playstrumpcard checked your wallet lately, mr ailes? 

@davejager1: @creta_r 9 pm channel 70 cnn i will be watching trump tonight. want to have a person in the white house that takes no bs. 
@henryoray: @cnnpolitics @tedcruz @realdonaldtrump is fighting corruption. big donors took over cruz. no to donors 

@splashpoint50: @realdonaldtrump our retrumplican trump support group of 9500 members say 97% will not watch the debate tonight 
@creta_r: @realdonaldtrump looking forward to watching donald trump rally thursday night on cnn 

on greta, 87% of the people said they would not watch the debate if i'm not in it. wow what an honor 
fox debate advertising rates falling like a rock tune into my special event for the veterans at 9pm est 

it was the childishly written & taunting pr statement by fox that made me not do the debate, more so than lightweight reporter, @megynkelly. 
i will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 p.m. (eastern). enjoy 

even though i beat him in the first six debates, especially the last one, ted cruz wants to debate me again. can we do it in canada? 
just got to listen to rush limbaugh the guy is fantastic 
the statement put out yesterday by @foxnews was a disgrace to good broadcasting and journalism. who would ever say something so nasty & dumb 
i refuse to call megyn kelly a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct. instead i will only call her a lightweight reporter 







do you think @sentedcruz knows about @bobvanderplaats dealings? actually, i doubt it 

.@bobvanderplaats begged me to do an event while asking organizers for $100,000 for himself—a bad guy 
great honor rev. jerry falwell jr. of liberty university, one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation, has just endorsed me 


why doesn't phony @bobvanderplaats tell his followers all the times he asked for him and his family to stay at my hotels didn't like paying 

@puttster71: @bobvanderplaats the next president isn't on ur stage. @realdonaldtrump is the next president. 
@aynsfriend: @bobvanderplaats cruz is done @cnn @chriscuomo 
@xxflame: .@bobvanderplaats idiot bob plaats on cnn is deluded cruz's favorability ratings are 0%, no one likes him. vote trump instead 


i will be interviewed by @mariabartiromo on @morningsmaria @foxbusiness at 7:30 a.m. enjoy. 
@laurencristmann: @sharp_trident @megynkelly it makes me not wanna watch debate because i know they are going to treat trump unfair 
i will be doing @gma @gstephanopoulos this morning at around 7:00. likewise, i will be doing @morning_joe at around 7:00. figure it out 
@sharp_trident: a huge disappointment to see @megynkelly constantly attack donaldtrump. it has become almost unbearable to watch her show. 
@whitejacketpink: @mypresidentme @realdonaldtrump just google glenn beck bio. u can tell no education, very poorly written. 
@dittopost: @realdonaldtrump @crusade4honesty @borntobegop @megynkelly i believe in trump 
@crusade4honesty: @borntobegop @megynkelly megan can not contain her bias, it's in every show, fox owners saudi prince agnstt 
@jackburtonreflx: @jdenino1 @davidwohl @ss i listen to glenn beck and literally nothing he says makes any sense. same with the view. 
@belizediver88: @cnnsitroom @cnn @megynkelly it will never happen. fox will drop kelly if it means no trump. nobody will watch w/o trump. 
@kurtschlichter: my pal @davidwohl was just on megan kelly's show he digs trump. thank you david, you were great

heading to sioux county, iowa, where the crowd is amazing. dr. robert jeffress will make the introduction. make america great again 
ted cruz poll numbers are down big. because he was born in canada and was, until recently, a canadian citizen, many believe he cannot run 
i am in iowa watching all of these phony t.v. ads by the other candidates. all bull, politicians are all talk and no action it won't happen 
.@anncoulter has been amazing. we will win and establish strong borders, we will build a wall and mexico will pay. we will be great again 

@noamscheiber: dow down almost 2000 pts since start of year, but still outperforming wall street's investment in jeb. jeb wants common core 

i am in iowa. will be making two speeches today. good luck to all of the great folks on the east coast. enjoy the beauty of the storm 


is cruz honest? he is in bed w/ wall st. & is funded by goldman sachs/citi, low interest loans. no legal disclosure & never sold off assets. 

cruz says i supported tarp, which gave $25 million to goldman sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. puppet 
the only reason irrelevant @glennbeck doesn't like me is i refused to do his failing show asked many times. very few listeners sad 
.@brentbozell, one of the national review lightweights, came to my office begging for money like a dog. why doesn't he say that? 
just watched jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. jeb mom can't help you with isis, the chinese or with putin. 
ted cruz went down big in just released reuters poll what's going on? is it goldman sachs/citi loans or canada? 

the tax scam washington post does among the most inaccurate stories of all. really dishonest reporting. 

wow new national zogby poll just out:.trump 45. cruz 13. rubio 8. big numbers. 
leaving nevada now for iowa. things are looking good great new polls 



the dying @nro national review has totally given up the fight against barrack obama. they have been losing for years. i will beat hillary 


@lisa_milicaj: truth be told, i never heard of the national review until they tried to declare war on you. no worries, you got my vote 
after spending $89 million, @jebbush is at the bottom of the barrel in polls. he is ashamed to use the name bush in ads. low energy guy 
the failing @nro national review magazine has just been informed by the republican national committee that they cannot participate in debate 



highly respected constitutional law professor mary brigid mcmanamon has just stated, ted cruz is not eligible to be president. big problem 




@realollietaylor: isn't it time we had a president? let goofy glen keep canada cruz who can't win. the american people have trump 
ted cruz complains about my views on eminent domain, but without it we wouldn't have roads, highways, airports, schools or even pipelines. 
the late, great, william f. buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize, the dying national review 
very few people read the national review because it only knows how to criticize, but not how to lead. 
national review is a failing publication that has lost it's way. it's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. sad 

why does @greta have a fired bushy like dummy, john sununu on spewing false info? i will beat hillary by a lot, she wants no part of trump. 




happy birthday to my friend, the great @jacknicklaus a totally special guy 
new day on cnn treats me very badly. @alisyncamerota is a disaster. not going to watch anymore. 
low energy candidate @jebbush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign. millions spent on me. he should go home and relax 
sad sack @jebbush has just done another ad on me, with special interest money, saying i won't beat hillary i will. but he can't beat me. 
so sad that @cnn and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in oklahoma. dishonest reporting 
@americanaspie: @glennbeck @sarahpalinusa remember when glenn gave out gifts to illegal aliens at crossing the border? me too 



wacko @glennbeck is a sad answer to the @sarahpalinusa endorsement that cruz so desperately wanted. glenn is a failing, crying, lost soul

“palin’s brand among evangelicals is as gold as the faucets in trump tower,” said ralph reed, the chairman of the faith & freedom coalition. 
wow, the highly respected governor of iowa just stated that ted cruz must be defeated. big shoker people do not like ted. 

in the just released sc poll i increased my lead by 4 points since last poll by same firm. up by 14 cruz dropped 3.http://www.thestate.com/news/politics government/politics columns blogs/the buzz/article55176940.html …

.@freejessejames just read your complete statement. you are an amazing guy & i really appreciate your words & support. i will see you soon 

really disgusting that the failing new york times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories. 
dope frank bruni said i called many people, including karl rove, losers true i never called my friend @howardstern a loser he’s a winner 

wow, new polls just out have trump up and cruz down he is a nervous wreck 
.@thebrodyfile great job on @ac360. thank you for the very smart and kind words 

i don't think ted cruz can even run for president until he can assure republican voters that being born in canada is not a problem. doubt 
ted cruz is falling in the polls. he is nervous. people are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks 





thank you @ivankatrump for the kind words. i am very proud of the role model you are for so many. nh & ia radio ad:https://youtu.be/bogd9mvzii4  
@pbralick: @benkissel great on @greggutfeld @greggutfeldshow @jonosuchinsky too thank you ben for your nice comments on debate 
i am self funding my campaign putting up my own money, not controlled. cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his n.y. bosses. 
far more killed than anticipated in radical islamic terror attack yesterday. get tough and smart u.s., or we won't have a country anymore 

iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from u.s., rather airbus 
in iran deal we get 4 prisoners. they get $150 billion, 7 most wanted and many off watch list. this will create great incentive for others 
interesting read from peggy noonan.pic.twitter.com/jaxiy8xsem 
is this the new york that ted cruz is talking about & demeaning?pic.twitter.com/rygx9vazku 
wow ted cruz received $487k in campaign contributions, $11m from a ny hedge fund mogul, & $1m low int. loan from goldman sachs. hypocrite 

greatly dishonest of @tedcruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks then pretend he is going to clean up wall st 
when will @tedcruz give all the new york based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him. 
everybody that loves the people of new york, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like ted cruz out of politics 
if ted cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage? 
ted is the ultimate hypocrite. says one thing for money, does another for votes.http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/politics/at new york reception ted cruz is said to strike different tone toward gays.html?referer= … 

ted cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. they own him 
based on the fact that ted cruz was born in canada and is therefore a natural born canadian, did he borrow unreported loans from c banks? 
oh no, just reported that ted cruz didn't report another loan, this one from citi. wow, no wonder banks do so well in the u.s. senate. 
the ted cruz wiseguy apology to the people of new york is a disgrace. remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there 
was there another loan that ted cruz forgot to file. goldman sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. not much of a reformer 
ted cruz said he didn't know that he was a canadian citizen. he also forgot to file his goldman sachs million $ loan papers.not believable 
ted cruz was born in canada and was a canadian citizen until 15 months ago. lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. i told you so 
more radical islam attacks today it never ends strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. no more being politically correct. 
.@frankluntz is a total clown. has zero credibility @foxnews @megynkelly 
.@oreillyfactor please explain to the very dumb and failing @glennbeck that i supported john mccain big league in 2008, not obama 
just got back from iowa had a great time with amazing people. will be back soon 
.@geraldorivera thank you geraldo for your nice words on @oreillyfactor tonight. you are a true champion thank @ericbolling great guy 
@geraldorivera @sentedcruz got ass kicked by @realdonaldtrump last night he offended every new yorker & has no answer to natural born issue 


sen. lindsey graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for president and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of bush. 
jeb bush, who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero, just got graham endorsement. graham quit at o. 


@ameriflames: @realdonaldtrump @clewandowski_ no one wants a bush or a clinton, they want a straight shooter like trump 


do you think iran would have acted so tough if they were russian sailors? our country was humiliated. 

@melindaross123: @foxnews @realdonaldtrump there isn't anything donald trump says that i don't agree with. go trump 

united states looks more and more like a paper tiger. won't be that way if i win 
iran humiliated the united states with the capture of our 10 sailors. horrible pictures & images. we are weak. i will not forget 
stuart stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches. romney campaign,his book,etc. why does @andersoncooper put him on? 
why does @cnn & @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist, stuart stevens who lost big for romney on the show? 





sadly, there is no way that ted cruz can continue running in the republican primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. dems will sue 
@johnkurkosky: @carolde @the_lady_colors @drjamescabot @tamidurling @aceofspadeshq this election is about americas future, vote trump 

iran toys with u.s. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. don't release money. we want our hostages back now 
numerous polls have me beating hillary clinton. in a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in u.s. history i get most new voters 
the state of the union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non substantive i have heard in a long time. new leadership fast 
just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on iowa push polls negative to me. not nice, but ok new polls are great. 




such a serious problem for ted & the gop. great doubt, dems will sue let's all work together to solve this problem.https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/01/11/through ted cruz constitutional looking glass/zvke6qpf31q2rsvpo9ngok/story.html …

.@majorcbs major garrett of @cbsnews covers me very inaccurately. total agenda, bad reporter 
thank you michael harrison @talkersmagazine for your kind words greatly appreciated 

.@megynkelly recently said that she can’t be wooed by trump. she is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her 

.@ringlingbros is retiring their elephants the circus will never be the same. 
congratulations to @jdickerson of face the nation on his highest ratings in 15 years. 4.6 million people watched my interview thank you 

so professional of @abc news to throw out the failing @unionleader newspaper from their debate. paper won't survive, highly unethical 
great job on fox this morning @katiepavlich. i am sending out for your book immediately. thank you very much 

why does @thisweekabc w/ @gstephanopoulos allow a hater & racist like @tavissmiley to waste good airtime? @abc can do much better than him 

union leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the abc news debate like a dog. for starters, try getting a new publisher 
ul has lost all credibility under joe mcquaid w circulation dropping to record lows. they aren't worthy of representing the great people nh. 
this is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. i said it should not be allowed and abc agreed. 
if their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn’t questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can’t win. 
i am pleased to announce that i had the union leader removed from the upcoming debate.http://www.politico.com/blogs/on media/2016/01/abc severs debate partnership with union leader 217560 … 
remember, get time magazine i am on the cover. take it out in 4 years and read it again just watch... 
heading now for reno, nevada, for a big rally. good poll numberd all over 
in the just out @foxnews poll, i easily beat hillary clinton and i havn't even focused on her yet. on our way: make america great again 
yesterday in iowa was amazing two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. they love that i am the only candidate self funding 

i want to thank the people of iowa for an unbelievable day. the crowds were amazing. will be back tuesday 
will be on meet the press with @chucktodd tomorrow morning. enjoy 
i will be interviewed by chris wallace on fox tomorrow morning. tune in 
i'm protesting the @unionleader from having anything to do w/ abc debate. their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved 

(1/2) time magazine has me on the cover this week. david von drehle has written one of the best stories i have ever had. 

.@jonahnro, watched on @seanhannity and appreciate your statements i have been waiting for them for a long time. thank you. 
thank you, @thefix chris cillizza. it is a true person of character that can change his opinion & do what is right.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the fix/wp/2016/01/09/still dont think donald trump can win this chart should convince you/ … 

south carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun). i am now off to iowa for two big rallies packed houses. love it 
pat buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @cnn way to go pat, way ahead of your time 
great even in sc tonight fire marshall would not let everyone in 5,000 turned away. thank you for coming 
will be at venue, in wonderful south carolina, very soon. big traffic back up, tremendous crowd will be wild. 



i hope all workers demand that their @teamsters reps endorse donald j. trump. nobody knows jobs like i do don’t let them sell you out 
on my way to south carolina. big crowd look forward to it 
not good news for jeb bushhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeb bush liked republicans_568fba2be4b0c8beacf694f4 … 
hank greenberg, formerly of aig, gave $10 million to the @jebbush campaign 3 months ago. he is not happy, a total waste of money 
@rlbenney: @realdonaldtrump you did great and showed courage going to burlington. no other gop candidate would do what you did tonight 
@pink_sprnva: @pastormike7 @thehill i agree with you on this. @realdonaldtrump won't be good. he will be great 

@hofmannken: donaldtrump, wish i could attend one of your rallies, none are close enough. make america great again for my kids.thank you 
great time in burlington, vermont. crowd was amazing. 

i'm leaving now for burlington, vermont. it will be wild 
joy behar, who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings, is even worse on @theview. we love barbara 
the @theview @abc, once great when headed by @barbarajwalters, is now in total freefall. whoopi goldberg is terrible. very sad 

weak & ineffective @jebbush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. false advertising 
i have an idea for @jebbush whose campaign is a disaster. try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it 
.@sentedcruz ted free legal advice on how to pre empt the dems on citizen issue. go to court now & seek declaratory judgment you will win 
massive crowd in vt tonight. venue not big enough. officials say no to outside event and sound system. arrive early 
man shot inside paris police station. just announced that terror threat is at highest level. germany is a total mess big crime. get smart 
i will be in beautiful burlington, vermont, tonight for a rally. will be great fun. make america great again 
it was a very wise move that ted cruz renounced his canadian citizenship 18 months ago. senator john mccain is certainly no friend of ted 
.@macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the s&p last year, plunging 46%. very disloyal company. another win for trump boycott. 
the failing @unionleader newspaper in n.h. just sent the trump organization a letter asking that we take ads. how stupid, how desperate 

i will be on @wolfblitzer for a @cnnsitroom interview today. please join us 5pm et. 
huge crowd expected tomorrow night vt police say first come, first serve. arrive early 
don’t like @samuelljackson’s golf swing. not athletic. i’ve won many club championships. play him for charity 
i don’t cheat at golf but @samuelljackson cheats—with his game he has no choice—and stop doing commercials 

germany is going through massive attacks to its people by the migrants allowed to enter the country. new years eve was a disaster. think 
@becker_berta: @longtalltexan20 trump single handedly did what no other politician ever dared to do, attacked the media for all their lies 
@arkaysdesign: @slone @realdonaldtrump have to get people of all ages out to vote for donald trump 
@compresphyllis: @seanhannity @foxnews i am so glad u are for trump your program is my favorite. the don is by far the best 
@kacee50: @realdonaldtrump women make up the fastest growing market in gun sales. and hillary wants to take those rights away from women 
@kristopheryan11: @realdonaldtrump mr trump you were excellent on @seanhannity tonight thank you 

@boazziz: . @danscavino somewhere in that crowd am i. the gymnasium was electric, the crowd unstoppable & @realdonaldtrump kingly. 
@rubinsteinnel: @realdonaldtrump @pearl_brendan @dphilbs if trump doesn't win, we may not be able to recuperate america. 
@trumpy17: @realdonaldtrump gave an awesome speech in claremont tonight 


@longtalltexan20 @realdonaldtrump i love it when trump calls out msm for what they really are cams starting to show crowds at rallies 
@lucky5713 @newday what's wrong with showing morocco? nothing it illustrates a point duh love the video 
i don’t know @samuelljackson, to best of my knowledge haven't played golf w/him & think he does too many tv commercials—boring. not a fan. 
wow @unionleader circulation in nh has dropped from 75,000 to around 10—bad management. no wonder they begged me for ads. 
@lilredfrmkokomo: @realdonaldtrump my facebook groups are all voting trump /4000 people great 
@marybnall01: @realdonaldtrump watched lowell mass speech. awesome. great crowd. make america great again 

@iloveidevices: @edwinro47796972 @happyjack225 @foxnews @krauthammer minimizing dependency on china is crucial.only trump talks about that 
@salriccobono: @realdonaldtrump @troyconway donald get big business back and# make america great again for 2016 

@mark98z: @realdonaldtrump mr. trump this was your best, most energized one to date. ( and i have watched most of them)... well done 
@samuelghaddad: wow let's hear it for the factor. let the truth be known. more are beginning to realize @realdonaldtrump is the real deal 
@thecybermenace: @realdonaldtrump donald trump hit one out of the ballpark in lowell, ma tonight 

the rally in lowell, massachusetts, was amazing. 10,000 people going wild. make america great again 
woody johnson, owner of the nyjets, is @jebbush’s finance chairman. if woody would’ve been w/me, he would’ve been in the playoffs, at least 
i look forward to being in lowell, massachusetts, today. i hear a very big crowd is expected we will have lots of fun 
@rhettriley1234: trump only wins with our votes. we must grow trump nation and do our part. vote. this is our time. 

by the way, hillary & the msm forgot to mention that hillary is in the al shabaab terror video.http://therightscoop.com/media gleefully reporting al shabab video with trump ignores hillary and black lives matter are in it too/ … 
the worst thing hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. just watch. 
iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by obama, has wanted a way to take over saudi arabia & their oil. they just found it 
@barbaraslavin1: @ruthmarcus @washingtonpost bashing distinguished women journalists won't win you votes she is 3rd rate, a total dummy 
@tinahillstrom1: @foxnews @katrinapierson i love @piersmorgan & @realdonaldtrump real men w/ an opinion exciting interesting controversial 
.@ruthmarcus of the @washingtonpost was terrible today on face the nation.no focus, poor level of concentration but correct on hillary lying 
.@chucktodd said today on @meetthepress that attacking bill to get to hillary has never worked before. wrong attacked him in '08 & won 
does anybody remember when bill clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for hillary? she lost now bill is at it again. just watch. 

hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. if she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm 
al shabbab, not isis, just made a video on me they all will as front runner & if i speak out against them, which i must. hillary lied 
hillary clinton lied last week when she said isis made a d.t. video. the video that isis made was about her husband being a degenerate. 
just returned from mississippi a great evening. 




just arrived in mississippi for the rally. word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive. will be an amazing evening 

remember, i am self funding my campaign, the only one in either party. i'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests only the u.s.a. 
when i look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware the candidates are mere puppets $$$$ 
i hope bill clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how hillary abused those women 
hillary clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. jeb bush is a low energy individual, but hillary is not much better 
hillary clinton said that it is o.k. to ban muslims from israel by building a wall, but not o.k. to do so in the u.s. we must be vigilant 
.@jebbush is a low energy stiff who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. has no chance 
.@jebbush is a sad case. a total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on trump hit ads 



the person that hillary clinton least wants to run against is, by far, me. it will be the largest voter turnout ever she will be swamped 

i will be going to mississippi tomorrow night hear the crowds are going to be massive look forward to it. 
@casuperrunner: @georgehenryw huckabee is a good man...but he needs to get behind @realdonaldtrump i agree 
@memeoryhead: i'm one of your biggest fans mr trump and i can't wait for you to make america great ifagain never forget you have support 
@jodil792: we are standing with you spreading the word...trump for president 2016 i wake & sleep praying for you & the usa israel2 
@marie7777777777: @realdonaldtrump we love u to trump family. god bless you. 
well, the year has officially begun. i have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around 
@sprinklermanus: @cnn @realdonaldtrump they're spending millions but you're still going to win go donald trump 
@jallenaip: hillary said she was in a fog of war as explanation for the lies about benghazi. no fog allowed in wh. vote trump potus 



i will be on @foxnews live, with members of my family, at 11:50 p.m. we will ring in the new year together make america great again 
i would like to wish everyone a happy and healthy new year. we must all work together to, finally, make america safe again and great again 
do you believe that the state department, on new year's eve, just released more of hillary's e mails. they just want it all to end. bad 


i would feel sorry for @jebbush and how badly he is doing with his campaign other than for the fact he took millions of $'s of hit ads on me 


@deggow: just heard a 25 year old man say i would rather work for donald trump than bernie sanders it's time for me to leave this party. 


@sensanders: i have a message for donald trump: no, we’re not going to hate latinos, we’re not going to hate muslims. i fully agree 


people ask, why do you tweet and re tweet to millions about @jebbush when he is so low in the polls? because of his big $ hit ads on me 
@ddpick18: @realdonaldtrump @jebbush @hughhewitt i get pissed off every time i see his ads on fox. waste of money go trump many do 
@nikkisue69: @realdonaldtrump @jebbush @hughhewitt jeb is such a lightweight 
@luciano031982: @realdonaldtrump veterans love trump but i love the vets even more 

.@jebbush has spent $63,000,000 and is at the bottom of the polls. i have spent almost nothing and am at the top. win @hughhewitt 

a great day in south carolina. record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm. this is now a movement to make america great again 
i predict that dying @unionleader newspaper, which has been run into the ground by publisher stinky joe mcquaid, will be dead in 2 years 


i'm going to be live with @ericbolling and @kimguilfoyle to ring in the new year 2016. everybody should tune in to @foxnews tomorrow night 


i never thought i'd be saying this but i've really enjoyed @richlowry on television lately, and he was terrific hosting @seanhannity 
joe mcquaid (@deucecrew) is desperately trying to sell the @unionleader. it's a loser, and my comments haven't helped him much. 
the dying @unionleader newspaper in nh is in turmoil over my comments about them like a bully that got knocked out 

@bfb123456: @trumpiowa @playstrumpcard @realdonaldtrump wow fantastic . who knew americans were so smart? great to know we're so smart 
@hammetjohn: donaldtrump how do u do it donald. no one could keep up with u at your pace. shows how hard u will work for us as president 
@videosigninc: @realdonaldtrump keep the momentum going mr. trump. all the best to you for the new year. make america great again thanks 

iowa was fantastic last night, amazing crowd and people. i'm now in florida, getting ready to go to south carolina. big crowd, very exciting 
.@charleshurt you were great on @seanhannity last night. thanks for the nice words. make america great again 

joe mcquaid (@deucecrew) of the dying union leader wanted ads, lunches, donations, speeches from me, and tweets very unethical. 
the great people of new hampshire, who i love, are not properly served by the dying union leader newspaper. 
shows how dumb joe mcquaid (@deucecrew) of the dying union leader is to put out the letter i wrote saying why i didn't do his failed debate 




so, i have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. jeb bush has spent $59 million & done. run country my way 
my campaign for president is $35,000,000 under budget, i have spent very little (and am in 1st place).now i will spend big in iowa/n.h./s.c. 

i will be interviewed on the @todayshow at 7:00 a.m. talking about the state of the race for president, and more. enjoy 
@billatlantaga: @realdonaldtrump @russgrand @jebbush agreed. you destroyed him with only $250k 43% 
@landmanmarius: @realdonaldtrump @russgrand @jebbush word on street is that @jebbush mother is voting @realdonaldtrump so cute 
.@jessebwatters is terrific at hosting on @foxnews he really gets it 
@russgrand: @jebbush we had your brother and father who were a disaster in office..do us a favor and drop out in favor of @realdonaldtrump 
remember that bill clinton was brought in to help hillary against obama in 2008. he was terrible, failed badly, and was called a racist 

@leemiracle3: @foxnews @charleshurt @realdonaldtrump trump listening to voters, unlike gop 

@ijnipgm: no casualties. just victory, victory, and more victory as you proclaim the truth that is in your heart. we love god and usa 






strange, but i see wacko bernie sanders allies coming over to me because i'm lowering taxes, while he will double & triple them, a disaster 
wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few, and people have lost faith in our leaders.we need smart and strong leadership now 
many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. we now are part time, sad i will fix 
the middle class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of and no effective raise in years. bad 
if hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong 
@borntobegop: @realdonaldtrump we need a real president to get things done, and that's why we want you thank you. 
hopefully the republican national committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in virginia's republican party. fast 
straighten out the republican party of virginia before it is too late. stupid rnc 

@isabellegirlxo: @realdonaldtrump @jebbush @ananavarro @secupp @cnn ana is an illegal who needs to be deported no, she's just incompetent 
.@berniesanders who blew his campaign when he gave hillary a pass on her e mail crime, said that i feel wages in america are too high. lie 
@davidsadler2525: @realdonaldtrump what's going on in va? what's the gop doing? they will lose the state because of the rnc 
why are @jebbush flunkies @ananavarro and @secupp, two of the dumbest people in politics, always on the @cnn panels..and yet poll:trump 39 
the voters the republican party of virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. the dems love it be smart and win for a change 
r.p.virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. will now not allow desperately needed new voters. suicidal mistake. rnc must act now 
it begins, republican party of virginia, controlled by the rnc, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. bad 
@legacyrealtorsj: you will come out tops mr trump. you are sincere, genuine, hard working, honest and willl do what you promise the people 
@jimvitari: @realdonaldtrump @cac8438 we need the change trump is going to make, not the change obama did by ruining the country 
@cac8438: he supports amnesty and now they are so desperate that trey gowdy is going to campaign with him. 
@mitchellvii: my prediction on the trey gowdy endorsement of rubio is that it will do nothing for rubio and finish gowdy. 
@mitchellvii: face it, trey gowdy failed miserably on benghazi. he allowed it to drag out and in the end, let hillary get away with murder. 

i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00. will be talking about hillary and far more interesting subjects. enjoy 
i will do far more for women than hillary, and i will keep our country safe, something which she will not be able to do no strength/stamina 

hillary clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but he's demonstrated a penchant for sexism, so inappropriate 
@greta: if the insurance companies are making lots of money and the # of uninsured is still large,obamacare is a failure since so expensive 
a new terror warning was issued for european cties. at what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. weak leaders 

criminal deportations in the u.s. are the lowest number in many years. we are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. must change 
the phoenix v.a., it has just been reported, is in worse shape than ever before. the wait is horrendous, and people are dying. i will fix it 
the same people that said i wouldn't run, or that i wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say i won't beat hillary. 
.@chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until i came along no ratings. i will beat hillary 


@jodil792: you know what's making my christmas great, family/food/friends&you i have my trump shirt on w/hope in my heart for america 
@jacobsac2015: @foxnews thank you for your tweet today on christmas. can't wait to see you as president, mr. trump. you are awesome. 

when will the democrats, and hillary in particular, say we must build a wall, a great wall, and mexico is going to pay for it? never 
our great veterans are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the v.a. that will stop, i will fix this quickly 
remember when failed candidate @jebbush said that illegals came across the border as an act of love? he's spent $59 million and is at 3%. 
we have many problems in our house (country ), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. make america great again 
does everyone see that the democrats and president obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. politics 
.@deedeesorvino was great today on @foxnews she gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly. have her on more 
merry christmas to all. have a great day and have a really amazing year. together, we will make america great again it will be done 
.@danielhalper great job on @cnn today. very wise indeed 
.@halliejackson why didn't you report hillary lying about the isis video. bad reporting. perhaps @nbc will do better next year but doubt it 
@yesmrgilbert: @nbcnightlynews @halliejackson should have talked to megyn kelly about this story true, a total distortion of the facts 
i am now in palm beach, florida, and will be going to church tonight. make america great again 
.@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @cnn poll where i am at 39%, 21points higher than cruz. be honest chuck 
why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @cnn poll when discussing how well i am doing instead of the older q poll? cnn even better 
wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ice to launch large scale deportation raids. it's about time 
next year will be an interesting one. i look forward to running against hillary clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly 
third rate reporters amy chozick and maggie haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the hillary circle of bias. think about bill 
wow, even lowly rand paul has just past @jebbush in the new @cnn poll. jeb is at 3%, i'm at 39%. stop throwing your money down the drain 
in the ridiculous @jebbush ad about me, jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him so sad 
poor @jebbush spent $50 million on his campaign, i spent almost nothing. he's bottom (and gone), i'm top (by a lot). that's what u.s. needs 
@classyexplorer: @gatewaypundit jim you fail to mention in your cnn poll that in the gop race...trump is leading cruz 39 to 18...big detail 

@ihatematt: @realdonaldtrump why is hillary even allowed to run... she's a criminal. 
@ihatematt: @realdonaldtrump why is hillary even allowed to run... she's a criminal. good question 
hillary said i really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign. i deplore the death and destruction she caused stupidity 

hillary, when you complain about a penchant for sexism, who are you referring to. i have great respect for women. be careful 
it is hard to believe i am winning by so much when i am treated so badly by the media. new @cnn poll amazing in all categories. 21 pt. lead 
why does @foxnews give @karlrove so much airtime. he (and other fox pundits) is so biased. still thinks romney won. unfair coverage of trump 
.@foxnews treats me so badly. using old quinnipiac poll where i have a much smaller lead than the just out @cnn poll. all negative 


the hillary clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. be careful hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card. 


big news just out new @cnn poll trump 39 and leads in every major category. likeability way up. cruz 18 carson 10 rubio 10 
we need a president with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again 
it is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. sad 
when i said that hillary clinton got schlonged by obama, it meant got beaten badly. the media knows this. often used word in politics 

wow, new reuters poll just out. big lead if you want to make america great again trump 37 cruz 11 this is at the top of drudge 



jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering jeb's statements. he is really pathetic 
watching @cnn and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. boring and biased 

@schoremis1: @jebbush the donald should've been named man of the year. he dominates the polls, news, talk shows & social media. maga 
@qbeacademy: well i'm at 42% and your at 3% .you know jeb you started over here you keep on moving further and further off stage. classic 
.@jebbush's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible fumbled around, incoherent. 
why doesn't @jebbush, in his ads, show my answer to his statement in the debate? 
will @jebbush, in his phony advertising campaign, show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate? 
.@jebbush just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy. will never work 
weak and low energy @jebbush, whose campaign is a disaster, is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy. 
@_msfl_: @realdonaldtrump @trumpusa16 a great patriot 
@realnevadie: this suggests that online polls are more reliable so trump is crushing both parties. @realdonaldtrump 
@philmonaco67: @realdonaldtrump 100% donald trump supporter go trump make america great again 

@janienorris22: @realdonaldtrump got my autographed book yesterday can't wait to read it. you got them scared to death love it. . great 






@herschelwalker, thanks for your support it is very much appreciated 
getting ready to leave for michigan will be an amazing evening see you there. 
do you think that hillary clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about the video of me being used by isis. there is no video. 
thanks @andreatantaros for all of your kind words and thoughts. big progress is being made. keep up the great work 
a suicide bomber has just killed u.s. troops in afghanistan. when will our leaders get tough and smart. we are being led to slaughter 

it's the democrats' total weakness & incompetence that gave rise to isis not a tape of donald trump that was an admitted hillary lie 

getting ready to go to the great state of michigan. big crowd tonight. make america great again 
just out: trump gop debate 18,000,000. clinton democrat debate 6,700,000. and they were on major network vs. cable 
hillary said with respect to isis, we are finally where we need to be. do we want 4 more years of incompetent leadership? maga 
i demand an apology from hillary clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate. there never was a video. 
hillary said at debate isis is going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst. she made up story want apology 
very sad what happened last night at the miss universe pageant. i sold it 6 months ago for a record price. this would never have happened 
@msully65: tell this knitwit @speakerryan, the ppl want @realdonaldtrump, not him or his choice for president thts why trump has 40% 

.@jebbush today said he didn't want to be the front runner, he would rather be where he is now, 2%. that is the talk of a loser, can't win 


.@missuniverse final 3 on now. great people, great new owner @img. watch. 

it was really strange when hillary was missing from the podium last night. not very presidential 
hillary clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no isis video of me. therefore, hillary lied at the debate last night. sad 
.@jebbush was terrible on face the nation today. being at 2% and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence. a basket case 


hillary clinton lied when she said that isis is using video of donald trump as a recruiting tool. this was fact checked by @foxnews: false 



@domineeksmith: @realdonaldtrump is the best republican presidential candidate of all time. thank you. 


.@jonkarl was totally misled, and he fell for it, that hillary wants to run against me. she knows that i am her worst nightmare jon doesn't 


@tomskeet: @realdonaldtrump @gstephanopoulos haha she's not ready for the donald 

@gstephanopoulos: as @realdonaldtrump dominates the latest polls, i’ll talk to the gop frontrunner, sunday on @thisweekabc. 
.@gstephanopoulos stupidly believes that hillary wants to run against me because she said so. she says that so people believe it opposite 



president obama spends so much time speaking of the so called carbon footprint, and yet he flies all the way to hawaii on a massive old 747. 
see, sanders backed hillary on e mails at the debate, hurting himself, and then she threw him under the bus (but failed). disloyal person 





the last thing our country needs is another bush dumb as a rock 
.@jebbush has embarrassed himself & his family with his incompetent campaign for president. he should remain true to himself. 

weak & ineffective @jebbush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. false advertising 
i have an idea for @jebbush whose campaign is a disaster. try using your last name & don’t be ashamed of it 
.@melindadc don’t misrepresent in order to make a point. i was always tough on isis as you’ll find out after i get elected. 
.@charleshurt thanks for defending me so brilliantly against @melindadc always tough when they falsify. 













hillary clinton is weak and ineffective no strength, no stamina. 
@endlessmike03: @realdonaldtrump @oreillyfactor omg awesome what time zone ? 
@chained111: @realdonaldtrump @oreillyfactor yes sir 
@steelerdan619: @realdonaldtrump @oreillyfactor your the man 
@2timeslucky: @realdonaldtrump @oreillyfactor you were amazing 
@borntobegop: @realdonaldtrump @oreillyfactor the only person in politics who shouldn’t have term limits is president trump cute 
jeb bush had a tough night at the debate. now he'll probably take some of his special interest money, he is their puppet, and buy ad's. 
thank you for the nice words @ktmcfarland. the debate was interesting, and fun. keep up the great work 
will be interviewed on the @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 p.m. will be talking about the debate, and more 
bill o'reilly calls trump and campaign brilliant. in first place by 27 points. 
.@markhalperin works so hard but just doesn't have a natural instinct for politics. others do, and those are the people you want to follow 
thank you @davidaxelrod for your nice words this morning on @cnn. it was a good night 
thank you, so many people have given me credit for winning the debate last night. all polls agree. it was fun and interesting 
@insuradude: the fix is in donald did his best performance and @markhalperin @morning_joe has jeb scoring higher? jeb looked in pain joke 




@conradmblack: many thanks donald, and all good wishes in helping to clean up the american government. honored to be your friend. c. 
@tinahillstrom1: @governorpataki @governorpataki just called @realdonaldtrump the president 

@sperkins50: @cnn @lindseygrahamsc @realdonaldtrump donald represents real americans. thank you 
@golddstr1: @diamondandsilk @realdonaldtrump they noticed alright,graham and patiki are just mad because they dont have a chance. 
@janibetancoirt: @cnn @lindseygrahamsc @realdonaldtrump pataki needs a brain surgeon 
@roberth25937464: @cnn @lindseygrahamsc @realdonaldtrump lindsey still doesn't hear americans still at zero it's like monty python. 

@mrdeuce25: @cnn @lindseygrahamsc donaldtrump good were glad he doesn't represent what you stand for lindsey. you are weak and have no clue 
@billdaley1: @cnn @lindseygrahamsc @realdonaldtrump sour grapes graham. dont blame trump because you cant interest voters. 

highly respected public policy polling (ppp) just announced that i am number one in iowa. thank you 




i won every debate so far according to all debate polls including @drudge_report, @time @slate and more. too bad dopey @megynkelly lies 
between iraq war monger @krauthammer, dummy @karlrove, deadpan @georgezwill, highly overrated @megynkelly, among others, @foxnews not fair 
i am in trump international hotel, las vegas, getting ready and waiting for the debate tonight. look forward hope i get treated fairly 
i wonder if @megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight. no matter how well i do bad 
.@megynkelly is very bad at math. she was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and cruz in the new monmouth poll 41to14. 
.@megynkelly, the most overrated anchor at @foxnews, worked hard to explain away the new monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead. she said 15 
why isn't anyone using the @cnn iowa poll with me having a big lead. they only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place).dishonest press 
isn't it amazing that @cnn paid a fortune for an iowa poll, which shows me in first place over cruz by 13%, 33% to 20% then doesn't use it 
wow, i just had two very good iowa polls and a phenomenal just out national poll from @abc @washingtonpost 38%. make america great again 

@piersmorgan: donald trump vs hillary clinton would be the greatest presidential battle in history. 
@ladykellliberty: @anncoulter i'm in pa near pburgh. dad will register to vote first time for trump. mom is changing from d to r 



@oreillyfactor, horrible defense of me against highly overrated @krauthammer. i will bring more people into the party & easily beat hillary 


thank you @hardball_chris for your nice words. they are very much appreciated. i fully understand that you really get it. 

can't believe major league baseball just rejected @peterose_14 for the hall of fame. he's paid the price. so ridiculous let him in 



another great accolade for @trumpgolf. highly respected golf odyssey awarded @trumpdoral blue monster with best redesign. thank you 



why doesn't @foxnews quote the new iowa @cnn poll where i have a 33% to 20% lead over ted cruz and all others. think about it 


people have got to stop working to be so politically correct and focus all of their energy on finding solutions to very complex problems 

@lesgartcpa: @jaketapper @realdonaldtrump problem is i never watched you until trump started giving you interviews and ratings on cnn. 

@jpmorgan2016: trump needs his own poll a real poll, in every state. these polls are so ridiculous.the media will only get worse from here 
@1rdgreenberg: @foxnews that's why, after your interview, i couldn't watch the panel discussion, which is usually my favorite segment. 
@energy43: @schnoepoe @foxnews not so much fairness as it is about ratings . megan kellys hate nightly of trump is turn off for fox 
i was disappointed that ted cruz would speak behind my back, get caught, and then deny it. well, welcome to the wonderful world of politics 
i did interview with chris wallace of @foxnews in order to be fair. he then puts on rove, lane and will, three trump bashers, to discuss. 
@theprodigy3d: everyone vote for @realdonaldtrump and no he did not pay me for this endorsement. 
@schnoepoe: @foxnews i find myself more and more drawn to cnn for fairness regarding @realdonaldtrump the fox news sunday pundits a joke 
@vylvisaker: @anncoulter trump has stamina, he is working harder than any other candidate. he really loves america . he deserves to win. 
many think that the championship course at turnberry, home of the duel in the sun, will be the worlds best after the renovation. 
a very good nbc/wall street journal poll was just released wherein i went up from last month and am in the lead. nice 
@berniesanders: abc news spent 81 minutes on donald trump and only 20 seconds on our campaign. that's because @abc is smart 
.@danawhite great job last night very exciting you have come a long way from those difficult early days, i am proud of you. 
people that have read it tell me that @karlrove book is terrible (and boring). save your money @foxnews should can him, no credibility 

@yoel_ny: @realdonaldtrump @peggynoonannyc as a democrat i have to say, since hillary is the front runner, i will choose trump. 
@jpmorgan2016: @realdonaldtrump @peggynoonannyc trump is winning by so much more, it's near 60% nationally. they are all biased polls 
@rosemarylowe105: @shahkourosh @spacemanchris @realdonaldtrump that is why we don't need a politician to be the next president. 
@straighthand: @realdonaldtrump i'd pay to watch that the donald vs hillary get ready 

@mikepetrella17: @peggynoonannyc i agree with trump. record turnouts . there's a lot of potential voters that trump is tapping into. 
chris wallace @fox at 10:00 a.m. 

.@cnn @jaketapper at 9:00 a.m. 
.@peggynoonannyc an election between hillary and myself will be the biggest voter turnout in u.s. history. just like the debates 24 m vs 2m. 
.@peggynoonannyc interesting article, but i will beat hillary easily. people that have given up on the system will come out to vote for me 
@michael2014abc: @alwaleed_talal @realdonaldtrump has your country, saudi arabia, taken any of the syrian refugees? if not, why not? 
something must be done with dopey @karlrove he is pushing republicans down the same old path of defeat. don't fall for it, karl is a loser 


@latinos4trump16: @realdonaldtrump @jaketapper @cnn i'll be watching 
@ofccadjust: @realdonaldtrump @jaketapper @cnn dvr set 
i will be interviewed on @jaketapper @cnn at 9:00 a.m. and fox news sunday with chris wallace at 10:o0 a.m. cnn iowa poll 13 point lead 

new cnn iowa poll trump 33, cruz 20. everyone else way down don't trust des moines register poll biased towards trump 




getting the support of @danawhite of ufc means a lot. a total winner, who has done an amazing job. just ordered his fight to watch tonight 
.@franklin_graham, so many people have tweeted about your amazing words to me, thank you heading to big crowd in south carolina 

i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00 a.m. so much to talk about 
.@loudobbsnews did a fantastic interview with syndicated columnist michelle malkin. congrats to both 
@jenniferjjacobs: trump: protect the 2nd amendment...and by the way we’re going to be saying merry christmas again. iowa crowd loves it. 
@jenniferjjacobs: iowa's rnc committeewoman tamara scott praises trump and asks why the rnc would not be thrilled with his candidacy. 
@jenniferjjacobs: trump says he was establishment. i backed mccain he lost. i backed romney he lost. this time i'm doing it myself. 
@keeblerqueen: @realdonaldtrump good lord ... donald.. your following went up so much lately ... crazy love for you and what you stand for 


just got back from iowa, great people 

.@monicacrowley you were great with @seanhannity on @foxnews tonight. thank you for your kind words. we will keep americans safe. 




tom ridge is a failed 'bushy' & pa governor. him & his friend @karlrove shouldn't be allowed to do their bias commentary nobody listens 
tom ridge should be focused on trying to bring the party together rather than ripping it apart w/ your faulty thought process. i will win 



.@chucktodd is a nice guy , but just hopeless. he knows so little about politics and, in particular, winning i fixed his rating problem. 
.@morning_joe just went off the rails. i will beat hillary easily she does not want to run against me. i am tuning them out, waste of time 
.@tedcruz should not make statements behind closed doors to his bosses, he should bring them out into the open more fun that way 
looks like @tedcruz is getting ready to attack. i am leading by so much he must. i hope so, he will fall like all others. will be easy 
.@morning_joe is so off on iowa, which i am leading big in new @cnn poll. i will win iowa. also, i beat hillary easily 
great evening last night in new hampshire. got the endorsement from the new england police union big territory, great people thank you. 
.@bernardgoldberg was not good tonight on @oreillyfactor. he just doesn't know about winning but he is a nice guy. 

@foxnews: @frankluntz: time for the republican establishment to accept the fact that trump is not only a viable candidate, but lead is real 
@edwards_cristy: @realdonaldtrump i hope that you will be the next potus. 
respected morning consult poll just out. i lead all republicans and beat hillary head to head by a wide margin 45 to 40 
in britain, more muslims join isis than join the british army.http://www.nationalreview.com/article/428146/more than few islamic extremists?utm_campaign=trueanthem%3a trending content&utm_content=5667aeff04d3016bf289ee1e&utm_medium=trueanthem&utm_source=twitter … 
thank you to @franklin_graham. i have always appreciated your courage, but now more so than ever 


establishment flunky @karlrove is going crazy with the just released cbs poll that has me way ahead. new fox poll has me beating hillary. 
dummy @karlrove continues to make and write false statements. he still thinks romney won he should get a life 




the united kingdom is trying hard to disguise their massive muslim problem. everybody is wise to what is happening, very sad be honest. 
i have decided to postpone my trip to israel and to schedule my meeting with @netanyahu at a later date after i become president of the u.s. 
our visa system is broken, like so much else in our country. we better get it fixed really fast. make america great again 
i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends this morning at 7:30. so much to talk about 
wow, my poll numbers have just been announced and have gone through the roof 
.@megynkelly spent a big part of her show talking about other shows spending so much time on me. really weird, she's being driven crazy 
@jimparkey: @realdonaldtrump @donlemon @cnn great interview speaking calmly but carrying a heavy stick thank you 
weak and totally conflicted people like @therickwilson shouldn't be allowed on television unless given an i.q. test. dumb as a rock @cnn 
@quinnlisaq: @cnn @donlemon . the people do not care what politician said about trump . we still support him all the way 
great interview tonight @donlemon very professionally done. @cnn 


@ajdx4sdesq: @cnn @donlemon @realdonaldtrump this is the best interview so far. honest, well reasoned and without all the name calling. 
@michaelurso2: mr trump did you deny megyn kelly. what is her issue i used to like her. can't stand her now. very little talent @foxnews 
thank you @oreillyfactor for your wonderful editorial as to why i should have been @time magazine's person of the year. you should run time 

why does @cnn bore their audience with people like @secupp, a totally biased loser who doesn't have a clue. i hear she will soon be gone 
.@secupp, who can't believe that her candidate has bombed so badly, is one of the dumber pundits on t.v. hard to watch, zero talent @cnn 
.@donlemon on @cnn at 10:00 p.m. 

i am interviewed on the @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00. then at 10:00, i am interviewed by @donlemon on @cnn. enjoy 


the police in london say i’m right. major article in daily mail. “we can’t wear uniform in our own cars.”http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article 3352406/scotland yard mocks trump s claims london police terrified muslim areas officers claim tycoon right.html … 

thank you, piers, they don't know what they're getting into.https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/674621112131723264 … 
.@mayor_nutter of philadelphia, who is doing a terrible job, should be ashamed for using such a disgusting word in referring to me.low life 


i told you @time magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite they picked person who is ruining germany 
@mysteriousloser: @realdonaldtrump did you hear the mayor nutter of philadelphias comments towards you? ignorance yes, he is a crude dope 

@ray_aub: @nytimes @cnn people forget the policies of leaders like @jebbush allowed 9/11 killers to immigrate, drive, & pilot planes 
hillary clinton does not have the strength or stamina to be president. we need strong and super smart for our next leader or trouble 
the last person corrupt hillary clinton wants to run against is donald j. trump. i'll end up beating her in every state. new fox poll trump 
the failing @nytimes does not mention the new @cnn poll that has me leading iowa by a massive 13 points i am at 33%. maggie haberman, sad 
@usafordjtrump: @realdonaldtrump @cnn mr. trump, you need to get some rest. we need you to stay healthy so that you can be our president 
@yitzyschwartz: @cnn anyone who hates on trump hates on america. we are a proud nation lacking a leader. choose trump to bring us 
great poll numbers just coming out of new hampshire. big lead for trump according to @cnn 
wow, what a day. so many foolish people that refuse to acknowledge the tremendous danger and uncertainty of certain people coming into u.s. 
our country is facing a major threat from radical islamic terrorism. we better get very smart, and very tough, fast, before it is too late 
despite my great respect for king abdullah ii, i will not be visiting jordan at this time. this is in response to the false @ap report. 
prior to the end of the year, i will be traveling to israel. i am very much looking forward to it. 

will be on @abc news tonight at 6:30. interviewed by the legendary @barbarajwalters enjoy 
the legendary @barbarajwalters will be asking me questions about the presidential campaign on @wntonight at 6:30 pm. 
a very big poll is coming out at 6 pm in new hampshire. will be very interested in the results. 


i wish the @wsj wall street journal had reported the just out @cnn iowa poll correctly. i lead by a wide margin,13 points, going up big 
just won iowa @cnn poll big: trump 33% cruz 20% rubio 11%, but @wsj reported cruz momentum but nothing about the fact that i easily won 

@xgnraging: @realdonaldtrump i hope you become president 

@genemcgee6: @realdonaldtrump @seanhannity is so great towards you. just doesn't like people on his show to bad mouth you. he is great . 
@charlesmarino8: @3dot donaldtrump preach it brother first election i've been excited about in many many years. since reagan to be exact 


@truth_or_rumor: @realarthurspina @realdonaldtrump hey hillary, america will feel much safer once you've failed to get into office. 
@back2reason: @realdonaldtrump can't wait for president trump to put things in order in us. we desperately need patriot with,finally,brains 

just released @cnn poll gives me a big 13 point lead in iowa. change your false story failing @nytimes. thank you iowa 



just put out a very important policy statement on the extraordinary influx of hatred & danger coming into our country. we must be vigilant 

i am especially grateful for the tremendous support i have received from the evangelicals in the just out iowa cnn poll. thank you 
i am greatly honored by the results of the cnn poll in iowa. in the end, i believe the final results will be even better than that 
.@washingtonpost is going out of its way to tell failing candidates how to beat donald trump.the post doesn’t get that i’m good at winning 
@borntobegop @danscavino trump will only increase his lead after the terror attacks. america believes trump will get rid of isis 




if @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. the @washingtonpost scam is saving it 
the @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @jeffbezos power to screw public on low taxation of @amazon big tax shelter 
the @washingtonpost, which loses a fortune, is owned by @jeffbezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, @amazon. 
n.y.c. has the worst mayor in the united states. i hate watching what is happening with the dirty streets, the homeless and crime disgrace 
i spoke with other candidates to a jewish group, many friends, in d.c. i said i'm a negotiator like you got standing o rated best of day 
obama said in his speech that muslims are our sports heroes. what sport is he talking about, and who? is obama profiling? 
thank you graham ledger of the daily ledger @oann for your really fair coverage and your great interview with peter roff of u.s. news & w.r. 

@wiggintonrandy: @realdonaldtrump he will never say it, therefore he will never have a solution 
well, obama refused to say (he just can't say it), that we are at war with radical islamic terrorists. 
should have gone after the oil years ago (like i have been saying). 
wish obama would say isis, like almost everyone else, rather than isil. 
is that all there is? we need a new president fast 
@homefreeee: @realdonaldtrump he needs to stop all visas not look at them 
@jfk4701: @realdonaldtrump he is reading off the teleprompter. but that is o.k. in this case. 

@10inchpolitics: @realdonaldtrump air strikes? who's air strikes?? 
@dboiarsky: @realdonaldtrump make america great again, dt 
hope he won't spend too much time ripping apart the 2nd. amendment 
the podium in the oval office looks odd not good, but the words will be the key. 
hillary won't call out radical islam she will be soundly defeated. 
i will be re tweeting some of your better, most imaginative and hopefully insightful tweets. make them good (great) important stuff. 
big night on twitter tonight. i will be live tweeting president obama's speech at 7:50 p.m. ( eastern). must talk radical islamic terrorism 
gee, @meetthepress with @chucktodd was getting terrible ratings then, with me, he set records i saved his job, but chuck still not nice 





wow, @georgewill said some very nice things about me today on @foxnewssunday with chris wallace. i am making progress, thanks george 
i will be live tweeting president obama's prime time speech tonight starting at 7:50 p.m. (eastern).will he finally state the real problems? 

@mollymaguires61: @politichick_ @nytpolitics @foxnews @rupertmurdoch @gop in bed together & hate trump. win it for the usa & the 21st cent 


.@brookslawbrooks thank you so much for your nice words. i will make you look very smart 
@brianbl43802294 @johnkasich trump is not controlled by donors,special interests,lobbyists like u.ur a total puppet.trump is working 4 u.s. 
so, how did i do on face the nation? 
watch face the nation will be on now 
hillary just said that she will not use the term radical islamic but was incapable of saying why. she is afraid of obama & the e mails 

@jsears68: poll numbers will go up even more for @realdonaldtrump after obama's 'address' 
@dr_tweedy: @cnn @johnkasich kasick message is as muddled and stagnant as his political career. lied about trump crowd. media he lied 
i will be interviewed on face the nation @cbsnews at 10:30 a.m. should be interesting enjoy 
was going to do a phoner this morning with @jaketapper on @cnn but they could not get their phone equipment to hook in. will do next week. 
wonder if obama will ever say radical islamic terrorist? 

@pimpburgh2015: @katyturnbc @realdonaldtrump just tweeted that you are a third rate reporter. that's only because i'm being nice 
@maddow, you copied incompetent @katyturnbc incorrect story. i'm sure you would like to apologize to me on show. thank you for the courtesy.

a total refutation of the disgraceful david brooks column in the failing @nytimes by the @washingtonpost:https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the fix/wp/2015/12/04/the problem with the donald trump pink rug theory/ … 

.@jrubinblogger one of the dumber bloggers @washingtonpost only writes purposely inaccurate pieces on me. she is in love with marco rubio? 
the horrible shooting that took place in san bernardino was an absolute act of terror that many people knew about. why didn’t they report? 
.@marthamaccallum martha, great interview with my son @erictrump smart, tough & professional. thank you @foxnews 

the virtually incompetent republican strategist who has had a failed career, cheri jacobus, is incoherent with anger that her puppets died 
.@cnn & @cnnpolitics please thank alisyn camerota, david chalian and john king for the very professional reporting of the new cnn poll. 
.@cnn poll just came out, amazing numbers for those who want to make america great again trump 36%, a 20 point lead over 2nd place. thanks.

great to see the construction of the old post office on penn ave. going fast under budget, ahead of schedule 
it was recently reported that 3rd rate $ losing @politico is a foil for the clintons. questions given to clinton in advance. no credibility. 
thank you so much for the wonderful article, robert davi.http://www.breitbart.com/big hollywood/2015/11/30/robert davi donald trump is the john wayne of politics/ … 



why can't @politico get better reporters than ben schreckenger? guy is a major lightweight with no credibility. so dishonest 
loved being in manassas, va last night. such incredible spirit now in dc for a speech, will then visit old post office under construction.

curtis sliwa doing tv commentary on 9/13/2001. good job curtis. please send your apologies to @realdonaldtrump.pic.twitter.com/g07vzmnmaw 
look at the editorial i was just sent from the ny post on 9/14/01 3 days after collapse of wtc. any apologies?pic.twitter.com/b6dkeok8px 
jamiel shaw was incredible on @foxandfriends this morning. his son, who was viciously killed by an illegal immigrant, is so proud of pop 
i want to thank all my friends in macon for the special evening and great reception. what a crowd of incredible people 



meeting with african american pastors at trump tower was amazing. wonderful news conference followed. now off to georgia for big speech 

we better be vigilant, careful, and strong.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w5btqgtgoi4 … 

how is chris christie running the state of nj, which is deeply troubled, when he is spending all of his time in nh? new jerseyans not happy 
wow, the msm is really going after me. 12,000 in sarasota, a love fest, hardly a mention. only one negativity they only want negatives 
@charlottepturn: @morning_joe there were no video cell phones is areuall looking4bonus?near stjoes hosp paterson nj arab area outside celeb 
@wzpd8z: mr. trump, chuck todd is a moron, all kinds of youtube videos showing muslims celebrating 911. i would show it on your ads. 
@wompol: @realdonaldtrump @cnn we also saw numerous (since scrubbed) videos of celebrations on 9/11 
when will @cnn get some real political talent rather than political commentators like errol louis, who doesn't have a clue others bad also. 
@beckyomz: @juvenile @thehill we could use a new era of greatness america needs to return to its place in the world leading 

@thisweekabc: maria, why do you work with such dummies as cokie roberts, @billkristol, @mattbai? you can do much better @mariatcardona. 

@dmsrcmc12bob: @realdonaldtrump they should all get on the trump train so true 

@rketeltas: every time trump is gracious enough to do a msm interview he gets ambushed with nonsensical questions, why is that. 


great job @mariatcardona on @thisweekabc. you made kooky cokie roberts and @billkristol look even dumber than they are. you will be right 

after my meeting with the pastors, it's off to georgia for a big rally many thousands of great people will be there, a beautiful movement 
will be meeting on monday at trump tower with a large group of african american pastors. many i know wonderful people not a press event. 
just watched cookie roberts on @abc. her predictions have been so wrong for so long that she has lost all credibility. just another sad case 



@allibiis: @realdonaldtrump @artpar17 @cnn story is bogus. donald trump has the most diverse group of voters/supporters in the gop field. 
.@cnn has to do better reporting if it wants to keep up with the crowd.so totally one sided and biased against me that it is becoming boring 
@pablo44x: @cnn @realdonaldtrump another hit piece by cnn. what? we're not biased 
i will be on @meetthepress in an interview with @chucktodd on sunday morning. so much to talk about 
@artpar17: @cnn your story is a total fraud i agree 
@jacoh: @cnn @realdonaldtrump i can't believe how low cnn can go. obviously a bunch of killary fans. @cnn only says negative bad reporters 
the sarasota, florida, rally today was amazing. 12,000 people chanting their love for our country. it's going to happen, this is a movement 
.@cnn kayleigh mcenany was great on you network today. you should have her on more often thank you kayleigh for your nice words. 

@nobaddog: @repbjnikkel @cindyblackwel12 johnkasich all you career politicians are shaking in your shoes for fear trump gets elected 
@jameslauer6: @david360nc @azblonde2015 now's the time 4 christians to get out the vote big time to save christianity once & 4 all. trump 


@munciewolves: @realdonaldtrump america backs you. your our next president thank you 
virtually no one has spent more money in helping the american people with disabilities than me. will discuss today at my speech in sarasota 
the reporter who pulled back from his 14 year old never retracted story is having fun. i don't know what he looks like and don't know him 
i will be going to sarasota, florida, today for a big rally with amazing people i have one goal on mind: make america great again 



@margaretcrowth1: @realdonaldtrump incompetence now the norm. nytimes is an example. need competent leader as role model. trump2016 
@reallyo1: @realdonaldtrump @marksimoneny don't let the jackals in the media trip u up. their getting desperate 
@margaretcrowth1: @realdonaldtrump so like the media to make something out of nothing. don't let them sidetrack from the message. 
@deusvultgeorgia: @mingblueteacup @rickcanton @_holly_renee @realdonaldtrump should the reporter's dishonesty be shielded from ridicule? 
@vaughnvhalen: donald trump rises to 38% nationally; ted cruz edges into 2nd at 12% 
@marksimoneny: great twitter quote about donald trump: never apologize for fake controversies whipped up by the perpetually offended media 
@rketeltas: @realdonaldtrump if you combine the business models for both macy's & the ny times, both are on a rapid decline, such a pity. 
@pthebnyc: @realdonaldtrump @sari_swensen @nytimes no need to explain, sir. we've got your back. thanks 
@beezakamrb: @realdonaldtrump shopping @macys is no longer a family christmas time tradition in my house. great, a very disloyal chain 
the failing @nytimes should focus on fair and balanced reporting rather than constant hit jobs on me. yesterday 3 boring articles, today2 
i do not know the reporter for the @nytimes, or what he looks like. i was showing a person groveling to take back a statement made long ago 

@prisonplanet: .@realdonaldtrump gets it. never apologize for fake controversies whipped up by the perpetually offended media. 

happy thanksgiving to all. have a great day and look forward to the future. we will make america great again 
the numbers at the @nytimes are so dismal, especially advertising revenue, that big help will be needed fast. a once great institution sad 
so, since the people at the @nytimes have made all bad decisions over the last decade, why do people care what they write. incompetent 
the dopes at the @nytimes bought the boston globe for $1.3 billion and sold it for $1.00. their great old headquarters gave it away so dumb 
the @nytimes is so poorly run and managed that other family members are looking to take over control. with unfunded liabilities big trouble 
@riosunny3: @realdonaldtrump @wkrg i lived in new jersey at that time and witnessed all that as well. 
the failing @nytimes should be focused on good reporting and the papers financial survival and not with constant hits on donald trump 
@keeping__real: so good to see the @realdonaldtrump family out with him on the campaign trail it really shows the family man that he is 





@karlrove just totally bombed on @morning_joe. @foxnews has him on even though he has lost all credibility a loser fox should dump rove. 
@franmfarber: @morning_joe @foxnews @morningmika did not say very nice things about you this morning on her show. typical liberal true 

@raider8381: @morning_joe @foxnews america wants donald trump tv heads still refuse to embrace that reality media are liars. 
@patty_laughlin: donaldtrump @karl @morning_joe @foxnews never thought much of carl.. make america great again trump for president 2016 
@donnysmith557: @karl @morning_joe @foxnews karl is a total joke if he didn't have the bush family and fox he wouldn't have anything 
south carolina was so great last night. will be back soon 
why would @greta use @karlrove as an election analyst when he has made so many mistakes. he still thinks romney won. an establishment dope 
@idawhannadoyou: @realdonaldtrump @oann love it. wish i could get @oann i hear good things about them such as objective unbiased reporting.

@good2bqueen67: .@realdonaldtrump @sandikay60 i enjoyed the speech so much tonight, you were on point sir thanks. 

@port3star: @jdiamond1 @cnnpolitics you know he has great vision. the very best. many people have told him so. thousands of people

@donnysmith557: @realdonaldtrump everything mr. trump touches turns to gold, what a great negotiator thanks. 
heading for ohio really big crowd of amazing people much to talk about 

.@wsj reports that @gop getting ready to treat me unfairly—big spending planned against me. that wasn’t the deal 



going to columbus, ohio today for a tremendous rally of thousands. the silent majority is no longer silent 
.@ap has one of the worst reporters in the business @jeffhorwitz wouldn’t know the truth if it hit him in the face. 
.@ap continues to do extremely dishonest reporting. always looking for a hit to bring them back into relevancy—ain’t working 
.@matthewjdowd thank you for the nice comments recently, especially on @barbarajwalters. my family & i greatly appreciate your kind words. 
hillary clinton is weak on illegal immigration, among many other things. she is strong on corruption corruption is what she's best at 

@ktd101551: @cnnpolitics trump gave a great speech in ala. what's more important a protester? i wouldn't give these folks 1 sec of attn 
@jrpantiques: @realdonaldtrump @thefix @pbump the script for a great world changing leader to arise has been written & it was for mr. trump 
@bloggerjulie: @foxnews the reporter is the one who mentioned the national database first and not donaldtrump. y not report honest news? 
@mjp1370: @realdonaldtrump @thefix @pbump we need trump now obama isn't protecting americans 

@drewtheg: trump is the epitome of integrity, good spirit, forthright honesty... you pull no punches and call a spade a spade. diggin it 


@heiressarts: @realdonaldtrump by going after you, jindal also lost the la governor race politicians beware. 

we better get tough with radical islamic terrorists, and get tough now, or the life and safety of our wonderful country will be in jeopardy 
13 syrian refugees were caught trying to get into the u.s. through the southern border. how many made it? we need the wall 
great poll numbers all over and beating hillary clinton one on one. thank you 
big new @abc poll to be announced at 9:00 a.m. on this week with @gstephanopoulos. i will be interviewed on show 
.@gstephanopoulos just announced that i am leading big in the new @abc poll which will be shown on this week at 9:00 a.m. i will be on show 
will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00 a.m. 
i find that @reuters is a far more professional operation than @ap. 
.ccolvinj @ap is one of the truly bad reporters working for an organization that has totally lost its way. stories are fictional garbage. 










@gstephanopoulos: i’ll talk to donald trump about his comments on syrian refugees, and much more, sunday on @thisweekabc. 

.@heytana, great job we are all proud of you 


it's too bad so few people showed up to @bobvanderplaats family leader dinner. next year i'll try & be there and they'll have a huge crowd 
thank you john nolte for wonderful analysis & reporting. 
rumor has it pataki, kasich, & senator lindsey graham are dropping out of the race very soon. hope it's not true, they're so easy to beat 
so nice when media properly polices media. thank you @breitbartnews.http://www.breitbart.com/big journalism/2015/11/21/muslim registry rope me hillary haberman lies about trump on nyt front page/ … 
a woman who got fired after two days of working with scott walker a wacko now trying to raise funds to fight me. 
heading to birmingham, alabama, and a massive crowd of incredible people 12 noon will be wild. 
to show you how politicians act, bobby jindal spent $1,000 to register in new hampshire & dropped out the next day. such a waste 
we're stuck with the worst mayor in the united states. too bad, but new york city will survive 
people are really liking my new book, crippled america. check it out 
@tas0727: @realdonaldtrump make america great again vote donald trump

.@gracematters thank you, a very wise bet best wishes. 
just got back from south carolina. going to alabama tomorrow 





i didn't suggest a database a reporter did. we must defeat islamic terrorism & have surveillance, including a watch list, to protect america 

my family has the honor of being interviewed for a full hour by the legendary @barbarajwalters tonight @abc 10pme.pic.twitter.com/cm4fv1ye9l 
.@mkhammer, a fox contributor, isn't smart enough to know what is going on at the border. @thejuanwilliams made the point far better 
going to south carolina now, great place, sro crowd. iowa was amazing yesterday 
the media must denigrate isis at all levels or youth will continue to be drawn to it. these are low level degenerates, not masterminds 
the media must immediately stop calling isis leaders masterminds. call them instead thugs and losers. young people must not go into isis 


john kasich was managing director of lehman brothers when it crashed, bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. a total failure 
once john kasich announced he was running for president, and opened his mouth, people realized he was a complete & total dud 
john kasich fell right into president obama’s trap on obamacare, and the people of ohio are suffering for it. shame 
doesn’t help kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else he’s almost last. 
john kasich ad guy wanted to work for me, but his proposal was a rip off – i said no now ripping kasich. 
i loved beating john kasich in the debates, but it was easy—he came in dead last 
kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in new hampshire and his numbers have gone down. people from nh are smart 
watch kasich squirm if he is not truthful in his negative ads i will sue him just for fun 
i want to do negative ads on john kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that i don’t want to waste my money. 
john kasich, despite being governor of ohio, is losing to me in the ohio polls. pathetic 
john kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me. 
governor kasich, whose failed campaign & debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me. 
the legendary barbara walters interviews melania trump and me on a special this friday night at 10:00 on abc. don't miss it 

just the beginning & it is going to get worse. rates & deductibles are so high nobody is going to be able to use it.http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottgottlieb/2015/11/19/uniteds warning shows how medicaid is taking over obamacare/ … 


thank you (chris) @thefix. i have great respect for professionals that are willing to report so honestly & fairly.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the fix/wp/2015/11/19/yes donald trump could absolutely be the republican nominee in 2016/ … 


the police in paris did a fantastic job. very brave not easy 

everyone is now saying how right i was with illegal immigration & the wall. after paris, they’re all on the bandwagon. 

i skipped a speech given years ago at mar a lago by dopey @georgewill because he’s boring—he never forgot 
dopey @georgewill, a big proponent of the iraq war and other catastrophes, doesn’t like me very much. that means i win 
broken down political pundit @georgewill, who is wrong almost all of the time, should be thrown off @foxnews. boring and totally biased 
eight syrians were just caught on the southern border trying to get into the u.s. isis maybe? i told you so. we need a big & beautiful wall 
ben carson is being severely criticized for being incapable of understanding foreign policy be one of his top consultants. not good

@ashevillelaura: @realdonaldtrump @seanhannity @foxnews obama has no credibility on terrorist threats & isis. trump best to protect us 
i will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10:00 on @foxnews . much, much, much to talk about 

.@ap is doing very badly. i can say from experience their reporting is terrible & highly inaccurate. sadly, they are now irrelevant 
one of the saddest things in journalism is what happened to the formerly great @ap. they have lost their way and are no longer credible. 


refugees from syria are now pouring into our great country. who knows who they are some could be isis. is our president insane? 
i, along with almost everyone else, have so little confidence in president obama. he has a horrible attitude a man who is resigned to defeat 
so many great polls like reuters big leads everywhere. new hampshire really special we will win big and make america great again 

just received a copy of @sarahpalinusa new book a great read sarah is a terrific person. 


just landing in knoxville, tennessee massive crowd expected will all have a great time, despite serious subject matter. 



republicans must stop listening to dopes like @karlrove who still insists mitt romney won the last election. think big & think strong 
wow, @macys shares are down more than 40% this year. i never knew my ties & shirts not being sold there would have such a big impact 
interesting article from highly respected wayne allyn roothttp://www.theblaze.com/contributions/islamic state terrorist attack proves donald trump was right about border and immigration/ … 
remember, i was the one who said attack the oil (isis source of wealth) a long time ago. everyone scoffed, now they're attacking the oil. 
@sarahpalinusa: from st. patrick's cathedral, nyc: blessings, prayers and heartfelt concern for those in paris. 
@streetr77: @johnlegere @tmobile didn't know he was ceo of tmobile, i have t mobile, it's pathetic, dropped calls, no service. 
tom brady just did it again. he is not only a great guy, he is, without question, the best quarterback 
president obama just told president putin how important the russian air strikes against isis have been. i told you so 
.@johnlegere @tmobile john, focus on running your company, i think the service is terrible try hiring some good managers. 
@peg4cats: @terrylambert201 @realdonaldtrump you are so right. i only trust trump to be tough on immigration 
@760_831: @dansaltsman @realdonaldtrump @michaelcohen212 @ivankatrump i have faith he will win and save america 
@760_831: @dansaltsman @realdonaldtrump @michaelcohen212 @ivankatrump i have faith he will win and save america 

@syoka68: reading the comments of the leftists on here makes me nauseated. we so need you, mr. trump make america great again 
@davenorthyv: does anybody ever realize that hillaryclinton doesn't make eye contact with anyone, even the camera. that's a sign of lying 

@hturne: @vanityfair you're spot on he tries 2b an intellectual elitist.the truth: he has a low iq, no imagination, no creativity 
glad to see that @rondarousey lost her championship fight last night. was soundly beaten not a nice person 
i have watched sloppy graydon carter fail and close spy magazine and now am watching him fail at @vanityfair magazine. he is a total loser 
.@vanityfair magazine is doing really poorly. it has gotten worse and worse over the years, and has lost almost all of it's former allure 


@thewatcher23579: one of paris terrorist came as syrian refugee. donald trump is right again. bomb their oil take away their funding 
we need strong, tough and brilliant leadership now more than ever make america great again 
i had a great time in texas yesterday. a tremendous crowd of wonderful and enthusiastic people. will be back soon 

when will president obama issue the words radical islamic terrorism? he can't say it, and unless he will, the problem will not be solved 
@mnrosrnr: @realdonaldtrump the best book i've read in years, trump is right on every issue and has the best ideas, a true economic genius 


i think everyone will like my new and very successful book, crippled america. go get it and let me know what you think 
wow, bernie sanders just admitted that the real unemployment rate is 10% (it is actually over 20%) and for african american youth 51%. 
hillary and sanders are not doing well, but what is the failed former mayor of baltimore doing on that stage? o'malley is a clown. 
why won't president obama use the term islamic terrorism? isn't it now, after all of this time and so much death, about time 

@redletter99: @realdonaldtrump i absolutely love this, can't wait till u debate clinton 
@tomrichey: enough of these party debates. what i wanna see is a @sensanders vs @realdonaldtrump one on one debate that would be easy 




@gman0623: @realdonaldtrump @haloonefortrump @foxnews @cnn @gop i love you trump make america great again 


@jrpantiques: @realdonaldtrump @abcinsc @katrinapierson the world is playing everything right for trump every day his points are proven 
@dlt912: @realdonaldtrump you definitely have my vote 

@mario_posillico: @realdonaldtrump you need to win for not just america, but for humanity. 
we need much tougher, much smarter leadership and we need it now 
president obama said isil continues to shrink in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in paris. he is just so bad change. 
my prayers are with the victims and hostages in the horrible paris attacks. may god be with you all. 




.@seanhannity carly, whose campaign is dead, is making false statements about me in order to salvage hope sad. 
.@carlyfiorina had to inject herself into my factual statements concerning ben carson in order to breathe life into her failing campaign 
.@carlyfiorina i only said i was on @60minutes four weeks ago with putin—never said i was in green room. separate pieces—great ratings 
.@carlyfiorina ben carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper & pathological disease. i didn’t say it, he did. apology? 
.@carlyfiorina carly—i did graduate from wharton and did very well. who is your fact checker? will you apologize? 
.@carlyfiorina carly, not just you, i also told gov. kasich to “let jeb talk, give him a chance” because kasich was constantly cutting in. 
@drudge_report: reuters 5 day rolling poll: trump 34%, carson 19.6%, rubio 9.7%, cruz 7.7%... thank you a great honor 







from 2% to 27% in texas quite a jump into first place 
wow, pres. candidate ben carson, who is very weak on illegal immigration, just said he likes amnesty and a pathway to citizenship. 

.@wsj and dopey karl rove made a mistake and purposely mischaracterized my statement on the terrible tpp deal.https://theintercept.com/2015/11/11/trump was right about tpp benefitting china/ … 
why does the failing @wsj write a false editorial about me and let dummy @karlrove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper? 
.@karlrove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re china and tpp. this moron wasted $430 million on political campaigns and lost 100% 
we, as a country, either have borders or we don't. if we don't have borders, we don't have a country 
why wouldn't the @wsj call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong. no wonder it is doing poorly 
when and how are the dummies at the @wsj going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect editorial on me. i want smart trade deals. 
the @wsj editorial board is so wrong, so often. they got info from an incorrect story in another pub. why not watch and listen to debate. 
.@wsj editorial board should review my debate statement re china and t.p.p. and apologize. china not part but will get their way in later. 
today's @wsj editorial is wrong again. i know that china is not in the new t.p.p. trade deal but would come in latter through a back door. 
i will be interviewed on @mariabartiromo @foxbusiness at 7:30 
all seven on line polls, including drudge and time, with thousands of respondents, said i won the debate. @krauthammer said i was so, so. 

@borntobegop: @realdonaldtrump you will bring out more voters to vote for you than we've seen in any election great. 


will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 pm. 
i will be on @marklevinshow at 8pm tonight. tune in 
.@gerardtbaker gerard—wonderful job last night as moderator of the debate. i told many, “really smart and elegant.” 
i never said that china was in the bad tpp trade deal but that china would come in the back door at a later date. @cnn @foxbusiness 
just returned home from the great state of new hampshire. have made so many friends there special place 
happy veterans day. to those who have served, thank you for your special work. 

loved doing the debate...won drudge and all on line polls amazing evening, moderators did an outstanding job.

@jezzak: if the trump hotel honolulu is any reflection how you would be as president then i think the u.s will be in good hands thank you 
i will be interviewed by @gstephanopoulos on @gma at 7:00 a.m. there is much to talk about 







@jimmygould07: only one man has the appeal, nerve, commitment, ideas, & motivation. he's the icon, business tycoon, and lovable donaldtrump 
@burgettn: @ab1132 @realdonaldtrump it's the only way we can make america great again. 
@kniala: @realdonaldtrump exactly. marco has no accomplishments. 
@rm1792: @realdonaldtrump man, i love the where you spoke the truth about hillary. we have waited so long for someone to do this. 
@freedoms411: @wakeuppeoplesos @mitchellvii @cnn @abc @cbs it shouldn't be ignored, and i doubt it will be, carson will drop in polls. 
@teed_chris: @loyal2trump2016 @trumpalabama @foxnews look when you try to kill your mom,that's it for me ,no walking on water 
@kazmierskir: @realdonaldtrump @donaldjtrumpjr outstanding is obvious that jr. has much of his father's 'charisma' and intelligence 



marco rubio couldn't even respond properly to president obama's state of the union speech without pouring sweat & chugging water. he choked 
marco rubio is a total lightweight who i wouldn’t hire to run one of my smaller companies a highly overrated politician 

great job on @greta @donaldjtrumpjr. nobody could have done it better

@syoka68: @realdonaldtrump trump rocked snl 
@ccakul: @realdonaldtrump it was a great show 
@pizzapartyben: @realdonaldtrump we need you elected tomorrow 
@jackmarchione: @realdonaldtrump loved the show 


@redletter99: @realdonaldtrump thanks donald great show,when r u coming back to massachusetts? very soon 

@martydrinksbeer: @realdonaldtrump it was fantastic 


will be on @foxandfriends at 8:00 a.m. 
amazing evening at saturday night live 
i am at the saturday night live studio electricity all over the place. we will be doing a tweeting skit, so stay tuned 



@borntobegop: @realdonaldtrump you want them here legally and they want to be here legally 


@realcinders2: @realdonaldtrump use snl to tell hispanics you are for them , you want them to have jobs and be here legally great idea 









they are saying that tickets to tonight's saturday night live are the hardest to get in the history of this great show off to a good start 



saturday night live has some incredible things in store tonight. the great thing about playing myself is that it will be authentic enjoy 
.@robertgbeckel please thank your brother for his nice words on television. seems like a great guy and character @cnn 
@essygalloway: @realdonaldtrump @nbcsnl @sia i can't wait to watch snl tomorrow. a really big show 



would be nice if @jmartnyt learned how to read the polls before writing his next story. probably done on purpose, but not good reporting 
@billkristol has become a sad case. his magazine is failing badly, probably doesn't have long to go, and his predictions are always wrong 
@fbeadon: @realdonaldtrump don't let the keystone pipeline die. the us needs to be good neighbors with canada, and energy independent. 


so sad that obama rejected keystone pipeline. thousands of jobs, good for the environment, no downside 
happy birthday to the great @billygraham. he's done so many wonderful things, not the least of which is his fantastic family. i love billy 





@bigsampolkcoga: @govchristie @mikehuckabeegop @foxbusiness and they kept rand paul on the main stage. let's get huck and christie back. 

@borntobegop: @realdonaldtrump @robostop10 @politico how anyone could see him as president baffles me. lies and insane theories. 
@captainmark_: @robostop10 keep it comming trump people need to be warned about that carson figure who is not who they think 
getting ready for @nbcsnl commercial.pic.twitter.com/ashecyfbrv 


.@ajdelgado13 thank you so much for the nice words and support really enjoy listening to your ideas and thoughts. 
i think it would be a good idea—and fair—to include @govchristie & @mikehuckabeegop in the debate. both solid & good guys. @foxbusiness 
carson now admits his friend named bob, who he tried to stab (bob was saved by his belt buckle ), no longer exists as bob. wrong name 
with ben carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and pyramids built for grain storage don't people get it? 

florida ethics commission advocate comes down hard on rubio. so do two people who worked with him. said he used the wrong credit card sure. 
@rhinostate: .@realdonaldtrump @grundleman27 rubio is a manchurian candidate. people will own him if he ever became president. 



@rick_sa: @greta interesting presidential race; carson tries to beat his mom with a hammer, and @realdonaldtrump beats carson in the polls 
@deemcna: @foxnews silent majority did not try to kill their mothers, like ben carson, but wants america rebuilt by only one capable:trump 
a great honor to easily finish first in the @foxnews poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner 



@sandrajenners: i love to see the respect you have shown to your parents, siblings and children. proven respect and class needed in usa 
the carson story is either a total fabrication or, if true, even worse trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend 


@marklindsay78: @hanan_khan2 @realdonaldtrump poll numbers are higher then most think, no one is asking democrats if they are voting trump 
@teamspringsteen: @realdonaldtrump i just finished reading crippled america. it's a detailed blueprint to get america back on track. 
@nottaliberal: @realdonaldtrump @destiny @seanhannity no need, everyone knows jeb is full of blank. 
@curtismuddog: @destiny @seanhannity jeb's whole campaign is fueled by lies. just like his brother lied about iraq. bush dynasty=lies 
.@seanhannity should have corrected jeb bush when he said that i ran for president twice. never ran, merely considered running 

@lizzym420: @amrightnow @realdonaldtrump what other candidate begins to rival trump in his knowledge, breadth of issues, stamina? thanks 
@destiny: why didn't @seanhannity correct jeb when he said @realdonaldtrump has run 4 president 2x b4~jeb needs 2b corrected b/c he lied. 
@spiritofshiloh: carson has the worst health plan ever re: soc sec and medicare. @realdonaldtrump he wants to abolish medicare no way 
jeb bush just said about marco rubio, he's my friend pure political speak. why can't he be truthful and say disloyal guy, no friend 



just landed in new hampshire a very exciting morning planned 
isn't it terrible that @megynkelly used a poll not used before (i.b.d.) when i was down, but refuses to use it now when i am up? 



@lestudio1: donald trump crippled america the new book by @realdonaldtrump is best seller in the making. 
@svn2hd: @realdonaldtrump crippled america is a must read. so right. great job on another best seller. 

@sjavner: reading crippled america ....feeling love for our country first, in it's pages. that's why i stand with trump 
@seanhannity: @realdonaldtrump on sending 50 special ops forces troops to syria: this country needs to be less predictable.” 
@dougdwiley: @realdonaldtrump i can't wait to read your new book we are supporting you here in boise idaho 










marco rubio would keep barack obama’s executive order on amnesty intact. see article. cannot be president.http://www.breitbart.com/big government/2015/11/02/marco rubio jorge ramos will keep obamas first executive amnesty place legislative amnesty enacted/ … 
@lookercherry: @realdonaldtrump the polls are for the news cycle. trump is miles ahead and leaving all others in the dust, don't doubt me 
@realollietaylor: @realdonaldtrump @freedomr@oann trump is the only one who can make america great again. carson's sleepy, jeb low energy. 

.@charlesgkoch is looking for a new puppet after governor walker and jeb bush cratered. he now likes rubio next fail. 
@freedomrings22: @realdonaldtrump i trust @oann 's polls they are actually really fair and really balanced on all their news iowa lead 
@jayjohnsonlikes: @realdonaldtrump been here in line for two hours already. reading book while waiting. i'll see you at noon 

@freebird_pepper: @realdonaldtrump is the only candidate speaking on the horrible treatment our vets are getting and he has solutions 



i will be interviewed on @gma at 7:00 a.m. and @foxandfriends at 7:50. talking about my new book, out today, crippled america. 
@harpamystabler: @fs1 @realdonaldtrump @colincowherd this interview is great. 
@kingster73: @realdonaldtrump rubio is irresponsible on finances and doesn't show up for work who would hire him? not the american people 
@tdavistonya: @brucedhendrix @poetry4bitcoin nope. trump isn't taking 2 weeks off to promote his book. trump is donating all to charity 
@kemper34: @theherd @colincowherd @realdonaldtrump @fs1 great interview. ranks just above the @jimharbaugh49 interview. 
@thebrandonmckee: read all about the wollman deal and many other successful deals in the art of the deal by @realdonaldtrump 

@johndorlando1: @arizonaluke @realdonaldtrump @joetrippi @foxnews his crowds are huge...hard to think he is going to lose. 
@trumpfix: @meganena13 @robertew2945 agreed luisa. @realdonaldtrump will win this is what he does 
@ddietlin3: @colincowherd fantastic job with your interview with @realdonaldtrump today 

my interview with @jheil & @markhalperin at @wollmanrink airing at 5pm on @bpolitics.pic.twitter.com/qerqu7ceeh 

.@charlesmblow why don’t you use new polls instead of the single ancient national poll that was a tiny bit negative. dishonest reporting 

thank you carl higbie (former navy seal) for you support of my plan to straighten out the veterans administration a mess great job @kilmeade 


@taurus82409: @morning_joe donald trump is the absolute winner you heads try to talk around him, why, why??? go trump 
.@morning_joe: marco only won the debate in the minds of desperate people. i won every on line poll, even crazy @cnbc. marco good looking? 
sirius national news at 7:30 a.m. steve bannon. @breitbartnews 
@landmanmarius: @realdonaldtrump @robmont777 @strengthentheus @gop we accept the best. we want trump 
@damron88: @realdonaldtrump @borntobegop i sure in the hell hope so. trump please make this country great again. 
@truth_or_rumor: @realdonaldtrump it's not so much that iran made a good deal, it's that kerry and obama gave away the store. o.k. 

@henrythezebra: @realdonaldtrump america needs you to start your 8 year shift a bit early to start fixing this disaster. 


now that iran ripped us off by making one of the best deals of any kind in history, they have just moved to block any imports from the u.s. 
@borntobegop: @realdonaldtrump 9 years from now we will thank president trump for making us great again thank you 
i will be on sirius xm radio, national news show, at 7:30 a.m. (monday) hosted by the great steve bannon. @breitbartnews 

while in politics it is often smart to send out false messages, one thing is clear: that hillary does not want to run against trump. 

if jeb bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with marco in the debate. bad facts for marco if properly delivered 
marco rubio will not win. weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a lightweight . 
i told you in speeches months ago that jeb and marco do not like each other. marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to jeb as his mentor 
jeb's new slogan jeb can fix it . i never thought of jeb as a crook stupid message, the word fix is not a good one to use in politics 

further proof that gang of eight member marco rubio is weak on illegal immigration is paul singer's, mr. amnesty, endorsement.rubs can't win 
@bellicwolf: @and_is_w anyway, for me the most original costume was donald trump like president 

@n_r_mandela: @realdonaldtrump and you're still a negative loser and trump is still a positive winner. i'm black and proudly voting trump 


gov. john kasich has really failed on the campaign trail. i thought he would have been far more talented. he is just wasting time & money 
@suesabo: media wants a puppet.we want donald trump to make america great again, last chance to make america greathttps://twitter.com/aduanebrown/status/658015621515362304 … 





@katyturnbc: this is the most focused trump stump i've heard really drilling down on vets issues here in virginia. 
.@thehill john oliver had his people call to ask me to be on his very boring and low rated show. i said no thanks waste of time & energy 
few people know that @fortunemagazine is still in business. tell your writer alisa soloman that i left the apprentice to run for president 

@borderwall: floridian here i quit watching debates years ago & most tv except gator football until you decided to run for president 
@sean_in_nh: @realdonaldtrump @realollietaylor so true. in all previous debates, no one watched and they were cancelled 


@jodil792: @realdonaldtrump i wouldn't be watching at all honestly 
@antstacksgrieco: @realdonaldtrump you were great in it thanks 
@realollietaylor: @realdonaldtrump no one would have watched the debates if trump had not been in them 
@rketeltas: @realdonaldtrump has won all three debates and all that matters is that trump supporters know that & will vote trump thanks 
@shawnslawns4u: @terrykimk93 @wsj this coming election is the most important presidential election in my lifetime vote for trump 
@danlifting: @realdonaldtrump i wouldn't watch it at all if mr. trump was not on it. see u on your book signing on 11/3. trump all the way. 

no complaints but how many people would be watching these really dumb but record setting debates if i wasn't in them? interesting question 
@terrykimk93: @realdonaldtrump @wsj go trump go vote trump 
thank you james freeman of the @wsj for the very nice words. all polls said i won the debate except nbc (3rd). explain to daniel henninger 

support coach kennedy and his right, together with his young players, to pray on the football field. liberty institute just suspended him 

.@colincowherd said such nice things about me during the debate that i thought i'd do his show, @theherd, on monday (2:30pm est). 


@marshallfsmith: @lexingtonbobby @realdonaldtrump and its a glorious fall day in norfolk knock'em dead donald thanks 
@wavridr101: @realdonaldtrump do a flyover @nauticusnorfolk uss wisconsin cool idea, we will try 
the @wsj wall street journal loves to write badly about me. they better be careful or i will unleash big time on them. look forward to it 
lifting off right now for u.s.s. wisconsin in norfolk. see ya' 
i told you so @politico just lost it's top person. poor results and no money to pay him. if they were legit, they would be doing far better 
i am leaving for norfolk, virginia the great battleship u.s.s. wisconsin for a big rally and really big crowd. see you soon 
i see marco rubio just landed another billionaire to give big money to his superpac, which are total scams. marco must address him as sir 

black lives matter protesters totally disrupt hillary clinton event. she looked lost. this is not what we need with isis, china, russia etc. 
@dalva1616: so true vote @realdonaldtrump and have america greatness back to where it belongs : the united states of america. 

i am going to save medicare and medicaid, carson wants to abolish, and failing candidate gov. john kasich doesn't have a clue weak 
when candidate john kasich, on the @oreillyfactor, talked about dismantling medicare and medicaid, he was referring to ben carson. 


@jackdix03868724: arizona polls for democrats only say they would prefer donald trump over hillary clinton 60% 



@borntobegop: @realdonaldtrump you are always many steps ahead of the game thank you. 
@jimmcvey1: @eddiern @deusvultusmc @deadeyemadoc @smithsj1 trump is the closest thing to gen.patton that we will ever see again. cool 

@roadstarr1: @realdonaldtrump @govmikehuckabee @foxnews mike huckabee is a very nice gentleman and yes donald you raised wonderful children 
@smithsj1: @realdonaldtrump mr. trump do you swear to provide for, protect and care for our soldiers, including vets? yes, yes, yes 
.@govmikehuckabee great job on @foxnews tonight. thanks for your nice words about my children. class

@freestateyank: the only way anybody's gonna beat trump is being better than he is. ~@rushlimbaugh on @realdonaldtrump. 
thank you @charleshurt for the nice words on @seanhannity. i will win and make america great again 
loved doing the debate last night on @cnbc. check out all of the polls everyone agrees that harwood bombed 
wow, just heard really bad stuff about the failing @politico. how much longer will they be around? some very untalented reporters. 
my interview on @thisweekabc with @gstephanopoulos had a 40% ratings increase over same sunday last year. 20% over last week. 


join me tuesday, nov. 3rd at 12pm in trump tower nyc. i’ll be signing copies of my new book crippled america. don’t miss it 



@neraex: i'm not even american and i want to see @realdonaldtrump win a person like him is going to set a new standard for world leaders 

@skillethead58: @realdonaldtrump hell of a job 

@bentleyfortrump: @realdonaldtrump @drudge_report we need a wall not a rubio 

.@speakerryan congratulations and good luck you will do a great job for our wonderful u.s.a. 
@robertaritzen: @realdonaldtrump we support you and believe that your america's hope thanks. 
failing host @glennbeck, a mental basketcase, loves superpacs in other words, he wants your politicians totally controlled by lobbyists 




@mikeanddawnny: @seanmdav dipshit @johnjharwood lied debate always being set for 2 hours if not 4 @realdonaldtrump calling @cnbc out.

@agentvf: @realdonaldtrump stay strong and get ready for next debate. great job last night. 

@stevebashino: trump good for legal immigration, economy, defense, taxes, social security, medicare, 2nd amendment, and all americans. 
@derekcarlson: donaldtrump turned a $1 million loan into $10 billion. that's like you turning a $1,000 loan into $10 million. couldyoudoit? 

thank you to everybody for your wonderful comments on my debate performance it was a lot of fun today i will be speaking in reno, nevada. 
@8723g: one thing i learned from @realdonaldtrump : sometimes the best deals are the deals you never make we will have strong deal makers 
@atheistwwonka: @realdonaldtrump @jakistheman by the time you're done everyone will be wearing a trump tie 
@evdefuse: @realdonaldtrump they should just let you be president already, you're already leading in the polls. 
@jakistheman: @realdonaldtrump keep you're momentum until you win over the white house 

@truthinvest: @chrischristie @hillaryclinton good job for christie last night.maybe he will face her 8 yrs from now after @realdonaldtrump 

thank you @morningmika and @joenbc for all of your nice words and comments on the debate 


the money losing @politico is considered by many in the world of politics to be the dumbest and most slanted of the political sites. losers 


@sisters4evert: good night all supporters. great night mr @realdonaldtrump, you rocked the rocky mountains & the nation tonight 

@ngb6060: @realdonaldtrump showing why he should be our next president. tremendous debate. winning all the post debate polls. 





@barbaradestasio: @realdonaldtrump great debate, way to go 
@hyatt1942: @realdonaldtrump @piersmorgan we all voted for you tonight as winner of the debate.. 
thanks, @piersmorgan. you're great 


thanks everyone, they all said i won the debate. even won the @cnbc poll 

@jaxsiete: @realdonaldtrump love your sense of humor...lol your rallies are amazing. we're standing behind you 1000%:) @foxnews 
@cnbc poll total: trump 25.22 carson 19.78 rubio 9.67.... 
.@theeconomist poll, one of the most highly respected, was just released. wow, wait until the media digests these numbers won't be happy 


@vaporcon2015: @realdonaldtrump the liberals are terrified that you'll be the one to go against hillary. 
@cmrose111: @realdonaldtrump @cnbc get your polls straight. trump is going to win. he is the only one tough enough to run this country. 
@mozarttaig1: @cnbc is trying to drive down poll numbers to install carson who the establishment gop will promptly roll. win don win 
does anybody think that @cnbc will get their fictitious polling numbers corrected sometime prior to the start of the debate. sad 
@1barbara1: @realdonaldtrump @morning_joe @politico i watched the entire rally and trump was very well received the place was packed. 
.@morning_joe can you believe kasie hunt's poor and purposely inaccurate reporting on my great night and crowd in iowa. @politico is a scam 
.@cnbc continues to report fictious poll numbers. number one, based on every statistic, is trump (by a wide margin). they just can't say it 
after a great evening and packed auditorium in iowa, i am now in colorado looking forward to what i am sure will be a very unfair debate 

@jayknightjay: @realbencarson good morning. easy on each other & finish off the establishment guys. they hope you 2 will fight it out. true 



@2bigj: @realdonaldtrump a lot of people i know are voting trump in nc none have been polled your lead is bigger than anyone can imagine. 
@laura_damron: @foxnews @realdonaldtrump this hispanic woman believes trump has the brains & energy to make america great again . 
@rickst. how many msm outlets will carry a clip of @realdonaldtrump leaving the podium to enter a crowd & listen to the concerns of a vet? 


@fairy_tabibi: loved seeing @realdonaldtrump speak to the wounded warrior & his family.he has a caring heart and will take care of our vets 


@rketeltas: @realdonaldtrump at least the real frontrunner is actually campaigning in iowa and not on book tours. trump 2016 

@faagifts: @oann wtg, great job. u r the best pick out of all of the candidates & ohio knows this 2.that is why u r leading there too 
i am leaving for sioux city, iowa great event (rally). 


thank you @sahilkapur for the wonderful story.http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015 10 27/why donald trump could win the republican nomination … 

@rhatpatriot: @foxbusiness @realdonaldtrump why not post the other polls where trump has 40 percent and carson is in the teens? strange? 
@bawl: i agree @billkristol hasn't be right about anything in a very long time. shocking that @morning_joe gives him a platform. 
@jordandworaczyk: @drhawk12 @elvisknievil i'm voting for @realdonaldtrump too. thanks. 

@albertomarsano: @realdonaldtrump looking forward to seeing you in reno nevada this thursday nevada stands with you nice. 
@thejusticeengle: @realdonaldtrump i'm 18 years old from florida, and just registered to vote. you got my vote in the primaries thanks. 

@bobd746847: there shouldn't be a problem with this election. we the people finally have someone that speaks on our behalf. trump 2016 
@coloradojoe2001: how is any one taking carson seriously when he suspends his presidential campaign for a book signing tour? 
dopey @billkristol, who has lost all credibility with so many dumb statements and picks, said last week on @morning_joe that biden was in. 

all presidential candidates should immediately disavow their super pac’s. they're not only breaking the spirit of the law but the law itself 
re super pac scam: what the other candidates are doing is a disgrace. 
this whole super pac scam is very unfair to a person like me who has disavowed all pac's & is self funding. 

@hoosierclinger: good job @realdonaldtrump for badgering ford. why didnt potus or hillary care about those uaw jobs in ohio? 
@maria_heck: @robertsliardon @realdonaldtrump. the more i hear trump the more i like him 

ben carson wants to abolish medicare i want to save it and social security. 

leaving for new hampshire now. will be doing the @todayshow there, live at 7:00 a.m. new @cbsnews poll of new hampshire: trump 38 carson 12 

remember that carson, bush and rubio are very weak on illegal immigration. they will do nothing to stop it. our country will be overrun 
@rketeltas: @realdonaldtrump bush appears to be low on cash may need to do drop out or perhaps get a loan from hillary. 

@mmolina44: @realdonaldtrump @byronyork @cbsnews @cnn donald trump will be our next president of the united states. 

@jfgrcar: @realdonaldtrump gentle ben is no match for putin or if the truth be told even for hilary. usa needs a winner. 
do you think i will get credit for keeping ford in u.s. who cares, my supporters know the truth. think what can be done as president 
word is that ford motor, because of my constant badgering at packed events, is going to cancel their deal to go to mexico and stay in u.s. 


@thuglife602: @realdonaldtrump bad position for jeb, if his mommy, daddy and brother get involved the skeletons come back out of the closet 
@cospy8: @realdonaldtrump @byronyork @cbsnews @cnn way ahead in all the polls that matter. trump for president 




@tirolian2: @realdonaldtrump @byronyork @cbsnews @cnn # trump is unstoppable thank you. 
@concerningtimes: @jebbush needs to drop out your, hurting the republican cause . @realdonaldtrump is our choice 
@thatgirlflorida: @realdonaldtrump @byronyork @cbsnews @cnn florida loves trump we had a ball in jacksonville saturday 
.@byronyork great numbers from @cbsnews poll. also from abc washington post poll. thank you @cnn 
do you believe that @foxnews is still playing up the old iowa poll numbers and no mention of the abcwashington post or just out cbs results?

watch my interview on @cbsnews face the nation now and, also, the new cbs polls which, if good for me, the media won't report 

@ron_fournier: .@realdonaldtrump rightly denounces super pac driven campaign $ system. another example of how dc deserves this guy great 
@russia890: @cnnpolitics @realdonaldtrump trump is the smartest of all. my comment is non partisan. i heard everybody n im on trump side. 

big poll comes out today on face the nation at 10:30 on @cbsnews.

ben carson has never created a job in his life (well, maybe a nurse). i have created tens of thousands of jobs, it's what i do. 
i spell out some of the differences between ben carson and myself at 9:00 a.m. on @cnn @jaketapper. ben is very weak on illegal immigration. 
a big poll will be announced this morning on @cbsnews face the nation. i wonder if i do well if the press will report the results? doubt it 
@landmanmarius: @realdonaldtrump australia supports donald trump. please immigrate to australia and make aussie great as well. cute 

this is just not the right time for jeb bush. his campaign is in total disarray, too much staff being paid way too much money = u.s. govt.

@jaredchristophr: donald trump is the only person that can make this country great again @realdonaldtrump i fully agree 
@bane1349: they all want jobs and a bright future. they know donald trump is the one and only choice to make that a reality 


while jeb bush is cutting staff and salaries, after having paid ridiculous amounts of money, why did he pay so much in the first place? 

@hankcampbell: democrats seem to be more interested in donald trump than hillary clinton. 

.@jebbush is slashing campaign salaries, people making millions. if he can't manage his campaign, how can he manage our countries finances? 

.@jebbush is totally lost he spends too much time managing the bloated staff of his campaign & not enough talking about america's future. 


will be doing a sit down interview with @jaketapper @cnn on sunday morning at 9:00. tough questions and hopefully very good answers

@theratzpack: @svingali @foxnews @megynkelly i don't care if she jumps on the train .be gr8 if she were just fair and balanced 

@weaverinc31: the problem is @mittromney was a weak establishment candidate who couldn't even turn out the base. weak at best 
@vbonina: @conservecast @georgewill why does fox even talk to will? he is clueless and doesn't represent what our party is about. 
@crowebar_67: @megynkelly been boycotting her since 1st debate mr. trump and so have plenty of other decent people. ratings r going down 

@chefmama32: @realdonaldtrump good interview with chris chris even gave you a thumbs up for potus 
@conservecast: the definition of a pretentious establishment henchman is @georgewill . he is such a sourpuss, hates @realdonaldtrump 
best thing my supporters can do if you don't like the way @megynkelly and her puppets unfairly treat us is don't watch her show

fox news sunday with chris wallace will be re broadcast on @foxnews at 6:00 p.m. 

@kellmat2: @realdonaldtrump @rd_2008 @jebbush jeb is no conservative in my book. common core is a disaster. 
@rd_2008: @jebbush quit jeb quit. your poll is even lower than your apprentice rubio. @realdonaldtrump 
@marcosthejackal: @realdonaldtrump @d_seaman jebbush marcorubio: how could those two think they can compete with you. you are a legend. 
@tuvarkz: @realdonaldtrump can't stump the trump 

@american1st: @ofccadjust @anncoulter gw bush was open borders like @jebbush. terrorists can come across mexican border at will 
@pappenjazz: an incredibly strong interview of @realdonaldtrump @foxnewssunday, good response ic those @foxnews naysayers dissapating 
@undengel: @realdonaldtrump @anncoulter couldn't have said it, better... nothing fake about you, sir. 

@anncoulter: read this djt full p ad from 1989 and tell me donaldtrump is a johnny come lately fake conservative:pic.twitter.com/dbnic3miol 
@anncoulter:he's right. trump on 9/11 happening on bush's watch: with my immigration policy, i doubt those ppl wld have been in the country 
just reported by cnn that the trump halo effect caused a record shattering democratic debate rating of 15.3 million viewers. so true 
it's amazing that some of the dumbest people on television work for the wall street journal, in particular a real dope named charles lane 
@defendingtheusa: @realdonaldtrump @foxnews loved the brutal zinger against the wall street journal

@danlifting: @realdonaldtrump get a life george will. usa doesn't make anything anymore. trump will bring manufacturing back to usa 
i should release the sad and totally apologetic letter that penn @pennjillette hand delivered to me. minds would be changed very fast

@walterekurtzjr: @realdonaldtrump chris wallace: after my interview and listening to his answers, i think donald trump could be president 



does everyone remember @mittromney and his famous remarks about self deportation and 47% . he was done. i don't need his angry advice 
.@mittromney and his campaign manager should not be critical of candidates after they blew an election that should never have been lost 
.@mittromney can only speak negatively about my presidential chances because i have been openly hard on his terrible choke loss to obama 

.@foxnewssunday 
jeb, why did your brother attack and destabalize the middle east by attacking iraq when there were no weapons of mass destruction? bad info? 
this morning chris wallace has the best political show on television but that's only because i'm on it (kidding) have fun. 
jeb bush should stop trying to defend his brother and focus on his own shortcomings and how to fix them. also, rubio is hitting him hard 
on at 9:00a.m. or 10:00 a.m. (depending on your location) on fox is a tough but really good interview with chris wallace. enjoy

@myhealthcoach1: @noahgraycnn thank you police force for your efforts of protecting donald trump we love you for this, god bless you 

no @jebbush, you’re pathetic for saying nothing happened during your brother’s term when the world trade center was attacked and came down. 

.@jebbush, at the debate you said your brother kept us safe i wanted to be nice & did not mention the wtc came down during his watch, 9/11. 


rumor has it that the grubby head of failing @vanityfair magazine, sloppy graydon carter, is going to be fired or replaced very soon? 

nice story from @businessinsiderhttp://read.bi/1vvl5wu

.@erictrump was fantastic on @foxandfriends this morning. he may be my son but he is a special guy 
.@cnbc has just agreed that the debate will be two hours. fantastic news for all, especially the millions of people who will be watching 
@lance_combrink: @realdonaldtrump karl rove still thinks romney won. why is he still on tv? 
@hohummm: did you also hear megyn say carson is the front runner ...according so some polls ..tied in other polls outright lie hatred 
@rickstans1: donald, megyn kelly seeks ratings, not truth not much of a journalist. stay focused & make your own narrative. it's working 
every poll, time, drudge, slate and others, said i won both debates but heard megyn kelly had her two puppets say bad stuff. i don't watch 
.@marcthiessen is a failed bush speechwriter whose work was so bad that he has never been able to make a comeback. a third rate talent 

megyn kelly has two really dumb puppets, chris stirewalt & marc threaten (a bushy) who do exactly what she says. all polls say i won debates 
@redscarebot: @brandongordy1: @realdonaldtrump is what we millennials need. i used to support that socialist from vt, what a mistake. 
@bigmikeobrien: @erictrump @skyjones55 @greta @foxnews @oreillyfactor @carlrove is in the tank for bush we are tired of the establishment 

@davidaxelrod: .met @ivankatrump a few years back. donaldtrump is wise to enlist his daughter's help. she's a throughly impressive person. 
will be on @bloombergtv tomorrow with @sruhle. enjoy 

.@cnbc is pushing the @gop around by asking for extra time (and no criteria) in order to sell more commercials. 
the @gop should not agree to the ridiculous debate terms that @cnbc is asking unless there is a major benefit to the party.

even though i have the legal right to use steven tyler’s song, he asked me not to. have better one to take its place 
will be going to richmond, virginia today. big crowd see you there. 
the debate last night proved that hillary is running against the “b” team. she won’t be so lucky when it comes to me 


like her or not, hillary did what she had to do in the debate last night—get through it. her opponents were very gentle and soft 

@releafpen: dem debate message summary = more free handouts. they will be voting in droves. we need to get out and vote trump big time

@mcowgerfl: @realdonaldtrump thank you for always remembering america's veterans 


@jtrink97: @hell0therelydia @realdonaldtrump his commentary is making an otherwise shitty night outstanding thanks. 
@obamatax: after @hillaryclinton poor performance, waffling in debates, @teamsters14 should support @realdonaldtrump 

sanders said only black lives matter wow hillary did not answer question 
@i_am__tyler: i can't wait for @realdonaldtrump to debate one of these clowns all are so weak 

@ts01171980: @foxnews @realdonaldtrump isn't on the stage, turning this garbage off 

@realninjetta: @realdonaldtrump @ingrahamangle why did hillary get to skate past the do black lives matter anderson let her off hook 
@julieruot: i want a president who believes all lives matter and that is why we need @realdonaldtrump. 
sorry, there is no star on the stage tonight 
good move by bernie s. 
the hardest thing clinton has to do is defend her bad decision making including iraq vote, e mails etc. 
all are very scripted and rehearsed, two (at least) should not be on the stage. 
@achilarre: i couldn't even imagine the bloodbath that would ensue if the @realdonaldtrump debated any one of these five jabronis 

@mikerichterp: @realdonaldtrump i joined twitter tonight just to hear mr.trump tweet about this silly debate. 
@iamnewhere: webb is trying to be @realdonaldtrump and its not working. he is not doing well

@jennasnowy69: @realdonaldtrump why is webb there?? 

@juliatock: @realdonaldtrump sure you are laughing listening to these 5 try and explain how business and the economy works. scary 
@laurenda123: @realdonaldtrump i think @jebbush and @marcorubio are supposed to be on this stage 

@rjdicksii: @realdonaldtrump. these cats are like bad used car salesmen. 

@maxxgadog: @lindasuhler @realdonaldtrump if you got rid of commercials you would have nothing worth watching 

o'malley, as former mayor of baltimore, has very little chance. 
can anyone imagine chafee as president? no way. 
@tr3s3can: @realdonaldtrump @realdonaldtrump make america great again would not even watch dem debate except donald is tweeting about it 
@amd9890: .@realdonaldtrump was right...#demdebate is boring these ppl are so scripted so far 

@michaeltribunel: @realdonaldtrump imagine chafey standing up to putin 

@0nonsense: @realdonaldtrump good luck commenting on this snooze fest, i'm out.

@hapearce1: @realdonaldtrump they need to take the debate slow, a lot of low energy on the stage tonight. i hope not 
@streckerjosh: the hillary love fest on cnn is ridiculous. i feel bad for the other candidates...especially the non criminal ones. 
@xai7126: @greta i'd rather see @realdonaldtrump be the debate moderator 
should be interesting but too bad the three guys at《1% will be taking up so much time but who knows, maybe a star will be born (unlikely) 
@elvinichols: will @cnn be tough as they were with @realdonaldtrump ? no way, they will want to be soooo nice 

@007llisav: @cnn @realdonaldtrump @cnnpolitics can't wait for his insightful & intelligent tweets. you sound like a very smart person

the arrogant young woman who questioned me in such a nasty fashion at no labels yesterday was a jeb staffer how can he beat russia & china? 
sheldon adelson is looking to give big dollars to rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. i agree 




someone should inform @cnn that, despite spending millions of $'s on graphics, it is not the democratic debate, rather the democrat (s) d 
at the request of many, and even though i expect it to be a very boring two hours, i will be covering the democrat debate live on twitter

leaving soon after a great time in new hampshire, a truly special place 
great, everyone is saying i did much better on @60minutes last week than president obama did tonight. i agree 
president obama was terrible on @60minutes tonight. he said climate change is the most important thing, not all of the current disasters 


@thefix: tuesday's democratic debate is missing just one thing: donald trump. true, can you think of anyone who wants to watch? 
i will be on face the nation (cbs) today at 10:30 a.m. and media buzz (fox news) at 11:00 a.m. enjoy

just got back from georgia. the crowds and love for u.s. was so amazing we all had a great day together will be back soon 
little barry diller, who lost a fortune on newsweek and daily beast, only writes badly about me. he is a sad and pathetic figure. lives lie 

with the fantastic ratings last weekend, @meetthepress & @thisweekabc, i think it’s only fair that i go on @foxnewssunday w/ chris wallace. 
will be interviewed on @facethenation with @jdickerson tomorrow at 10:30am est. enjoy 

.@thisweekabc with @gstephanopoulos had fantastic numbers last sunday trump interview. nice 

.@chucktodd just informed us that my interview last week on @meetthepress was their highest rated show in 4 years. congrats 
i'm leading big in every poll and we are going to win remember, trump never gives up

heading to a packed house in waterloo, iowa will celebrate today's great poll numbers together. see you soon 
if stuart stevens' book is as bad as his horrible political advice to mitt romney, don't waste your money. arrogant guy but a zero

rubio is totally owned by the lobbyists and special interests. a lightweight senator with the worst voting record in senate. lazy 
@kissmeandrocco: @realdonaldtrump who ever thinks donald trump is a bad person u just don't want a good country thank you. 
just read that trump has the largest (and i add most enthusiastic) crowds. tonight i will be in new hampshire the place will be packed 
i watched lightweight senator marco rubio, who is all talk and no action, defend his weak position on illegal immigration. pathetic 

carl icahn said this about me: i think at this moment in time, he’s the only candidate that speaks out about the country’s problems. 
definitely watch @carl_c_icahn ‘s ‘danger ahead’. very insightful, particularly on how corp inversions hurt america:http://www.carlicahn.com  
i hope when rand paul gets out of the race—he is at 1% his supporters come over to me. i will do a much better job for them. 
prediction: rand paul has been driven out of the race by my statements about him he will announce soon. 1%

@jodil792: @defendingtheusa @america_trump @60minutes thats exactly what i thought. we haven't had great leader since reagan&now trump 
@yang_karl: all scott pelley did by being disrespectful was make it easier to make up my mind who to vote for and that will be trump. 

@jennaleeusa: when asked why he has his own magazine covers on his walls @realdonaldtrump replies: it's cheaper than wall paper... ha 
@skyeshepard: trump went way up in my 'poll' when he said he'd take money from what us is giving 2 other countries 2 save social security 
@apipwhisperer: @markpavelich @gentlemanirish @60minutes excellent watching putin's brilliance and trump's. @cbs i loved the interviews.

@theintellect111: @realdonaldtrump mr trump please do not give in.you are changing history. we need you as our next leader, its your time 
marco rubio is a member of the gang of eight or, very weak on stopping illegal immigration. only changed when poll numbers crashed. 

@taurus82409: @cbs @60minutes look forward to it, donald. you are doing great please keep up the fight, many of us are behind you 100% 
lightweight senator marco rubio is very weak on immigration, knows nothing about finance and would be incapable of making great trade deals 
@realdonaldtrump: i will be on @cbs @60minutes this sunday. a great honor hope you enjoy it. 
@vote_trump: think about it. when's the last time a prez actually did what he said? trump does what he says. will be greatest prez ever

.....ahead of schedule and under budget will be in oklahoma tonight 
great reception in d.c. at the values voter summit. now checking on my job at the old post office... 
@rketeltas: @joemarzocco waiting for the biased media to write about the 30,000 carly fired as a failed ceo. america is for trump 
.@megynkelly, the @foxnews poll said very plainly i came in second in the debate. all others, time, drudge, slate etc. said i came in 1st. 

@yayala19: @marcorubio what the lobbyists, the media and career politicians will do next to try to stop trump? silent majority is back 
just watched @marcorubio on television. just another all talk, no action, politician. truly doesn't have a clue worst voting record in sen. 
@yayala19: @politico when the other candidates are talking politics trump is talking solutions. he is the most talented candidate. 

the failing @politico news outlet, which i hear is losing lots of money, is really dishonest 
.@politico, which is not read or respected by many, may be the most dishonest of the media outlets and that is saying something.

incompetent @richlowry lost it tonight on @foxnews. he should not be allowed on tv and the fcc should fine him 

.@foxnews has been treating me very unfairly & i have therefore decided that i won't be doing any more fox shows for the foreseeable future. 

headline reads rubio passes bush in florida poll unfair, because trump destroys them both trump 31.5%, rubio 19.2%, bush 11.3% 
.@juliinkster congratulations on your great win what a captain, what a champion 


i will be the featured guest on the season opener of @60minutes this sunday. there certainly is plenty to talk about 
just remember, the birther movement was started by hillary clinton in 2008. she was all in 
i think @megynkelly should take another eleven day unscheduled vacation. 
do you ever notice that lightweight @megynkelly constantly goes after me but when i hit back it is totally sexist. she is highly overrated 
senator marco amnesty rubio, who has worst voting record in senate, just hit me on national security but i said don't go into iraq. vision

.@oreillyfactor, why don't you have some knowledgeable talking heads on your show for a change instead of the same old trump haters. boring 
.@oreillyfactor was very negative to me in refusing to to post the great polls that came out today including nbc. @foxnews not good for me 
@alivelutheran: @todayshow touts cnn polls instead of their own of course, the nbc one shows him much higher. trump corrects them

@paulkdebra: @todayshow @realdonaldtrump i totally support you you have this ga. girl's vote

@saijosaijo75: @realdonaldtrump thank you for your personal and financial sacrifices to make america great again 
carly fiorina did such a horrible job at lucent and hp, virtually destroying both companies, that she never got another ceo job offer pres. 
we are going to win and make america great again, maybe better than ever before 
i am attracting the biggest crowds, by far, and the best poll numbers, also by far. much of the media is totally dishonest. so sad 
i have been leading big in all polls, with two more today, @nbc and @cnn. the nbc poll is more than double next, at 29%. fiorina has 11%. 
there is no way that carly fiorina can become the republican nominee or win against the dems. boxer killed her for senate in california 
i will be on @meetthepress at 10:30. @nbc will be releasing their new poll numbers. based on the debate results, i should do well who knows? 





on my way to iowa. will be landing in des moines in two hours. see ya 
christians need support in our country (and around the world), their religious liberty is at stake obama has been horrible, i will be great 
if i would have challenged the man, the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech. a no win situation 
if someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president, do you really think he would come to my rescue? no chance 
this is the first time in my life that i have caused controversy by not saying something. 
am i morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? i don't think so 


thank you.https://twitter.com/mrsshively01/status/644952386847551488 …

will be interviewed tonight by @seanhannity on @foxnews at 10 pm. enjoy 


just announced that in the history of @cnn, last night’s debate was its highest rated ever. will they send me flowers & a thank you note? 




thank you to tom brady, coach ditka, coach bobby knight and all of the many champions that have been so supportive 

will be heading over to the debate soon. can you believe @cnn is milking it for almost 3 hours? too long, too many people on stage 

@skulls2001: we are a cuban family from miami florida and would love very much to work on your political campaing here in miami. great. 

@chriscoxb2b: @realdonaldtrump donald...keep pushing...the nation needs a real leader.

@97musick: @ac360 @cnn the sold to lobbyists candidates are wasting their money. on the border and immigration, trump will win. 
i hope arnold s. does well with the apprentice because he is a nice guy and also, because i get a big percentage of the profits 
just finished the wonderful event on the u.s.s. iowa. veterans for a strong america endorsed me. such a great honor, thank you 
.@rushlimbaugh rush, i am in la inspecting property (big job creator) & listening to you. you are truly fantastic thanks 
the polls are really looking good—#1 everywhere despite all lobbyist & special interest $ being spent against me. i’m turning down millions. 
everyone is talking about the incredible event we had in dallas last night. spectacular crowd & arena thank you @mcuban. 
.@club4growth asked me for $1 million. i said no. now falsely advertising that i will raise taxes. i’ll lower big league for middle class. 
my plan will lower taxes for our country, not raise them. phony @club4growth says i will raise taxes—just another lie. 
little respected club for growth asked me for $1,000,000 i said no . now they are spending lobbyist and special interest money on ads 
am now in l.a. will be going to the u.s.s. iowa at 5:30 p.m. to speak to our great veterans and other friends 
our vets are treated like 3rd class citizens. enough join me & @v4sa on @ussiowa at la waterfront to hear my plan for vets & the military 
loved dallas and the tremendous crowd last night. will be back 
i will rebuild the military, take care of vets and make the world respect the us again join me today. info:http://www.vetstickets.com  

@sandraatwood10: @risetoflyy @realdonaldtrump fabulous donald. so proud of u keep up gd work @foxnews @cnn @rushlimbaugh 
speech in dallas went really well. big and wonderful crowd. just arrived in l.a. big day tomorrow 




my opponents big bosses lobbyists and donors are trying to do damage. they will fail money down the drain 

to all my fans, sorry i couldn’t do the apprentice any longer—but equal time (presidential run) prohibits me from doing so. love 
congrats to my friend @schwarzenegger who is doing next season’s celebrity apprentice. he'll be great & will raise lots of $ for charity. 
my honor, thank you.https://twitter.com/momfullofhope/status/641623583761022976 … 
@doctr__wang @cnn nice i love how trump has a way of putting people on the spot. i wonder what cnn will do. the veterans appreciate it 
why is someone like george pataki, who did a terrible job as governor of n.y. and registers zero in the polls, allowed on the debate stage? 




@daveinkeno: mr. trump, sir, this country is, and has been, on a path of self destruction and needs you to make america great again 
@joeearle: @pistol044 there's only one i'll never support: @realdonaldtrump 
@edward1:trump knows how to get things done. he has guts to say what needs to be said. he'll deal with putin more effectively than anyone. 


i am having a great time in iowa at jack trice stadium unbelievable people. 
too many people on stage for debate. @randpaul at 11th, with 2% in @realclearnews, shouldn't be allowed to participate. 
i truly understood the appeal of ron paul, but his son, @randpaul, didn't get the right gene. 
lightweight senator @randpaul should focus on trying to get elected in kentucky a great state which is embarrassed by him.

just purchased nbc’s half of the miss universe organization and settled all lawsuits against them. now own 100% stay tuned 
let’s all take a moment to remember all of the heroes from a very tragic day that we cannot let happen again 
oh wow, lightweight governor @bobbyjindal, who is registered at less than 1 percent in the polls, just mocked my hair. so original 
also, tomorrow night i will be going to boone and ames. really look forward to seeing all of my friends in iowa. 

i will be on the tonight show with jimmy fallon tonight at 11:30. should be fun @jimmyfallon 
.... i only respond to people that register more than 1% in the polls. i never thought he had a chance and i’ve been proven right. 
bobby jindal did not make the debate stage and therefore i have never met him…. 

i'll be on @greta on the record tonight at 7 pm 
wow, i am ahead of the field with evangelicals (am so proud of this) and virtually every other group, and ben carson just took a swipe at me 
i had a great day in d.c. even though the subject was an unpleasant one, the horrible iran nuke deal. amazing crowd and enthusiasm 
man did jeb throw his brother under the bus last night on @colbertlateshow . probably true, but not nice 


see you in d.c. tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. at the capitol to protest the horribly negotiated deal with iran. really sad 

@christa_dorsett: @realdonaldtrump we want trump america needs him desperately 
@chris0u24: @realdonaldtrump i've just lost hope mr trump. hope you put america back the way it was 

will be on bill o'reilly @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 pm. enjoy 
a great honor to receive polling numbers like these. record setting african american (25%) & hispanic numbers (31%).http://www.theamericanmirror.com/shock poll trump receives 25 of black vote in general election matchup/ … 

jeb’s policies in florida helped lead to its almost total collapse. right after he left he went to work for lehman brothers—wow 
the lobbyists & special interests have just put out an ad for jeb which hits me just a little but is very false 
i’m self funding my campaign but lobbyists & special interests for jeb & others are starting to do big ads—desperate don’t believe them. 

thank you @ingrahamangle for your strength & wonderful words last night on @foxnews, but @karlrove is easy to beat 
wow such nice words from robert redford on my running for president. thank you, robert.pic.twitter.com/tpv3w18bw6 
tomorrow in dc: 1 pm west front lawn of the capitol. not even believable that we would do this deal with iran. 
look forward to being in dc tomorrow—big crowd expected for our protest against the truly stupid nuclear deal we are making with iran. 
looking forward to being with @sentedcruz at our big rally in d.c. on wednesday (1:00 p.m. at the capitol) to protest insane iran nuke deal 
both washington d.c. and dallas are turning out to be really big events. d.c. is protest of incompetent iran deal and dallas is big speech 
remember, i'll see you in d.c. at the capitol building on wednesday at 1:00 o'clock. then dallas on sept.14 at 6:00 p.m. american air center 
@douglasmaher: @realdonaldtrump @timenout @surveyusa looking forward to seeing you in dallas and voting for you. great 
@georgeokc: @realdonaldtrump @libertyladyusa for my mind, do whatever you think is right, you have nothing to prove, just save our nation.

@soz58: @realdonaldtrump @bob_ewashington @club4growth it's good to show the public such things,a lot of nerve to ask for a million dollars 

@seanbolza: sure hope you will do great things. you are giving us something to look forward to, and make america great again. go trump 
@jackson3pack: @realdonaldtrump @bob_ewashington @club4growth wow. so disengenuos in asking for a million dollars like its no big deal. 
@boobdex: @realdonaldtrump @bob_ewashington @club4growth wow i didn't know it was that unprofessional. 

@broewads: @realdonaldtrump @club4growth they are all just phony cronies. keep up the real deal mr. trump you are the man. 
@1ns1de_j9b: @realdonaldtrump @club4growth borderline extortion scam. they would have used your $1m to extract donations from others 
@deanallen12: @club4growth club4growth will do anything for a handout just like every other politician running... pay to say organization 


@cadigirl13: @realdonaldtrump you are our only hope keep strong mr.trump thank you. 
.@club4growth should release the letter they sent me asking for $1,000,000. when i said no, they came out against me. a scam operation? 
@jasonusmc2017: @blayne_troy @realdonaldtrump: he was right when he called obama the 5 for 1 president. 5 terrorist for one no good traitor 

@samsteel10: @shook_stephanie @slone as long as we can stay strong and give @realdonaldtrump our support. he's the leader. 
i will be in washington d.c. on wednesday,1 p.m.,in front of the capitol, to protest the horrible and incompetent deal being made with iran. 
the dallas event on september 14 at 6:00 p.m. at the american airlines center looks like it will be a giant success. tickets are going fast 
our country needs a president with great leadership skills and vision, not someone like hillary or barack, neither of which has a clue 
the phony club for growth, which asked me in writing for $1,000,000 (i said no), is now wanting to do negative ads on me. total hypocrites 





the hedge fund guys (gals) have to pay higher taxes asap. they are paying practically nothing. we must reduce taxes for the middle class 
by self funding my campaign, i am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists. i am only working for the people of the u.s. 
remember that i am self funding my campaign. hillary, jeb and the rest are spending special interest and lobbyist money.100% controlled 
hillary said such nasty things about me, read directly off her teleprompter...but there was no emotion, no truth. just can't read speeches 
hillary clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter i have ever seen. in fact, it wasn't even see through glass, it was black 
saudi arabia was vehemently against the iran nuclear deal. then today they embraced it. what happened? what did we give them to endorse? 
wow, the dallas event in two weeks looks like a big winner get your tickets (american airlines center) fast 
just announced that because of trump , advertising rates for debate on @cnn are going from $5000 to $200,000, a 4000% increase.pay charity? 
why would a very low ratings radio talk show host like hugh hewitt be doing the next debate on @cnn. he is just a 3rd rate gotcha guy 
very low ratings radio host hugh hewitt asked me about suleiman, abu bake al baghdad, hassan nasrallah and more typical gotcha questions 
the dallas event in two weeks, at the american airlines center, is filling up fast. get your tickets fast, before it is too late 
.@meghanmccain was terrible on @thefive yesterday. angry and obnoxious, she will never make it on t.v. @foxnews can do so much better 

so nice, thank you laura.https://twitter.com/ingrahamangle/status/639797662427017216 …

congratulations to tom brady on yet another great victory tom is my friend and a total winner 
the deal with iran will go down as one of the most incompetent ever made. the u.s. lost on virtually every point. we just don't win anymore 

.@brithume, i am in first place by a lot in all polls, tied for first place with ben carson in one iowa poll. i thought you knew this thanks 


.@kevinolearytv great job on @foxandfriends this morning. you tell it like it is also, thx for the nice mention. your book sounds great 


will be interviewed on @gma this morning at 7:00. thanks for the great poll results 


@lbabcock2: @oreillyfactor @foxnews i have always wondered why fox kept rove on after his disastrous election predictions. he is a joke 
@gulfportedd: @realdonaldtrump jeb bush couldn't shine mr trumps shoes...give me a break. bushes are so over... 

when i intelligently turned down the club for growth crazy request for $1,000,000, they got nasty.what a waste of money that would have been 
the president of the pathetic club for growth came to my office in n.y.c. and asked for a ridiculous $1,000,000 contribution. i said no way 


every poll has me winning big.if you listen to dopey karl rove, a trump hater, on @oreillyfactor, you would think i'm doing poorly. @foxnews 
why does @oreillyfactor and @foxnews always have karl rove on. he spent $430 million and lost all races. a dope who said romney won election 
i’m turning down millions of dollars of campaign contributions—feel totally stupid doing so, but hope it is appreciated by the voters. 
many super pacs, funded by groups that want total control over their candidate, are being formed to “attack” trump. remember when u see them 

congrats everyone we topped 4 million today on twitter and heading up fast 
while millions are being spent against me in attack ads, they are paid for by the “bosses” and “owners” of candidates. i am self funding. 
jeb is spending millions of dollars on “hit” ads funded by lobbyists & special interests. bad system. 
yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign. will jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me? 

the just released public policy polling (ppp national result) is the best yet. make america great again 
@highwayhopper66: @conniemackiv @00patriot my wife and i are both voting for trump in florida over our previous governor period thank you 

just out new ppp national poll has me in first place by a wide margin at 29%. i wonder why only @foxnews has not reported this? too bad 
150 clinton e mails still contain classified information. more sensitive when she was sec.of state. this is a very big deal. 
president obama wants to change the name of mt. mckinley to denali after more than 100 years. great insult to ohio. i will change back 
very proud of trump int'l golf links in aberdeen, scotland. just got the five star award from @visitscotnewshttps://twitter.com/visitscotnews/status/636834419270139904 …

another good poll result in the great state of sc. trump at 30%. carson at 15% and bush at 9%.http://politicalwire.com/2015/08/25/trump holds big lead in south carolina/ … 
congrats @lindseygrahamsc. you just got 4 points in your home state of sc—far better than zero nationally. you’re only 26 pts behind me. 
@linda_lcarson: @realdonaldtrump rubio and bush cant say wall. i guess it is not pc. just like obama cant say islamic terrorists 
@asa_patriot: @realdonaldtrump @patrickstinard @megynkelly i could not agree more i now flip to other channels at 9:00pm 
@ragefelix: @governorpataki ... i lived in ny when tacky pataki was gov... he was a total disaster for the people of new york 
@dlund22226523: gov. scott walker has ran wisconsin's economy into the ground. how dare he criticize you. you would fire him in a second. 
@ibemoshing: no hope for jeb bush anymore, @realdonaldtrump has been on fire really hope he can get the win and fix this country 
.@governorpataki did a terrible job as governor of new york. if he ran again, he would have lost in a landslide. he and graham zero in polls 
jeb bush just talked about my border proposal to build a fence. it's not a fence, jeb, it's a wall, and there's a big difference 
asians are very offended that jeb said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics. a mess 
in a clumsy move to get out of his anchor babies dilemma, where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it, he blamed asians 
jeb bush never uses his last name on advertising, signage, materials etc. is he ashamed of the name bush? a pretty sad situation. go jeb 
@patrickstinard: @megynkelly kelly file was much better without megyn kelly. her replacement while she was out on vacation was much better 
@youngyoung54: @jerihyatt @megynkelly @jebbush so true. jeb bush is crazy, who cares that he speaks mexican, this is america, english 
@barbavh: @realdonaldtrump @megynkelly ordered my trump banner today. can't wait 

@adriannamarie: @realdonaldtrump people always take cheap shots at you,they can't handle the truth.you tell it like it is.they're cowards. 
@jdwarren12: @realdonaldtrump mr trump i appreciate you and your honesty sir thank you. 
@toneantone96: @realdonaldtrump no man or women on this planet can give us back america with the exception of @realdonaldtrump leadership 

@mstanish53: @realdonaldtrump @megynkelly the bimbo back in town . i hope not for long . 
@mikeraj7: @megynkelly show has become a opinion show. leading questions, stirrwalt and thiessen, used, fair and balanced, not 
@swamp_bug: @seanhannity cruz is my second/third choice. carson is also a good man. i look at it as war, so my choice is trump. 
@bigpaulfla: @realdonaldtrump she has come back looking like nancy grace 
@colehudson68: @megynkelly @foxnews @theblaze @greta @oreillyfactor megyn needs to go back on vacation. what a waste of an hour on fox. 
i liked the kelly file much better without @megynkelly. perhaps she could take another eleven day unscheduled vacation 
.@megynkelly must have had a terrible vacation, she is really off her game. was afraid to confront dr. cornel west. no clue on immigration 
@jerihyatt: @megynkelly @jebbush @realdonaldtrump pffffffttttt we need to do something about illegals who get more than our vets 

via int'l business times: jeb bush got $1.3m job at lehman after florida shifted pension cash to bank.http://www.ibtimes.com/election 2016 jeb bush got 13m job lehman after florida shifted pension cash bank 2059224 …

@glendabelle_11 @foxnewsinsider @foxandfriends @realdonaldtrump trump supporters volunteer ,contribute, assist campaign etc .we need trump 
@zephyrusmatrix: will you finally get respect for predicting u.s. concerns even weeks before disaster strikes.the country needs a visionary 
markets are crashing all caused by poor planning and allowing china and asia to dictate the agenda. this could get very messy vote trump. 

as i have long stated, we are so tied in with china and asia that their markets are now taking the u.s. market down. get smart u.s.a. 
new reuters poll just came out and has me at 32%, highest number yet.the silent majority is back and we will make america great again 
the last thing we need is another bush in the white house. would be the same old thing (remember read my lips, no more taxes ). greatness 
jeb bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body. jeb just can't get it right 
jeb bush is weak on illegal immigration, in favor of common core, bad on women's health issues and thinks the iraq war was a good thing. 
now that i started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border, most other candidates are finally speaking up. just politicians 

how is bernie sanders going to defend our country if he can't even defend his own microphone? very sad 
thank you to the @washingtonpost for the accurate and very discriptive story on my speech in alabama last night. it was a great evening 
i had 15,000 people in phoenix but @politico said the rooms capacity is just over 2000. but said bernie sanders had 11,000 in same room. 
.@politico covers me more inaccurately than any other media source, and that is saying something. they go out of their way to distort truth 
@dojiedojie: @realdonaldtrump keep talking donald....the people want to hear it loud and clear 

alabama was great last night, amazing people. 30,000 folks was largest crowd of political season. nice 
.@jessebwatters, you did a great job hosting @oreillyfactor. everybody loved it thank you for the nice words. 

dow dives more than 500 points down 9% from high. be careful 
leaving for mobile, alabama, right now can't be late 
boston incident is terrible. we need energy and passion, but we must treat each other with respect. i would never condone violence. 



how crazy 7.5% of all births in u.s. are to illegal immigrants, over 300,000 babies per year. this must stop. unaffordable and not right 
jeb bush signed memo saying not to use the term anchor babies, offensive. now he wants to use it because i use it. stay true to yourself 
alabama will shine tomorrow. it will be a big and glorious day 
we are going to make our country so strong again, so great again. no more ripping off the united states. we will make america great again 
@2ndvoter: @stevehuang68 agree. one of the things that is good abt @realdonaldtrump is he's forcing others out of status quo politicking. 
@mattyjack33: @tomllamasabc so refreshing to have someone call out these left wingers posing as journalists. keep it up trump 
.@wntonight please correct your story tonight. the public is fed up with bad reporting for the sake of sensationalizing something 
.@tomllamasabc cannot report the news truthfully. why not apologize for your fraudulent story on world news tonight.gang members & criminals 
@abcpolitics must apologize. my statement we're going to get them out so fast, so quick applied to hard core criminals & gang members. lie

@joeweissnmb @realdonaldtrump @michaelcohen212 walker & bush want to be like trump. my mom88 they sound like boys compared to trump. 

if i am elected president i will immediately approve the keystone xl pipeline. no impact on environment & lots of jobs for u.s. 
@johnberman two explanations on @realdonaldtrump that seem no longer sufficient: 1) it's early. 2) it is all a media creation. 
.@jasondhorowitz i am very proud of my sister, your story was terrific. thank you so much. 

when foreigners attend our great colleges & want to stay in the u.s., they should not be thrown out of our country. 
i want talented people to come into this country—to work hard and to become citizens. silicon valley needs engineers, etc. 


listening to @rushlimbaugh on way back to jury duty. fantastic show, terrific guy 
why does @foxnews keep george will as a talking head? wrong on so many subjects 
@ruizseferino: @paulfincher2 please have mercy on all veterans. all we wished to do is serve a county who serves us not. trump for pres 
@nobamadotcom: an fyi to all the donaldtrump haters: we've won. most admit trump can win. and @georgewill & @krauthammer watch and learn 
@bannermanjack: rush is on fire today he really does have his finger on the pulse. the @realdonaldtrump shamers can't win against el rushbo 
@paulfincher2: i truly believe @realdonaldtrump is america's best choice to get our economy back on course & create needed jobs. 

@laura_winkker: @realdonaldtrump and its funny how fox news doesn't really get it love you mr. trump 
@1776pirate: @lindseygrahamsc @washtimes @madisongesiotto agreed. we need @realdonaldtrump as president asap. 

@kndetweiler: @hrkbenowen @thetimes @realdonaldtrump just released immigration plan is superior to everyone else's. including cruz. 

i really enjoyed being at the iowa state fair. the crowds, love and enthusiasm is something i will never forget. 
.@nicolledwallace your father is a brilliant man with wonderful sense therefore, you must be good 

@javonniandjeno: @realdonaldtrump @ap @nbc donald trump is clint eastwood, the perfect hero not scared of american terrorists. vote trump 
just got back from the iowa state fair. record crowds, phenomenal people. thank you iowa, i will never let you down 

in the plane heading to iowa state fair. will be great fun. hopefully giving helicopter rides to some of the kids. 
making speech tonight in new hampshire leaving now. fantastic people, fantastic crowd 
.@ap and @huffingtonpost should change their fraudulent story to say that i dropped @nbc & the apprentice to run for president 
people don’t understand that i left the apprentice to run for pres—the apprentice did not leave me. bob greenblatt & folks @nbc were great 






@mikerotondo86 only trump can bring us back from 20 trillion in debt... he's the only one with the experience and skill set to do so. 
will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight for the full hour. hope you enjoy it and, more importantly, hope you agree 

@pokeyisme1971: @realdonaldtrump @ericbolling @oreillyfactor why are people scared of someone who wants to fix a broken system trump 2016 

.@sentedcruz had a very good debate, far better than rand paul. 
.@ericbolling you can do much better than you did tonight on @oreillyfactor. better luck tomorrow 
why is @randpaul allowed to take advantage of the people of kentucky by running for senator and pres. why should kentucky be back up plan? 
we must stop the crime and killing machine that is illegal immigration. rampant problems will only get worse. take back our country 

@roy_propsner: @realdonaldtrump ...don't give up, don't surrender your 3rd party option 
truly weird senator rand paul of kentucky reminds me of a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain. he was terrible at debate 
again, illegal immigrant is charged with the fatal bludgeoning of a wonderful and loved 64 year old woman. get them out and build a wall 
.@katrinacampins thank you so much for the wonderful statements you made about me on tv. also, keep up the great work

wonderful frank gifford has just passed away at age 84. he was my friend and a truly great guy warmest condolences to family. 
it amazes me that other networks seem to treat me so much better than @foxnews. i brought them the biggest ratings in history, & i get zip 
i just realized that if you listen to carly fiorina for more than ten minutes straight, you develop a massive headache. she has zero chance 
@strayamaaaate: donaldtrump shaking things up in us elections. jeb bush is really weak. carly fiorina shud go back to hp 

@wwdblane: @realdonaldtrump nice try jeb, my wife agrees with trump over megyn.

@liexafterxlie: @realdonaldtrump @redstate yep. i was there and people were leaving left and right. @ewerickson blew it big time 

small crowds at @redstate today in atlanta. people were very angry at ewerickson, a major sleaze and buffoon who has saved me time and money 
almost universal support that trump won the debate. only @foxnews is consistantly fighting the trump win, and i got them the ratings 
wow, cnn just said that donald trump won the debate, connected best with audience. also, time, drudge, newsmax, n.y.times and more 
.@redstate i miss you all, and thanks for all of your support. political correctness is killing our country. weakness. 
re megyn kelly quote: you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever (nose). just got on w/thought 
so many politically correct fools in our country. we have to all get back to work and stop wasting time and energy on nonsense 



@john832thetruth: @frankluntz your focus groups are rigged and your company ran out of $ in 2011. keep speaking the truth trump 2016 ♡ 
the hatred that clown @krauthammer has for me is unbelievable – causes him to lie when many others say trump easily won debate. 
....dopey @krauthammer should be fired. @foxnews 
.@foxnews you should be ashamed of yourself. i got you the highest debate ratings in your history & you say nothing but bad... 


@elvisfever: @megynkelly @foxnews out to get you with baited questions. she was angry at you. very hostile and unprofessional

@diplomtc_immnty: @realdonaldtrump they tried to take you out & your poll numbers skyrocketed. voters matter, not @foxnews moderators. 
@reid2962: @realdonaldtrump @foxnews i expected better from @megynkelly, wondering what is her hidden agenda. 
@resi_diederich: @platinumrosie @realdonaldtrump @foxnews @megynkelly is that all you've got??? haha. 
@jetranger69: @realdonaldtrump @foxnews @megynkelly @bretbaier was a disaster also. 
@lking2fly: i gotta have @realdonaldtrump in the white house that'd be such a game changer 

i really enjoyed the debate tonight even though the @foxnews trio, especially @megynkelly, was not very good or professional 
.@frankluntz, your so called focus groups are a total joke. don't come to my office looking for business again. you are a clown 
wow, @megynkelly really bombed tonight. people are going wild on twitter funny to watch. 
.@frankluntz i won every poll of the debate tonight by massive margins @drudge_report & @time so where did you find that dumb panel. 

.@frankluntz is a low class slob who came to my office looking for consulting work and i had zero interest. now he picks anti trump panels 
@timjcam: @megynkelly @frankluntz @realdonaldtrump fox viewers give low marks to bimbo @megynkelly will consider other programs

@insureretire @realdonaldtrump @gawker best response ever give trump lemons and he will sell them back to you for a steep profit. 
do you notice that hillary spews out jeb's name as often as possible in order to give him status? she knows trump is her worst nightmare. 
many of hillary’s donors are the same donors as jeb bush’s—all rich, will have total control—know them well. 
@cookingdoll: @realdonaldtrump yet another illegal arrested for bludgeoning a woman. stop the invasion.

wow, did the @nytimes fall into the bush trap where his people convinced them how happy he was that i was hurting other candidates & not him 


@lynn_weiser: @realdonaldtrump @danscavino @erictrump @ericbolling it's a trailblazing campaign a campaign that connects to people 

bush is pretending that the trump surge is great for him and the @nytimesworld is reporting bush delight con job, a bush nightmare

watch my interview with @ericbolling on @foxnews today at 11:30am et 
@colinswood @realdonaldtrump is worth more than all of the other presidential candidates combined and plenty more. 
@blindtothetruth trump is polling well because he speaks his mind. not like some of the career politicians he's running against. cowards. 
@sjh2222 difference between politicians and @realdonaldtrump = pols are bought & paid for. trump can't be bought, bullied or bribed

just at a news conference from trump turnberry in scotland. everybody was there & will be all over television tonite. back on trail saturday 
carl cameron @foxnews is the only reporter i know who consistently fumbles & misrepresents poll results. he has been so wrong & he hates it 
@bdean1468 the alpha male in the 2016 race: @realdonaldtrump he has real success stories, tons of money, confident, & he's his own backer 
@lasannewton @realdonaldtrump the only candidate who will not owe favors to campaign contributors

i really like the koch brothers (members of my p.b. club), but i don't want their money or anything else from them. cannot influence trump 
thank you.https://twitter.com/tomnocera/status/626293868233928705 … 
people like lawyer elizabeth beck and failed writer harry hurt & others talk about me but know nothing about me—crazy 
how can a dummy dope like harry hurt, who wrote a failed book about me but doesn’t know me or anything about me, be on tv discussing trump? 

... while tom brady is guilty because he replaced his legal cellphone? 
per @rushlimbaugh: why does hillary clinton get the benefit of the doubt (after she destroys her illegal email server) ... 

@jereegeestavich @realdonaldtrump you are blowing everyone else away. not just ahead, but doubling. wow. 

@tomnocera @danscavino @dallasmavs @mcuban trump's work ethic gives me hope he's a tireless and smart worker: a winner not a whiner. 
i truly love all of the millions of people who are sticking with me despite so many media lies. there is a great silent majority looming 
thank you @morning_joe for throwing the pathetic reporter from the failing and money losing daily beast off the air. really cool 
so many people who know nothing about me are commenting all over t.v. and the media as though they have great d.j.t. insight. know nothing 
.@cnn why is somebody (beck) i beat so soundly all of a sudden an expert on donald trump (all over television). she knows nothing about me. 
.cnn & @cnnpolitics lawyer elizabeth beck did a terrible job against me, she lost (i even got legal fees). i loved beating her,she was easy 
lawyer elizabeth beck was easy for me to beat. ask her clients if they are happy with her results against me. got total win and legal fees. 
.@cnn & @cnnpolitics did not say that lawyer beck lost the case and i got legal fees. also, she wanted to breast pump in front of me at dep. 
@jan102345678: @realdonaldtrump mr.trump,i am thrilled you are running for president of usa.you are the only man for the job 



a nation without borders is not a nation at all. we must have a wall. the rule of law matters. jeb just doesn’t get it. 
while i’m beating my opponents in the polls, i’m also beating lobbyists, special interests & donors that are supporting them with billions.

i will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00. will be talking about the poor treatment of our veterans, illegal immigration, etc. 
look how small the pages have become @wsj. looks like a tabloid—saving money i assume 
this story is no longer about john mccain, it’s about our horribly treated vets. illegals are treated better than our wonderful veterans. 
it was only after i informed nbc that i wouldn't do the apprentice that they became upset w/ me. they couldn’t care less about “inclusion 
@amit_ @realdonaldtrump i agree 100%. mccain is fighting for illegal immigrant but never did anything for our vets. 
@linflies @ghostdancer_2 @contrarian11 @michaelcohen212 @chriscuomo @deptvetaffairs ...rest of gop only cries but trump gets stuff done 
@valenti317 @realdonaldtrump the left is petrified of you why else would they be attacking you so vigorously? 
@mjjustus1 @andrewstilesusa @realdonaldtrump trump already hosts vets at his resorts. what does hillary do? 
@rtmatador trump says things that no one else would even consider saying, i agree with him on the immigration situation, i love honesty 
@_eod i believe we have passed that point. there are homeless veterans in usa & yet illegal aliens get government housing 

@vetapologist this is big criticism of the republican field. speak truth and stop being so pc. this is why @realdonaldtrump resonates 

we will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans. 
the ever dwindling @wsj which is worth about 1/10 of what it was purchased for, is always hitting me politically. who cares 
@rw84jr: @realdonaldtrump glad u r man enough 2 speak the truth in this pathetic politically correct world 
@jenism101: @realdonaldtrump @97musick trump is the only person we believe will actually set things right.

@maxchupailo: @kuuleme69 @cspan @realdonaldtrump gotta love the honesty 

@ebalky: @realdonaldtrump that's all the career politicians do is talk 
@ginaandersonrn: @realdonaldtrump ...rn for 27 yrs. veterans have less benefits than medicaid recipients. thnx for speaking#truth

@2014_vince: the left wing politically correct cannot handle big don giving the truth....reality....keep saying it like it is 
@pg_rant: they can't handle you donald so want you out the race, well good luck,because we know you won't walk away give it to them 
@hl3tweets: mccain epitomizes the career politicians who have gotten us into our $19 trillion train wreck, including the va debacle. 

i will be making some very big campaign stops next week big crowds and tremendous energy make america great again 
the republican party must get tougher and smarter, and fast, or it will go down to a very big defeat just like the last two times 
a true piece about the standing ovations i got yesterdayhttp://thegazette.com/subject/news/government/politics/cruz jindal trump score big at family leader gop presidential candidate event 20150719 … 
the veterans administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly. john mccain has done nothing to help them but talk. 
john mccain called thousands of people crazies when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in phoenix. he owes apology 
@mwood_79: @sharylattkisson why do they attack mr trump? because he has something they dont. the ability of truth trump is here 
@dunn_cheri: @sharylattkisson mr trump the only one telling the truth. liberals can't stand the fact that your are leading in the poll 
@amsardina: @realdonaldtrump @sharylattkisson kick there ass trump 



one of the reasons i am no fan of john mccain is that our vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians. i will fix va quickly. 

why would anybody listen to @mittromney? he lost an election that should have easily been won against obama. by the way,so did john mccain 
congrats to the new gov. of texas, @gregabbott_tx, for taking a tough & bold stance at the border. should have been done long ago by perry. 
i have a proven track record supporting our veterans. veterans deserve universal access to care. va scandal proves politicians are inept. 
....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care. 
it's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our veterans..... 
i will make this right for our great vets

@bdean1468 @jlangdale @realdonaldtrump @hillaryclinton @cnn say it loud & say it proud we want trump 
when will people, and the media, start to apologize to me for my statement, mexico is sending.... , which turned out to be true? el chapo 
....likewise, billions of dollars gets brought into mexico through the border. we get the killers, drugs & crime, they get the money 
el chapo and the mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a vacuum cleaner, sucking drugs and death right into the u.s. 
the u.s. will invite el chapo, the mexican drug lord who just escaped prison, to become a u.s. citizen because our leaders can't say no 

.....but that's what i've been saying. very unfair treatment by the media 
now that the mexican drug lord escaped from prison, everyone is saying that most of the cocaine etc. coming into the u.s. comes over border 
i hear that sleepy eyes @chucktodd will be fired like a dog from ratings starved meet the press? i can't imagine what is taking so long 
...trump, however, would kick his ass 
can you envision jeb bush or hillary clinton negotiating with 'el chapo', the mexican drug lord who escaped from prison? .... 
sleep eyes @chucktodd is killing meet the press. isn't he pathetic? love watching him fail 
mexico's biggest drug lord escapes from jail. unbelievable corruption and usa is paying the price. i told you so

i'll be in iowa tonight making a speech to a record setting crowd. the word is getting out, make america great again 
the leader and negotiators representing mexico are far smarter and more cunning than the leader and negotiators representing the u.s. 
only very stupid people think that the united states is making good trade deals with mexico.mexico is killing us at the border and at trade

if i win the presidency, my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike bush's appointee john roberts on obamacare. 
.@univision cares far more about mexico than it does about the u.s. are they controlled by the mexican government? 
anyone who wants strong borders and good trade deals for the us should boycott @univision. 
once again the bush appointed supreme court justice john roberts has let us down. jeb pushed him hard remember 
i love mexico but not the unfair trade deals that the us so stupidly makes with them. really bad for us jobs, only good for mexico. 
univision wants to back out of signed @missuniverse contract because i exposed the terrible trade deals that the u.s. makes with mexico. 
mexican gov doesn't want me talking about terrible border situation & horrible trade deals. forcing univision to get me to stop no way 
@jwcesare i appreciate @realdonaldtrump and his straight talk. our country needs this.

out of hundreds of deals & transactions, i have used the bankruptcy laws a few times to make deals better. nothing personal, just business. 
almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool. icahn, black, zell—but nobody says they went bankrupt 
people buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals. it’s a very effective & commonly used business tool. 
stop saying i went bankrupt. i never went bankrupt but like many great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage—smart 

has charles @krauthammer ever apologized for being so totally wrong on iraq? i called it right in every way—make america great again

my major hotel conversion of the old post office on pennsylvania avenue in d.c. is under budget and ahead of schedule. should be u.s.a. 
we are rebuilding other countries while our own country is going to hell. time to rebuild the u.s.a. tell our stupid politicians, enough

train wreck just the beginning. our roads, airports, tunnels, bridges, electric grid all falling apart.i can fix for 20% of pols, & better 
remember, politicians are all talk and no action. our country is a laughing stock that is going to hell. the lobbyists & donors control all 
the only one to fix the infrastructure of our country is me roads, airports, bridges. i know how to build, pols only know how to talk

why is no one talking about the horrible murder of ana charle by ex con thug west spruill. gunned down on street, naked. why no riots here? 
billions of dollars spent on baltimore and it's still a total mess. leadership is needed, not dollars. our whole country is going to hell

@ghostlyprep: @realdonaldtrump is amazing you can tell me he's not when you're as successful as him 

i have been a guest on the view many times when it was successful show. now the show is dying for lack of ratings. too bad 
they now say using the word thug is, like so many other words, not politically correct (even though obama uses it). it is racist. bull 


@staceylambright: i had the pleasure of meeting @realdonaldtrump and hearing him speak a few times. we need to see him on the 2016 ballot

@jtruelove713: if @realdonaldtrump runs for president i will vote for the first time ever. until then........... 
i wonder what the rest of the world is thinking about the united states as they watch the disgusting and out of control baltimore riots? 
hopefully there won't be any problems in baltimore tonight. be calm, be cool do not let anybody get hurt.there is just too much to live for 
the best social program, by far, is a job our jobs are being taken away from us by china and many other countries incompetent leader. 
president obama, you have a big job to do. go to baltimore and bring both sides together. with proper leadership, it can be done do it. 
our country has to come together. we have to start working with, and really liking, each other. the whole world is watching baltimore. 

the mayor of baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters space to destroy another real genius 
now that the ineffective baltimore police have allowed the city to be destroyed, are the u.s. taxpayers expected to rebuild it (again)? 
our great african american president hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying baltimore 
blatant and rampant property destruction in baltimore as the police stand by and watch. should be a lesson on how not to handle riots. sad 
wow, 15 policemen hurt in baltimore, some badly where is the national guard. police must get tough, and fast thugs must be stopped.

china has a backdoor into the trans pacific partnership. this deal does not address currency manipulation. china is laughing at us. 
the trans pacific partnership will lead to even greater unemployment. do not pass it. 
republicans should not be giving obama fast track authority on trade. the trans pacific partnership will squeeze our manufacturing sector 
the trans pacific partnership is an attack on america's business. it does not stop japan's currency manipulation. this is a bad deal.

looking forward to keynoting @chesterfieldgop lincoln reagan gala this friday at the country club at the highlands. sold out record crowd 


.@jonahnro you should be totally focused on trying to save the badly failing national review instead of focusing on me. work hard @nro 
@hillarysusans: getting ready for next week with @realdonaldtrump on monday. @nhgop @foxnews 


.@nro @jonahnro wow, just looked at the stats for national review. dying fast, doing very little business. save this conservative voice 
@andrewwilkie85: @realdonaldtrump @smxtty_ i think that you would be as good as reagan. please run 


@stevesgoddard: @smxtty_ it would be very frightening to have president who has actually accomplished something during their life, 
@mr_president706: @realdonaldtrump please run for president, and show these so called republicans how to get the job done. 
@sam_tucker17: you would be the best president. you're political critiques are always on the money. you are way better than hillary 
@olivianuzzi: @realdonaldtrump you are amazing 
@johnmarkowitz: @realdonaldtrump you are damn good 
@faktmeister: u r 1000% correct, politicians can't fix problems politicians made. the executive branch needs a real chief executive. run 
@themightylayman: dear @realdonaldtrump: you are the most admired man in the world and everybody hopes you run for president. 
@scapesrus: @realdonaldtrump @smxtty_ u would make a damn good one 
@smxtty_: donald trump would be the greatest president thank you. 
the reason ed schultz said nice things about me is that i’m the only repub who won't cut social security, etc. i’ll make america rich again 
i’m a conservative, but the weakness of conservatives is that they destroy each other, whereas liberals unite to win. 
with a stupid guy like jonah goldberg who uses “tweeting like a 14 year old girl” to hit me, no wonder the nro is doing so poorly. @jonahnro 
people have been forced to resign positions for far less than @jonahnro’s “tweeting like a 14 year old girl” 
.@jonahnro you stated that i started “relentlessly tweeting like a 14 year old girl...” horrible insult to women. resign now or later 
“when you can't make them see the light, make them feel the heat.” – ronald reagan 

republicans have once again capitulated to obama. this time on the iran nuclear treaty. when will it end? 

@ronniewnichol just viewed the video of the changes to @turnberrybuzz. an already stunning course will now be even more spectacular 


wow, hillary and bill are in deep trouble, but don’t worry, my fellow republicans will let them off the hook. all talk, no action. 

i guess @edshow is a lot smarter than dopes like @jonahnro & @stephenfhayes. oh well, both mags are dying anyway.http://www.mediaite.com/tv/hell mustve frozen over because ed schultz is defending donald trump/ … 

.@danaperino wrote a wonderful book, “and the good news is.. dana has a fabulous perspective on life & politics—go get it

@itoldyoumonsoon: @realdonaldtrump @jonahnro @nro @bretbaier why does @greta put you on hers? because i get great ratings and other reasons 
@dalasner: ed schultz just extolled your business savvy, maybe there is hope for msnbc be careful if sharpton endorses you, boss 
.@stephenfhayes: i heard you were a joke on the media panel this weekend in new hampshire. you just don't have what it takes @joenbc 
@1smltwngrl: @realdonaldtrump make some heads roll. run for president dammit 
@slider6294:@nro @jonahnro to be fair, impossible to fill those shoes. but consistent conservative principles would be a start i agree 
@ronbrown1970: @realdonaldtrump @eastonwestwood @jonahnro @stephenfhayes i model my management by mr trump. consistent is everything 

@rennie022164: @eastonwestwood @jonahnro @stephenfhayes i'm thinking a businessman like trump is the only one who can fix this mess true 
@brooke_burton_: @realdonaldtrump why don't you just run for president? you would have my vote 
@slider6294: @realdonaldtrump @nro @jonahnro it has cratered since wfb passed away. so true, wfb is spinning in his grave jonah killed it 
@eastonwestwood: it's pathetic for @jonahnro & @stephenfhayes to bash @realdonaldtrump as non serious talkers bashing a successful doer 
national review @nro may be going out of business because of the really pathetic job being done by @jonahnro. no talent means death sad 
.@megynkelly sorry, there was only one breakout star this weekend in new hampshire. just check out the local new hampshire media

.@weeklystandard i know your business is failing but you should try to get writers far better than @stephenfhayes. 

how does failed writer and pundit like @stephenfhayes, with no success and little talent, get away with criticizing candidates. 
so much dishonest reporting (or non reporting) in political media—an amazing experience for me. @bretbaier

@samdoyle12 @realdonaldtrump great posts. as a budding entrepreneur, i appreciate the quotes great work hard and good luck 

entrepreneurs: be tough, be smart, be personable, but don’t take things personally. that’s good business. 
entrepreneurs: don’t ever think you’ve done it all already or that you’ve done your best. you haven't so don't limit yourself 
entrepreneurs: follow your instincts and keep your focus intact. you alone know where you really want to go. 
entrepreneurs: paying attention can be a cost effective way of protecting yourself. 
entrepreneurs: look at the solution, not the problem. learn to focus on what will give results. 
entrepreneurs: keep your momentum. without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere. 
entrepreneurs: keep the big picture in mind. there are always opportunities & possibilities, and thinking too small can negate a lot of them

@adamodell: @realdonaldtrump just wanted to say i am loving the us celebrity apprentice on bbc1 in the uk , great show and celebrities 


@sethanatorr:trump should run for president. we need him. obama has accomplished nothing. we all know mr. trump knows how to get stuff done 
@basilicaceo: thank you, @realdonaldtrump, for your @apprenticenbc tribute to @joan_rivers. love you both. miss her very much. 
@shotgunfloyd: @realdonaldtrump classic 
@johnyc46: you must sacrifice 4 years and get this country headed back on track. really think you're the answer as many agree. 
the mexican legal system is corrupt, as is much of mexico. pay me the money that is owed me now and stop sending criminals over our border 


the evening news broadcasts must stop talking about weather—boring and too many other topics. 
i could fix tv talk shows that are doing poorly—there is tremendous talent out there waiting to be tapped—and nobody sees it 
put the glamour, beauty & mystery back in the oscars and the ratings will zoom. also, & most importantly, the oscars need credibility. 
i told everybody the oscars were no good—nielsen ratings confirmed, one of the lowest ratings in history. 
the @huffingtonpost is a total joke & laughing stock of journalism, as is gross arianna huffington. they don’t report the facts 
i have a lawsuit in mexico’s corrupt court system that i won but so far can’t collect. don’t do business with mexico 
the oscars were a great night for mexico & why not—they are ripping off the us more than almost any other nation. 
the talks between the u.s. and iran are going on forever, world's longest negotiation. obama has no idea what he is doing incompetent 

@jpnwrites the oscars can learn a lot from the miss universe pageant. @realdonaldtrump true 
@jcl30 @realdonaldtrump had a run round @turnberrybuzz ails this morning. going to be great when all the changes are finished. thanks.

the oscars are a sad joke, very much like our president. so many things are wrong 
what ever happened to the good old days of the academy awards. this show is an insult to the past, just plain bad 
worst graphics and stage backdrop ever at the oscars. show is terrible, really boring

whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right. henry ford 
now that mitt is gone, all we have to do is get bush to drop out and trump to run—and we will win 
when i broadly proclaimed mitt “choked” – and would do it again—everybody said yeah, he’s right. 
i will take full credit for mitt romney dropping out of the race—looks like he won’t be endorsing trump any time soon. 

mitt did the right thing—not because he had to but because he never would have been given a second chance after his first fiasco 
everyone is saying the bad news is that donald trump is going to take credit & they are right—mitt wouldn’t have won anyway.

@fantasticharris: @realdonaldtrump loves the @patriots 

getting ready to go on @kellyandmichael two great people 
i guess rupert murdoch and the @nypost don't like donald trump. such false reporting about my big hit in iowa. even my enemies said bull. 
wow, i have always liked the @nypost but they have really lied when they covered me in iowa. packed house, standing o, best speech sad. 
going over to @abc to do live at 9:00. 

@willowfrantn: @realdonaldtrump i dvrd kelly and michael today to see you, but you weren't on missed you wednesday

.@lord_sugar how did you enjoy mar a lago? it was nice having you there my people thought you were terrific 

so many people have told me that i should host meet the press and replace the moron who is on now. just too busy, especially next 10 years 
@coverallpads: @realdonaldtrump @apprenticenbc awesome show. i haven't missed 1 show from season 1 till now great 
@genelingerfelt: country's been run by low i.q. people for years. why @sentedcruz, @realdonaldtrump, amaze us when they speak. 
apprentice = big hit. miss universe = big hit. i always get big ratings. if i hosted meet the press instead of sleepy eyes,a smash @nbcnews 
i am convinced that sleepy eyes chuck todd was only a placeholder for someone else at meet the press. he bombed, franchise in ruins @nbc 

president obama, our great leader, wants to declare martial law in new york city as a means of helping out with the massive storm. 
wow, the final ratings for the miss universe pageant show that it won in all key demos number one on sunday. i have a winner 
as usual, the storm of the century was not nearly as bad as forecast. what a waste of time, energy and money

isn’t it interesting that the tragedy in paris took place in one of the toughest gun control countries in the world? 
if the people so violently shot down in paris had guns, at least they would have had a fighting chance. 
congratulations to new congressman @leezeldin being named to house foreign affairs comm. and co chair the house republican israel caucus. 
why does obama continue to release the worst of the worst from gitmo? look at paris and wake up

.@juddapatow i agree 
i look forward to going to the land investment expo in iowa on jan. 23. record crowd—sold out venue. @landexpo @peoplescompany 

.@kevinjonas was great but he brought the wrong person into the boardroom. had he brought lorenzo in, he would not have been fired. 
wow, despite the switch to monday night, @apprenticenbc ratings were higher than even the sunday night show. 
@nicnae: @elginet @realgilbert @apprenticenbc @realdonaldtrump you're awesome funny and u gained a new fan probably many 

@yankeerunnerlv:can u trick obama into appearing on @apprenticenbc by telling him golf is involved so you can do country a favor& fire him

@cpetelis: @realdonaldtrump if you run for president i, a democrat will vote for you. watched merideth show on 12/22 
to everyone, including all haters and losers, happy new year. work hard, be smart and always remember, winning takes care of everything 

in the end, you're measured not by how much you undertake but by what you finally accomplish. 
without passion you don't have energy, without energy you have nothing. find work that you love and the energy will be there. 
if you're interested in 'balancing' work and pleasure, stop trying to balance them. instead make your work more pleasurable. 
@peter_upfield: @realdonaldtrump @frank_puggi run donald, run 
@sellingva: @realdonaldtrump: sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.

what separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate. 
sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.

@used2bmac: @realdonaldtrump @foxandfriends listening now such wise words thank you 
@blarescape3: @foxandfriends maybe u can help get us some better trade deals for imports & exports. just a thought that would be easy 
@derekvarsalona: @realdonaldtrump @foxandfriends listening to you now. you are great. 

@alvinkaisi: @realdonaldtrump @bigbobbywatson amy is a sap sharpton loves suckers like her true, she is a fool 
@davidebergstein @allenwest a much needed trump/west ticket. opposite of our 'president', 2 straight talkers who understand the enemy/world 

@interbrief: @realdonaldtrump excellent appearance said it like it is as usual 
@sailing_j: @realdonaldtrump you just made me laugh. the sony women is stupid for calling al charlatan 
@musicbyjules: trump: (on sony's amy pascal) she should be fired for being stupid. that's hilarious~thanks for the laugh @foxandfriends 

i will be on @foxandfriends at 7:00 in 10 minutes. have a great day all 

no wonder sony is doing so badly. really stupid leadership that wants al sharpton to help. watch him turn the tables on chief amy pascal. 
can you believe that sony chief amy pascal wants to meet with al sharpton to seek forgiveness for her racial slurs. al is laughing at her 
@pianobecca: @realdonaldtrump in love with trump tower too clearly tower built by man who is strong & abel to serve as our presedent 
@fackinpeter: @realdonaldtrump i think you should be barbara walters' most fascinating person of 2014 i agree but have already been twice 




@jetsbb: @realdonaldtrump that win will have massive ramifications for the next decade. a very bleak day for the @nyjets i agree 
the jets should have let them score to get the number one draft pick, who will be really good. it will just never change for them 
@888maggie888: @apprenticenbc i want to see @realdonaldtrump he has the best hair in the biz you know his wife is amazing too

@kingof_class: @realdonaldtrump hey donald...in love with trump tower on 5th avenue during the holidays 
@gdestefano95: anyone else like to see trump in office? he's an american patriot with real experience and a huge stake in the economy 


@hersheykissling: i'd have to say that @realdonaldtrump has one of the best accounts on twitter 
@onecherfan: @realdonaldtrump @bb1fantambra never thought i'd say this but mr trump ur right 
@ignaciusg: @realdonaldtrump @greta you are awesome, sir thank you for gifting our marine 
@jackwitty: i don't want a party as my president, i want a decisive,confident leader. @realdonaldtrump will fire china. give us a spark 

@tray24u1: @realdonaldtrump: if america was under the threat of imminent attack, would obama use torture or a kiss? 

@pianobecca: @realdonaldtrump when will you anounce your running for presedent? thousands milllions have baited breath we need you 

@yochambers: @realdonaldtrump @toptv005 @vikkitb we've had 16 years of bad presidents..war terrorism, bad economy etc... 
@toptv005: @vikkitb he was thé very first one to warn people about barack hussein obama & people blamed him? well, he was right 
“some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in the world.the marines don't have that problem.” ronald reagan 
@vikkitb: @realdonaldtrump is so right with everything he is saying run... please run for president 
isn't it interesting that immediately after september 11th, everybody was asking for, and indeed demanding, torture of any kind. no reports 

when terrorists are beheading and executing american citizens in such a brutal way,the report on torture should be the least of our concerns 
@constancemcn: @realdonaldtrump: donald, i am in love and admire you run for president in 2016 and all will be well 
the terrorists cut off the heads of americans and laugh, then want to sell us the bodies for $1,000,000. we fight over sleep deprivation 
@jvas1110: @realdonaldtrump trump for president 

@pianobecca: i am going to vote for @realdonaldtrump in 2016 because we need a leader with vision 
@peterday20: @realdonaldtrump love how you speak your mind well, somebody has to 

these islamists chop americans’ heads off and want to destroy us. we should be applauding the cia, not persecuting them. 
if america was under the threat of imminent attack, would obama use torture or a kiss? 

@redvetttes: @realdonaldtrump @itsryanhilton if he tells china where to go ,he has my vote 
@the_lady_colors: @realdonaldtrump @itsryanhilton he would be the very best of what this country needs today

policy towards our enemies: hit them hard, hit them fast, hit them often & then tell them it was because they are the enemy 
obama & democrat leaders did a great disservice by releasing the papers on torture. the world is laughing at us—they think we are fools

conde nast made a big mistake going into the world trade center. the place is a total disaster, and i feel this is only the beginning 
people are really unhappy with the endless security checks at the new world trade center. durst is a terrible manager. tenants furious 
durst is a disaster at operating the new world trade center. it takes forever for workers or visitors to get in with impossible security.

obamacare continues to increase insurance premiums & raise record deductibles. new congress must use every tool to defund.

in the very least, congress must defund obama’s unconstitutional amnesty order. 
it’s tuesday. how many more ‘the view’ execs will leak that they want @rosie gone? show is failing. 
yesterday our national debt topped a record $18t. over 44% has accrued under obama. a real mess.

@bjkizer74: @realdonaldtrump please run in 2016 america needs a potus with balls to stop america from being a worldwide laughingstock. 




if obamacare should not be repealed then why has obama & congress exempted their staffs? 
obama is community organizing from the oval office on ferguson today. more riots sure to follow. 

congress’ greatest card against obama is the power of the purse. use it 
now obama is keeping our soldiers in afghanistan for at least another year. he is losing two wars simultaneously.

president obama has absolutely no control (or respect) over the african american community they have fared so poorly under his presidency. 

who is the moron who decided to release the ferguson grand jury findings after 9:00 o'clock in the evening. what were they thinking? 
our country is totally fractured and, with our weak leadership in washington, you can expect ferguson type riots and looting in other places 
sadly, because president obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations 
as china and the rest of the world continue to rip off the u.s. economically, they laugh at us and our president over the riots in ferguson 
can you imagine what putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the u.s. as they watch the ferguson riot 
if the decision by the grand jury in ferguson was the exact opposite, you would still be having the riots right now 
despite having a black president, the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades.if obama were a leader, this would not be the case 
@therealzach49: this is why we need @realdonaldtrump in office. @barackobama doesn't know how to keep order 
@abdul_akbarzai1: @therealzach49: @realdonaldtrump can't wait for you to take over this country and rebuild what obama destroyed 
@d_mellette: @realdonaldtrump for president 2k16 
why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in ferguson at 9:00 in the evening a prime time for riots not smart. 
iran and the united states just pushed deadline back seven months on working out a nuclear deal. iran is tapping along our bad negotiators 
isis is starting its own currency. may be stronger than the dollar if obamacare is fully implemented. 
there is no excuse for riots in ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome. 
fact – amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness. obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform. 
premiering on january 4th, the 14th season of @apprenticenbc will have major fireworks every episode. the board room is electric

congratulations to bill o’brien on being named the republican speaker of the nh house. well earned & well deserved. a great guy. 
“be tough, be smart, be personable, but don’t take things personally. that’s good business.” – think like a champion 

“intellectuals solve problems, geniuses prevent them.” – albert einstein 

entrepreneurs: keep your momentum. without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere. 
entrepreneurs: problems are a mind exercise. enjoy the challenge. 
if you really want to succeed, you'll have to go for it every day. the big time isn't for slackers. keep up your stamina and remain curious. 
they're going to riot in ferguson no matter what. 
you don't necessarily need the best location. what you need is the best deal. the art of the deal 


if we do not protect the rule of law then we can expect even more illegals to cross the border. obama’s executive amnesty is dangerous. 
iraq should be paying us while we fight isis. give the money to the families of our brave soldiers. 


i enjoyed meeting with @mattblunt @trumptowerny to discuss why our government must address currency manipulation. many us jobs are at stake. 
“success in golf depends less on strength of body than upon strength of mind and character.” arnold palmer 

repubs must not allow pres obama to subvert the constitution of the us for his own benefit & because he is unable to negotiate w/ congress. 
i am no fan of bill cosby but never the less some free advice if you are innocent, do not remain silent. you look guilty as hell 


if you don’t publicize your successes, your competitors will be sure to belittle them. get the word out 
watch – wh official says that obamacare/romneycare architect gruber was ‘an important figure’ in crafting the lawhttp://hotair.com/archives/2014/11/18/dems admit gruber important figure/ … 
“if you like your plan you keep it.” = “gruber is just some adviser.” two of obama’s greatest lies told to the american public. 

“get in. get it done. get it done right. get out.” – fred c. trump (my father ) 

for those that constantly say that “global warming” is now “climate change”—they changed the name. the name global warming wasn’t working 

@blakehoagland what is the best advice you could give to a young entrepreneur, mr. trump? you have to be passionate about your work 
@rafaelmerrydel1: @realdonaldtrump can obama salvage his presidency by going to ferguson and bringing peace? no 


@ettuandyou: @realdonaldtrump i've got to tell you, i love love love the trump in toronto. 

@sgrifkin: donaldtrump when will you next appear on television? i am very interested in your opinion of the current nyc real estate market 
@daniel10ynwa: @realdonaldtrump you're the man mr. trump 
@joblink31: @realdonaldtrump trump is so important, that every time he's makes a decision, it's good for the economy . 
there are many jonathan gruber types selling the global warming stuff and they really do believe the american public is stupid. 
entrepreneurs: always remember that deals are fluid. terms are always negotiable and time can be the best option for success. 

“the true competitors are the ones who always play to win.” – tom brady @patriots 
obamacare will continue to stop entrepreneurship, slow growth and halt research & development. defund, repeal & replace 
“remember that some things are worth waiting for. plans can change, sometimes for good reason.” – trump never give up 

at least obamacare/romneycare architect gruber admitted, albeit privately, that we were lied to by obama. gang of liars. 
via @breitbartnews by @mboyle1: “obama’s amnesty will give illegal aliens public benefits”http://www.breitbart.com/big government/2014/11/17/exclusive report obama s executive amnesty will put illegal aliens on welfare public benefits like obamacare and more …

congratulations to @sixteenchicago @trumpchicago for being honored with a @michelinguidechi two star rating again this year 

just like jonathan gruber viciously lied & called americans “stupid” on obamacare, many consultants are doing the same on global warming. 


obama’s china ‘climate’ deal binds america with language of ‘will’ curb emissions now while china only ‘intends’ to curb in 2030. bad deal 

obamacare/romneycare architect gruber was paid over $6m with our tax dollars yet obama only claims he ‘was some adviser.’ 
deportations are now at a record low. obama manipulated the numbers to lie to the public that they were at a record high. secure the border

entrepreneurs: set the bar high. do the best you possibly can. apply your skills and talent, but above all, be tenacious. 
entrepreneurs: set the example. you can motivate others as well as yourself by remembering you are setting the example. 
entrepreneurs: see yourself as victorious. look at the solution, not the problem. keep your focus positive. 
obama’s attack on the internet is another top down power grab. net neutrality is the fairness doctrine. will target conservative media.

@thepizzapopo: it feels like i've been waiting for the @apprenticenbc forever i'm so happy and ready for this season @realdonaldtrump 
@chucknorton1: i am reading the art of the deal by @realdonaldtrump . i should have read it a long time ago. a must read of must reads. 

do not go back into iraq unless they agree, in a signed formal instrument, to give the u.s. 50% of their oil reserves.make the deal dummies 
we spent two trillion dollars in iraq and got nothing. now we are going back and will again get nothing because our leaders are clueless 
we are now sending thousands of additional troops to iraq to teach them how to fight they will run, billions wasted what does u.s. get?

obama’s amnesty executive order can now be stopped by majority leader mcconnell with riders. that’s one reason we needed the senate. 
the maryland democrat party attacked me with a racist flyer. @hogan4governor won, 2nd gop governor elected in 40 years. 

yesterday was a referendum on obamacare & all other obama fiascos. republicans can now rein him in. 
obama has now had two record & historic midterm losses. there is hope & change for america. 

congratulations to @charliecrist who has now lost a statewide election in florida as a republican, independent & democrat. 


had @senscottbrown asked me to do a robo call for him, i would have done it and he would have won.

@mangooppl: @realdonaldtrump which means president trump 

a really bad night for president obama. now the republicans have to get together and get the job done 
.@flgovscott: amazing race, tremendous courage you deserved this win for a very old fashioned reason you have been a great governor 
one year ago i started calling president obama incompetent and people thought it was too tough. tonight everyone is using that word

obama will quarantine all soldiers returning from africa for 21 days. but he still allows all who contract ebola into country? hypocrite.

president obama strongly considering a plan to bring non u.s. citizens with ebola to the united states for treatment. now i know he's nuts 
watch me on @seanhannity's show at 10pm tonight on @foxnews 
success requires 100% of your focus and 100% of your effort. don't sell yourself short. 
keep your momentum. without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere. 
mark udall was the deciding vote for obamacare & now 250,000 coloradans were dropped from their plans. vote @corygardner 
john foust is a liberal who supports obamacare and opposes ebola travel ban. send conservative @barbaracomstock to congress 
“i believe anybody who is not afraid to fail is a winner.” @joetorre 
all the governors are already backing off of the ebola quarantines. bad decision that will lead to more mayhem. 
wh refused a meeting with the israeli defense minister. if only obama hated iran as much as he dislikes israel. 


obamacare has brought skyrocketing premium increases & unaffordable deductibles which will lead to less care & job losses.

fox & friends, going on now enjoy 
will be on @foxandfriends at 7.00. (30 minutes). a great deal to talk about including ebola quarantine. 
@realnickventi: i'd vote for @realdonaldtrump way before i'd vote for hillary. great 
@thebingle: @realdonaldtrump @riannarichards donald trump said that before the virus' made it to u.s. that's what i do 
@melanyalvilla: @realdonaldtrump you are my role model such an amazing man. thank you. 

@tylerrice199: @mike_riccardi @realdonaldtrump easily, he is one of the most intelligent among america. he would win over hilary thanks 
@zackkeighron: @realdonaldtrump should run for president 

there are just so many penalties and such long commercials in these nfl games that they are no longer worth watching. soft hitting & boring 
i would absolutely consider investing in atlantic city again, great and hard working people, but much would have to change taxes, regs., etc 
yes, i won the right to have my name taken off trump plaza in a.c. because it was not operated up to a very high standard and no involvement 
i made a fortune in atlantic city, got out years ago (great timing), and havn't been back in many years. i have nothing to do with a.c. 
with all that is happening with ebola, including the doctor who so easily came back to new york, obama still refuses to stop the flights 
@mickeybeaupre: @realdonaldtrump i wish you would run for president mr trump we need you god bless you. 

@catpenis: @realdonaldtrump i respect your integrity sir. rock on. 
@hommergsimpson: @realdonaldtrump please please think about running in 2016 
“yesterday's home runs don't win today's games.” – babe ruth 
there is zero margin for error on ebola. are we confident in obama when he can’t even make a website for $5 billion? 


michelle nunn supports amnesty, a weak border & obamacare. she is an obama liberal. send dc an independent voice. vote @perduesenate 
via @breitbartnews by @j_strong: “obama administration quietly prepares ‘surge of millions’ of new immigrant ids”http://www.breitbart.com/big government/2014/10/19/exclusive obama admin quietly prepares surge of millions of immigrant ids … 
canadian pm harper immediately called the ottawa attack terrorism. at least north america has a strong leader who lives in reality. 

the ebola doctor who just flew to n.y. from west africa and went on the subway, bowling and dining is a very selfish man should have known 

@nickjohns0n: @realdonaldtrump is my idol 
@misskweenbree: @realdonaldtrump run for president 
@bbcoachkk: @realdonaldtrump oh donald i love you 
@itbegins2012: @realdonaldtrump trump, you are great you speak your mind and should continue to do so 
president obama, you are a complete and total disaster, but you have a chance to do something great and important: stop the flights 
president obama has a major meeting on the n.y.c. ebola outbreak, with people flying in from all over the country, but decided to play golf 
i never thought i'd say it in my lifetime, but president barack hussein obama, aka barry sotoro, is a far worse president than jimmy carter 
i have been saying for weeks for president obama to stop the flights from west africa. so simple, but he refused. a total incompetent 
ebola has been confirmed in n.y.c., with officials frantically trying to find all of the people and things he had contact with.obama's fault 
if this doctor, who so recklessly flew into new york from west africa,has ebola,then obama should apologize to the american people & resign 
there is a good possibility that a person who treated patients in west africa and who flew into new york has ebola. touched many, bedlam 
double digit premium increases because of obamacare. dems trying to delay showing numbers until after election, but news is spreading fast

tremendous pressure on president obama to institute a travel ban on ebola stricken west africa. at some point this stubborn dope will fold

later today i’m being honored at the park hyatt in washington, d.c. by the wharton club. the joseph wharton award dinner. a great honor. 


i'm going to d.c. today to check on the hotel i'm building on penn. ave., and then being honored by the wharton school of finance, the best 
why are we letting the three girls, who left the u.s. to join isis, back into the country? how stupid has our once respected country become 
if there is one more ebola case in the u.s., a full travel ban will be instituted. this common sense move should have been done long ago 
@rrogers19: please save this country. @realdonaldtrump 
@beyertristen: @realdonaldtrump a man of business and success, please run for president and fix this country 
@alyssatomazin44: @realdonaldtrump seriously needs to run for president 

the united states troops which were sent to west africa have only gotten 4 hours of ebola training very unfair to them and their families 
the united states, under president obama, has truly become the gang that couldn't shoot straight. everything he touches turns to garbage 
the u.s. accidentally air dropped a large shipment of military weapons and supplies right into the middle of isis as enemy laughs very sad 
negotiation is an art. treat it like one. 
don’t believe kay hagan on ebola travel ban. she also promised that you would keep your healthcare plan under obamacare. vote @thomtillis 

i will be in washington, d.c. tomorrow to receive the 2014 joseph wharton award at the wharton club of d.c.—a great honor @wharton 
@northcutt2013: @realdonaldtrump @mrkenbutler no, he can't and will not run. great man yes, not worth the mud slinging don't be so sure 

@mrkenbutler: donald, you are without a doubt the only person who can correct the collision course obama has us on. please run in 2016 
oscar pistorious will likely only serve 10 months for the cold blooded murder of his girlfriend. another o.j. travesty.the judge is a moron 
wow, one of the all time greats in fashion, oscar de la renta, has just died at 82. great fashion achievements but also a really nice guy 
oscar pistorius only gets five years in prison for killing his girlfriend. ridiculous decision judge couldn't even read her own writings.

@gregazar: @realdonaldtrump donald trump calls out obama thank you for calling out this idiot 
@soyerjanis: donaldtrump @jennifer75ar no more talk, want to hear that you will run for president. will scare the piss out of all countries 

@stephaniewei: @realdonaldtrump playing trump ferry point this morning looking forward to it. have a great time 
president obama has made one mistake after another for a very long time, and the people of the united states are just plain tired of it 

@yankeerunner: i love mon mornings when t is on @foxandfriends as the voice of reason to tell it like it is&dispel another wk of obama lies 
@awakkentv: @realdonaldtrump donald trump for president please save us man 
i will be on @foxandfriends at 7.00 45 minutes. talking about ebola, obama and other strange u.s. happenings 
i just returned from iowa what a beautiful state. the people are amazing and the event for congressman steve king was a great success 
do you believe obama just said that america would be less safe with a travel ban from west africa.this is the thinking of a total mad man 
the lobbyist and political hack that president obama just appointed as the ebola czar, just missed his first major meeting on ebola a joke 

@johnnydollar01: and people zinged donald trump for talking about ebola. how is this klain guy any more qualified? actually, less qualified 






@eeektoys: @realdonaldtrump @katyperry donald is onto something here. russ does look like a really bad lost dummy joke with a fried mind 
@beliywulf: @realdonaldtrump @ronmeier123 save america, trump

@scottmedlin79: @realdonaldtrump run for president. we need someone who isn't scared to make the right calls. 

i'm leaving for iowa now will be great 
if i were president sgt. andrew tahmooressi would be let out of jail with one phone call. if not,mexico would pay a price like never before 
do you think the 14 african nations that are banning west africans from coming into their nations are being called racists? perhaps not 
14 african nations have totally banned west africans from entering their nations. likewise many other nations. but the u.s. = come on in 

obama just appointed an ebola czar with zero experience in the medical area and zero experience in infectious disease control. a total joke 
if you can’t see it, you can’t make it happen. entrepreneurs, chase your dreams with resolute focus & determination. be positive 



now michelle nunn will not admit she voted for obama. of course she did. nunn supports obamacare & is anti second amendment. 
the new ebola czar will report to the wh & nsa adviser susan rice. more mismanagement & duplicity with cdc. obama is terrible executive.

@kingbronko: @realdonaldtrump mr. trump, please run for president in 2016 please 

looks like obama will not stop the very potentially dangerous flights to and from west africa. what the hell is wrong with this guy? 
.@katyperry i watched russell brand and i think his mind is fried he looks really bad. russell is a total joke, a dummy who is lost 
.@katyperry katy, what the hell were you thinking when you married loser russell brand. there is a guy who has got nothing going, a waste 

.@katyperry must have been drunk when she married russell brand @rustyrockets – but he did send me a really nice letter of apology 
i watched russell brand @rustyrockets on the @jimmyfallon show the other night—what the hell do people see in russell—a major loser 


the ebola nurse should never have been allowed to fly to cleveland and (amazing) back again. nothing works in our once great country anymore

i am starting to think that there is something seriously wrong with president obama's mental health. why won't he stop the flights. psycho 
it is time for the airline pilots, flight attendants and the airlines themselves to stop flights to and from west africa. do it right now

i just had a great victory against lightweight a.g. eric schneiderman. most of his case re trump u. was thrown out or gutted. little remains 
i can't believe that mitt romney would run for president again. he had his chance and blew it in the last weeks of the race. 
a nurse in dallas who treated ebola patient thomas duncan was allowed to fly to cleveland.she should never have been so allowed the real jv 
with all of the words president obama just dispensed at his press conference, he didn't say what we all want to hear, i'll stop the flights

young entrepreneurs – always remember in negotiations that sometimes the best deal you make is the one you walk away from. 
our president could not make a proper website with $5b. the website still does not work. how can we feel safe about ebola?

lightweight @agschneiderman is driving business & jobs out of ny. only wants self publicity—a total loser 
john @cahillforag is one of the most respected people in politics. dopey @agschneiderman is one of the least respected 
president obama has a personal responsibility to visit & embrace all people in the us who contract ebola 
obama still refuses to stop the flights. is he stubborn or just plain incompetent i say both

@intheelections: @realdonaldtrump china wouldn't be laughing at president trump. so true 

so many problems in the u.s. and leadership that is hopeless...and now, on top of everything else, we just hit $18 trillion in debt 

as isis and ebola spread like wildfire, the obama administration just submitted a paper on how to stop climate change (aka global warming). 
can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the u.s., president obama spent the day playing golf.worse than carter 
if you never want to be criticized, for goodness' sake don't do anything new. jeff bezos 
if alison grimes can’t admit she voted for obama, even if she is embarrassed, then you can’t trust her vote @team_mitch 

the military generals are fuming at obama. he has boxed them in against isis with a strategy that is destined to fail. sad

the @nfl games are so boring now that actually, i’m glad i didn’t get the bills. boring games, too many flags, too soft 
even though i refused to pay a ridiculous price for the buffalo bills, i would have produced a winner. now that won’t happen. 
the people of buffalo should be happy terry pegula got the team but i hope he does better w/the bills than he has w/the sabres. good luck

@taylorjeffrey1: @realdonaldtrump @ihunt88 yes, please do, we need somebody with a head on their shoulders & knows how to use it 
@m_forese: @realdonaldtrump we need a leader with the business smarts along with mental strength to run this country such as you i agree 

@ihunt88: i think it's about time @realdonaldtrump stands up and announces he's running for president. 
i don't know if president obama isn't stopping the flights from ebola torn west africa because he is stubborn, stupid, or just doesn't care 
here we go a healthcare worker who treated thomas duncan, the man who flew into the u.s. from west africa infected with ebola, caught it 
president obama, now, bring our 4000 innocent and ill trained soldiers home from west africa, before it is too late, and stop the flights 

@billyhaze: great interview tuesday past with jim gardner, must be a breath of fresh air speaking with such a well respected journalist 
remember when i said when saddam hussein fell the new leader of iraq will be meaner and tougher and hate the u.s. even more. welcome isis 
if a conservative republican made the mistake that mrs. obama just made by calling braley by the wrong name, it would be the biggest story 
michelle obama made a terrible mistake in iowa. when endorsing bruce braley before a large crowd, she called him bruce bailey seven times. 
isn't it ridiculous, starting today, new ebola screenings go into effect for people coming from west africa. just stop the flights dummies

obamacare puts poor people on a form of government run, single payer health insurance that many doctors don't take @avik 

obama is making the ebola problem much worse than it needs to be in the u.s. by not halting flights from west africa. airport testing a joke 



if you are interested in balancing work and pleasure, you will never succeed 


i feel sorry for the 4000 soldiers who are being forced to go the west africa to fight ebola. their families are up in arms. not trained. 
tens of millions of dollars in airstrikes had no impact because key leaders fled after hearing on news reports the strikes were coming. dumb

@brasscojones10: @realdonaldtrump i'm at the trump doral for an environmental law conference. very impressed all around. great. 
china is ripping wealth out africa and yet, as usual, refuses to put anything back to help with ebola. let the stupid americans do it sad 
the residential real estate market continues to provide opportunities for first time home owners. buy now if you can 
the cdc chief just said ebola is spreading faster than aids. marines are preparing for a pandemic drill. stop all flights from west africa 
obama won’t send troops to fight jihadists, yet sends them to liberia to contract ebola. he is a delusional failure.

i will be on fox & friends (@foxandfriends) at 7.00. fighting ebola will be a topic 
i'm not going to be watching much nfl football anymore. too time consuming, too boring, too many flags and too soft. focus on other things 
what the hell is obama doing in allowing all of these potentially very sick people to continue entering the u.s. is he stupid or arrogant? 
i don't know what it is, but i'm getting totally bored watching nfl football. too many penalties and far too soft t.v. off and back to work

president obama close down the flights from ebola infected areas right now, before it is too late what the hell is wrong with you?

something very important, and indeed society changing, may come out of the ebola epidemic that will be a very good thing: no shaking hands 
this ebola patient thomas duncan, who fraudulently entered the u.s. by signing false papers, is causing havoc. if he lives, prosecute 
@intheelections: @realdonaldtrump my advice: run for president 
if ebola is so non contagious, how come an nbc cameraman caught it so quickly while over in west africa? u.s. is behaving very foolishly 
can you believe that president obama still hasn't stopped the flights and people pouring into the u.s. from west africa. terrible president

@drugfreeblayde: @realdonaldtrump is one of the smartest men in america... put him in the office. so true, thanks 







really interesting, president obama was quick to shut down flights to isreal but is totally unwilling to shut down flights from west africa 
@not_that_actor wow andy, such amazing writing and thought. thank you 

saw michael jordan and ray allen today playing golf at trump national doral, the blue monster. great guys 
ebola patient duncan lied on his exit papers by saying he never came into contact with a person with ebola. he knew he did, and person died. 
how incompetent are our leaders allowing these ebola infected people to come into our country with all of the problems and danger entailed 
the ebola patient who came into our country knew exactly what he was doing. came into contact with over 100 people.here we go i told you so 
the brand new hotel at trump national doral has the most beautiful rooms and suites in miami. enjoy

president obama should stay out of the hong kong protests, we have enough problems in our own country can't even properly police white house 
success seems to be connected with action. successful people keep moving. they make mistakes, but they don't quit. conrad hilton 
fact obama does not read his intelligence briefings nor does he get briefed in person by the cia or dod. too busy i guess 


keep your momentum. without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere. 
i've realized that success requires 100% effort and 100% focus. nothing less. get out there and go for it.

the nfl image is really tarnished now, if the sponsors start leaving and the ratings go down, the nfl will be in big trouble. boring games 
they just called this the biggest scandal in u.s. sports history (gma). roger looks really weak and indecisive, must put on a better front 
what separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate. 
do you believe that obama is giving weapons to moderate rebels in syria.isn't sure who they are. what the hell is he doing.will turn on us 
why are we sending thousands of ill trained soldiers into ebola infested areas of africa bring the plague back to u.s.? obama is so stupid. 

roger goodell must stop apologizing to everyone who will listen and toughen up. his street smart players are laughing at him and the nfl

china's the leading exporter of iraqi oil yet they won’t lift a finger against isis. why should we do the heavy lifting for china’s gain?

i am convinced that if @alexsalmond had not pushed ugly wind turbines all over scotland, the vote would have been much better for him 
the people of scotland have spoken—a great decision. i wish @alexsalmond well & look forward to playing golf with him at aberdeen 
learn, work and think in equal proportions and you'll be going in the right direction. 
realize that persistence can go a long way. being stubborn is often an attribute.

“sometimes you have to take a half step back to take two forward.” @vincemcmahon 
the iraqi army has squandered the majority of the weapons & training we gave them for 10 long years. when will we learn? 
so obama wants to bomb isis in iraq & arm them in syria? what is he doing 
are the republicans going to blow their chance to take the senate? must focus on obamacare and amnesty.

@yankee_rangernv @realdonaldtrump don't forget you were also the only person to host wrestlemania in back to back years so true, thanks.

entrepreneurs: believe in yourself. if you don't, no one else will either. 
entrepreneurs: achievers move forward at all times. achievement is not a plateau, it's a beginning. 
i've realized that success requires 100% effort and 100% focus. nothing less. 
does anybody notice that atlantic city lost its magic after i left years ago. i had the big boxing, introduced ufc (ask dana),the best shows 
can you believe that the u.s. will be sending 3000 troops to africa to help with ebola.they will come home infected? we have enough problems 
it is so sad to see what has happened to atlantic city. so many bad decisions by the pols over the years airport, convention center, etc. 
i left atlantic city years ago, good timing. now i may buy back in, at much lower price, to save plaza & taj. they were run badly by funds 
if you can’t focus with unyielding resolve, then you will never be successful. believe in yourself and you can accomplish your goals.

@bentrolling: @realdonaldtrump @eastonwestwood donald trump has more know how, grit, and integrity than george w. bush. very true 
secretary kerry cannot get other nations to join us in fighting isis. they are afraid and he is a poor salesman who reps a pathetic leader 
@bentrolling: @realdonaldtrump @eastonwestwood disclosing his finances would make donald trump the most wealthy president ever so true 
@eastonwestwood: please run for president again america is almost finished but might have a chance if you're president in jan.2017.

i can't believe that the judge in the oscar pistorious case has found him not guilty of murder. no one has been more guilty since o.j.

@kingofpolitics: @realdonaldtrump donald in the house. you nailed it down. 
@kalozap: obama's mind, isis, ebola, etc.... and then thinking, boy i wish i was on the golf coarse. what should i wear on the links 
tell saudi arabia and others that we want (demand ) free oil for the next ten years or we will not protect their private boeing 747s.pay up 
middle eastern countries must participate militarily (no running away) and big league financially in order for us to go in and save them 
i just want to know how much is saudi arabia and others who we are helping willing to pay for our saving from total extinction. pay up now 
if obama resigns from office now, thereby doing a great service to the country—i will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses

why are we giving away our entire strategy and tactics we will deploy against isis? it puts our troops at a disadvantage.

the fact that we are taking the ebola patients, while others from the area are fleeing to the united states, is absolutely crazy stupid pols 
the u.s. must immediately stop all flights from ebola infected countries or the plague will start and spread inside our borders. act fast 
@tony351952: @realdonaldtrump u need 2 run 4 office 
@bigboie7531: to all the liberal do gooders, this is the plague you idiots no cure @ you may have confidence in the cdc, but i don't 
@tina_louise_007: @realdonaldtrump i agree 
@nicolastetrault: @realdonaldtrump i agree 100% 
@mrs_vgomez: @realdonaldtrump yes the government is bringing them back here so the outbreak can start here too 
@barbarasmayer: @realdonaldtrump you are right about the ebola patients. it's a deadly virus, and they shouldn't bring them to the us. 
@mrstraceyowen: @realdonaldtrump you want sense ? listen to @realdonaldtrump 
if you read my last number of tweets, only one opinion can be formed that our president, and therefore leader, is grossly incompetent 
the obamacare website is in the news again it is turning out to cost even more than previously thought, and it doesn't work big trouble 
so many lives and two trillion dollars wasted, and our worst enemies will get the 2nd largest oil reserves in the world. such stupid leaders 
just as i have been predicting for years, iraq will fall to the people that hate the u.s. the most just outside of baghdad. keep the oil 
the u.s. cannot allow ebola infected people back. people that go to far away places to help out are great but must suffer the consequences 
.@david_cameron why do you give scotland so much money to destroy their magnificent land with wind turbines causing massive taxes & e bills

obama should work on a ceasefire in chicago as well as gaza. 
pm @david_cameron should be run out of office for spending so much of england’s money to subsidize windfarms in scotland.

when in doubt, obama fundraises. he has held 393 fundraisers in six years. another record. 
youth unemployment is at a record high. obamacare is a job destroyer which is ruining aspiring careers. it must be repealed. 
watch – obama will not fix the illegal immigrant loophole. instead he will sign another executive action giving more amnesty. 


obama spoke to the mexican president last week & did not mention umc sgt. tahmooressi. sad

@shakystu: @realdonaldtrump @ayrshirepost @trumpturnberry nice move worth while investment. can't wait to see how well it's finished

obama wanted putin to reset. instead, putin laughed at him and reloaded. 
many people have said i’m the world’s greatest writer of 140 character sentences. 
it’s monday. how many fundraisers will obama hold today?

@ronkarkoviceff trump tower in chicago is a masterpiece that completes a gorgeous skyline thanks 

i actually enjoyed the piece re sign @thedailyshow. could it be that i’m starting to like jon stewart? 
@cycick donald trump is the king of quotes you really should listen to him thanks. 
@uconncrazy @realdonaldtrump great to hear you on @sternshow. your honesty is refreshing. thank you. 

@gootecks @primeministersx agreed, st maarten has so many issues and makes so many empty promises she's incompetent. 
@aj3fla @realdonaldtrump great job on @howardstern this week. always the best radio with the two of you. thank you. 
.@primeministersx has no clue what’s going on in st. maarten. mullet bay is a third world slum. 
resolve never to quit, never to give up, no matter what the situation. jack nicklaus 
“hook your career to a big trend. there are huge opportunities for profits if you can create big solutions.” – think big 

pm sarah westcot williams incompetence should not be rewarded. you should vote for anyone who runs against her—loser @primeministersx 
mullet bay golf course looks like a slum on the beautiful island of st. maarten. @primeministersx should be ashamed for allowing this. 
every day st. maarten loses vital tourism dollars due to the incompetence of pm sarah westcot williams. @primeministersx 
@jlk5253 @realdonaldtrump @trumpchicago i love the sign. it is tasteful and classy, just like everything you do. thank you. 

manufacturing is now less than 9% of us gdp. the rust belt, heart of our country’s factory sector, has been destroyed by our leaders. 
what took so long to catch only 1 of the benghazi terrorists? especially after the killer has been taunting the us in the press f/2 yrs. 


will the benghazi terrorist use the videotape as a defense? if so, will obama apologize to him? 
a country that cannot protect its borders is a country destined to fail. another broken promise by our leaders in washington. 

every poll shows high approval of the new sign on @trumpchicago. i am honored by the great support. 

may god have mercy upon my enemies, because i won't general george s. patton

i was right—tv ratings for us open are way down from last year. people don’t want to look at a burned out, ugly course 
@bc4040 @trumpchicago looks great @ night, i saw it saturday during the day and it also looks great in the daylight too great, thanks 
@newhopenchange @realdonaldtrump @trumptoronto @trumpchicago nicely done, it's a magnificent sign. thank you 

“no one remembers who came in second.” – walter hagen 
with our border not being secure, obama is giving a pathway to terrorists to enter our country. an attack is on him.

@mark_quoted: @realdonaldtrump reading think big and can't help but wonder why you ain't president yet? well, now is when we most need it 

@stevenowell: @realdonaldtrump don't normally agree with you but it (pinehurst) looked like an absolute dump. 
@mindgone222: @realdonaldtrump @jry227 people just want to mess with you because you're you. it's your building. f them.

@jrnicholas8: love the trump in chicago. those who don't like it are jealous capitalism is where it's at we need more signs like it 
i bought the great turnberry resort today considered by many to have the greatest golf course in the world. i will take good care of it 
@adamjannke: @realdonaldtrump went to doonbeg last year, loved it 
@joebud123: @realdonaldtrump which one of your books should i read first? the art of the deal 
@deehogan21: @realdonaldtrump along with @doonbeglodge ...heaven on earth 
@backontrackusa: remember the terrorists that obama has been arming in syria against assad. well now they are marching on bagdad. 
@backontrackusa these are the same terrorists obama has been arming in syria & have attacked us on 911.obama's foreign policy is a disaster 
@waldrop15w: @kenny_wallace @realdonaldtrump iran controlling iraq and all of its oil will be everyone's problem our leaders are stupid 
i know about the “rustic” look on golf courses—but see photo of highly rated trump national philadelphia—a real gem.pic.twitter.com/pgsw9kwvck 
success comes with hard work, focus and luck. the luck comes to those who seek it out. if you are not in the game, you cannot get lucky. 
when isis caught the soldiers, do you think they read them their legal rights prior to executing them? 
choose your own path: it doesn't have to be the path less traveled...what matters is that it's the right one for you. vince lombardi 
iraq is no longer our problem. we never should have been there in the first place 

the va scandal will only get worse over the time. our vets deserve the best care possible. we must be open to private solutions. 
congratulations to @spurs on their @nba championship. well deserved. 
if anybody else but coore and crenshaw designed pinehurst they would be run out of town—(and the turtleback greens are totally unfair) 
the only reason i am critical of the pinehurst look is because i’m a lover of golf—and that look on tv hurts golf badly.

@theramenes: get @realdonaldtrump into wh he can lead and fix anything he is also strong and unafraid to do what is good for people.

@joshburrnett: if hilary clinton runs for office. @realdonaldtrump has too. or i'm moving to canada 
@davidcanlas88: i wish you would advice the kardashians and the jenner sisters on child rearing. you did a good job upbringing your girl. 
@thespinepillow: @realdonaldtrump please run for prez. would b great to have a real man in the white house again. 
@jeniferstevens: awful look to it.....not like trump in palm beach and briarcliff or scotland that i've played. your courses are the best 

@magnumcj: @realdonaldtrump told the truth all day about pinehurst 2. it is just not a good looking us open course. so true 
@deannaspillyard: chicago should be so lucky to have the king of new york invest in their city love the sign it should be bigger jmo 
@drake4444444: @realdonaldtrump we need trump 1) in the nfl, 2) in the oval office, and 3) on his own reality show. cute 

@quotedojo: a little more moderation would be good. of course, my life hasn't exactly been one of moderation. ~donald trump 
@gja360: @realdonaldtrump i read all of your books you truly are an inspiration thanks. 
@troytreanor: @shanebacon which got more viewers: final round of @usopengolf or @realdonaldtrump tweets about the course? trump 
@surayazayn: @realdonaldtrump i find yourself and your children exemplary and inspirational, sir. thank you. 
big announcement tomorrow morning concerning the great turnberry resort in scotland 

@bensext0n: @cfeetsrevenge @lukedonald @realdonaldtrump course didn't look good in hd just saying no, it looked terrible, bad for golf 
@tedataca: i concur with @realdonaldtrump on pinehurst. imo: those blasts from sandy areas looked like ieds exploding in kandahar province. 
@ichicagoscott: @realdonaldtrump it was nice of you to give @mattginellagc 15 minutes of fame that he wouldn't have had. i agree 
@welsh @realdonaldtrump you have made some great courses, but dont think that gives you the right to comment on every golf course i agree 
@mattginellagc matt, how many club championships have you won? i hear zero, or 18 fewer than me lets play for a lot? 
@ic @mattginellagc stick to media like everyone else in it with worthless opinions. donaldtrump is 10,000 times more successful than you. 
@golfermatt23: @realdonaldtrump are the @mastercard commercials filmed at trump national la? yes. 
@matthewhkurth: @realdonaldtrump played trump bedminster once...will never forget it. 
@zackalcorn: @mikehyland21 @realdonaldtrump @aec4444 big time. i love trump bedminster 
@g3stover: @mattginellagc is barking up the wrong tree getting in a twitter war with @realdonaldtrump i can beat him in golf even easier 
@mattginellagc matt, you know nothing about quality golf or what it takes to make golf successful. you are all talk, no substance 
@rink914: @ianjamespoulter actually agree...it may have been great to play but it looked atrocious on tv..i love golf..couldn't watch 
@charliemaikis: @realdonaldtrump i completely agree with dt here. pinehurst looks bad. i wouldn't pay $400 to play if it looked like that. 

@vmisciagna: @realdonaldtrump i've played the new doral which is awesome one day i hope to play another trump course 
@jeffokrina: @cbssports @eyeongolf @realdonaldtrump: i agree with the donald. what a goat track i'll take the beauty of pebble any day 
@clarksmidt: sir donald. rather than promote golf courses, please use your influence to deliver messages that will help fix our country. 
@aec4444: @realdonaldtrump i've played pinehurst and trump bedminster and donald has 2 in bedminister that are superior. thank you & true 
@mattginellagcsadly matt, you don't understand golf (even though you think you do).i have numerous couses that are far superior to pinehurst 
@mattginellagc i have watched open championships at turnberry, one of the great golf courses of the world. pinehurst not in the same league 
@mattginellagc my position on pinehurst is correct bad for the game, a dried out cow pasture. you have no clue but keep trying 
johnny miller correctly very critical of greens at pinehurst. said they should be redone 

@jackhennessy12: @realdonaldtrump look better at lahinch or trump doonbeg? true 
@aec4444: @realdonaldtrump please don't let the usga ruin your course in 2017 like they did pinehurst. i won't 
@robert_w_ga: @realdonaldtrump they think the course should be old school , you know, like before lawn care technology aka goats 
i'd bet the horrible look of pinehurst translates into poor television ratings. this is not what golf is about 
@foossh:@golfdigestmag @realdonaldtrump he has a point, fairways should be green. scruff can be as bad as you want. wouldn't pay top dollar 
@mommom: just saw the video of the bus driver saving the woman from jumping off overpass. you gave him a reward....good job donald thanks 
@epowell88: worked @ restaurant for 33 yrs & got fired because they didn't think i could keep up. no severance would u do that? no way 
@markmoreland: it's worse for @pinehurstresort. i know i wouldn't pay $400 to play what looks like a neglected municipal course. 
@timgerzabek: @realdonaldtrump @golfdigestmag i thought this was the us open not the wanna be british open 
@jshamie: @golfdigestmag couldn't agree more. the course is not punishing bad tee shots like a normal us open would. boring finish 
@golfdigestmag big news from scotland on turnberry (which, by the way, blows pinehurst away ) tomorrow morning. stay tuned. 
@golfdigestmag never in the history of televised golf has a course looked so bad and unattractive. a dry, burnt out mess bad for golf. 
.@hollysandersgc. remember, it was martin k who sank the big ten footer to win the ryder cup. he can handle the pressure 
i would like to wish all fathers, even the haters and losers, a very happy fathers day. 
@zp_3: @realdonaldtrump happy birthday from your trump towers in west palm. keep up the good work a great place, thanks.

@seancourt: @realdonaldtrump we need a great leader like @realdonaldtrump to take this country where it belongs 


@der_karsten: @realdonaldtrump happy birthday to the best businessman in the world thank you. 

@jsimonwc: @mattginellagc @realdonaldtrump built for golf. not built for tv. that is true because it looks horrible on t.v. sad 
.@blairkamin blair, you may be the worst architectural critic in the business but thanks for your nice reviews about trump chicago & sign pr 

@pgongola: @realdonaldtrump @mattginellagc i think pinehurst is ugly. 

.@mattginellagc have you ever seen trump national/bedminster or trump international golf links in scotland. both far better than pinehurst 

.@mattginellagc matt, the statement about pinehurst looking like a local community golf course, awful , was not made by me but tweeted to me 
.@mattginellagc it's true matt, the new blue monster is better than pinehurst, so is bedminster. turnberry & trump aberdeen blow it away 
@tx_shaun: @realdonaldtrump happy birthday donald thanks for never being afraid to tell it like it is 



@doughutchins77: @realdonaldtrump the world just won't be safe until the name trump is emblazoned on the white house. 
@dbigrock34: @realdonaldtrump like i said, trump for president. usa needs a positive change. 
@scleroshima: @realdonaldtrump you called it about 4 years ago about the spoils of war its all coming true now. so true 
@commishjoe: happy birthday to successful businessman and true american success story. he certainly tells it like it is thank you. 
@glock34girl: @realdonaldtrump please run and get america back on its feet. stay tuned 

i have been very consistent and always said that iraq would fall as soon as the u.s. left. what a terrible waste of lives and money 
iran will convince our incompetent president that they are trying to help us with iraq, take over the country & oil, and o will say thanks 
turnberry in scotland is a far superior golf course to pinehurst and it isn't even close likewise the blue monster at doral. 
iran is moving troops into iraq under the guise that it is helping out. actually, they will take over iraq and all of their oil. stupid u.s. 
@moshoodaluko: happy birthday to an american icon and a real estate el supremo... @realdonaldtrump thanks.

the iraqi army is useless. president obama, stay the hell out of iraq (we should never have been there in the first place). 
@thisisjoshsmith: i'll say it you are likely the *only* republican who could realistically beat hillary in 2016. please consider running 
@austinwalsh: @realdonaldtrump new sign looks awesome congrats 
@russell_triston: @realdonaldtrump would make a great commander in chief. true intelligence. common sense, economy knowledge, leadership. 
we should never have gone into iraq but, once in, should have gotten out a lot faster. make america great again 
@don_ekwegba: when mr. trump wants to get at something he goes all the way. he walks the talk. there are only a few of them left thank you 
@nikkio: i know i'm a day early for your weekend celebrations happy birthday donald looking forward to your surprises for 2014 2015 thanks 

@tstreck: @realdonaldtrump great building. name looks awesome on it. 
@artv1028: @blairkamin @chicagotribune you don't like it because trump is a conservative. how many jobs has trump created in chicago 
@aureliusjb: @realdonaldtrump mr. trump, i love your sign, it really spiffs up that stodgy old town. keep up the great style statements. 


@laura711hender: @realdonaldtrump live in the suburbs but saw the trump sign on your beautiful building. really classy love it 

@annmajkrzak: @ap @cbschicago i like the trump logo on the building i feel this is a personal fight & will this fight cost il residents 
@nickkleutsch: @realdonaldtrump @trumpchicago personally i think the letters should be higher up. make sure everyone can see that name 
@majesticbrotha: @realdonaldtrump i'm a liberal but i feel mayor emanual has bigger fish to fry in chi town than a trump sign 
@loveandfate: @realdonaldtrump your name on your building in chicago looks awesome 
@jamesbregenzer @trumpchicago was completed during recession, when most other projects failed. trump deserves chicago's praise @blairkamin 
dopey @chicagotribune critic fails to mention the ugly sun times sign. 
before i bought the site, the sun times had the biggest, ugliest sign chicago has ever seen. mine is magnificent and popular.

@ep_capital @reformedbroker @philiprucker @realdonaldtrump yo that sign gonna be more famous than hollywood i agree 
in answer to your questions about my favorite impersonator, the answer is darrell hammond. 
people are loving the trump sign on the chicago building. big league tweets, letters and calls… 
a third rate architecture critic who i thought got fired—for the failing @chicagotribune likes the building but doesn’t like the trump sign 
@awoodylou: @realdonaldtrump you are an inspiration to us all. if only you would run for president and sort all this shit out. 
@stac: following @realdonaldtrump was one of the best decisions i've made on twitter. love the way he speaks his mind and no sugar coating 
i told all of the haters and losers long ago that iraq would fall, take the oil or get out fast massive waste of lives and trillions of $'s 
iraq told us to get out, iraq is now falling, and iraq now wants us to come back don't do it unless we get the oil, and i mean all of it 

@efprestopreston: @realdonaldtrump run, donald, run 
@dbigrock34: @realdonaldtrump run for president, you got my vote 
iraq is falling apart fast two trillion dollars and so many deaths bush got us in and obama took far too long to get us out 
@mmmkamilla: i have never voted before, but if mr.trump ran for president, i would love nothing more than for my first vote to go to him. 

btw the miss usa pageant was the highest rated non sports telecast on the big 4 networks. congrats to our newly crowned @nia_sanchez_

@bravofan2014: @realdonaldtrump @misscassie1230 he has my vote we need an patriot in the white house again. 
@zahmad_a:it is the haste decision of withdrawing troops from iraq w/o having a fully prepared iraqi army. wrong, they could never do it 
@misscassie1230: @realdonaldtrump for president smarter than any man in the usa i agree, thanks 
iraq is far worse and of more danger to the u.s. now than it ever was under saddam hussein and this after $2 trillion and so many lives 
@pamplinfilmco: @realdonaldtrump @jenn641 can't wait 2 see the white house makeover when trump is president. our country would thrive 
@retrogirl01 he sure has my vote it's time we get someone in there that has a brain a business mind to clean this mess up thank you

@askmrwhitey: @realdonaldtrump you have the finances and the name. and we have the votes... get on it. lets make it happen. 
what i am saying is that we never should have been in iraq in the first place. bush was terrible, obama is worse make america great again. 
@lovebautistafan: @realdonaldtrump @trumptoronto @mdamelincourt by far the best hotel i've ever stayed at mr. d is tremendous. 
i told you so a long time ago: iraq just lost second largest city as their soldiers drop their guns and run. only the beginning oil. 



@schwabbieman: @realdonaldtrump amateurs... unfortunate but true. true, our leader is clueless 

@_tregun: @realdonaldtrump iraq, afghanistan, pakistan: o's foreign policy (or lack thereof) fails repeatedly. 
@shousman86: @realdonaldtrump mr. trump please build our military and take care of our vets as commander in chief this would happen 
@joebannas: @realdonaldtrump there are no friends over there , you can not trust anybody. they where probably set up . get our boys out 
@pierscomments: the only strong leader that the republicans have at the moment is donald trump. 
five u.s. soldiers killed in afghanistan by so called friendly fire. what are we doing? 
@david_j_roth: i was never one who looked at success as bad. for me, success was always good. i loved it, and still do. donald trump

heading over to the miss usa pageant. the young women participating are amazing and accomplished. competition is very tough. enjoy the show 
the man made climate change that our great president should be focused on is of the nuclear variety brought upon us because of weakness 
the miss u.s.a. pageant will be amazing tonight. to be politically incorrect, the girls (women) are really beautiful. nbc at 8 pm. 
@killen2015: if @realdonaldtrump ran for president in 2016,i'd totally vote for him.we need a business man to get the economy back on track

@donaldtrump2016: @realdonaldtrump if you were in washington this country would be in better shape wow, thank you for caring so much 
@tbrandy100:how about bush? he lied about iraq and wmd's. cost us 4000 lives i agree, i think he was also a terrible president 

no president in history has lied to the american people more than president obama in fact, it is not even close 
@geraldbjohnson: @realdonaldtrump i would vote for trump we need discipline, intelligence, and most of all strength he would bring all 3 
remember, the terrible 5 for 1 trade whereby the taliban got back leaders (killers) and we got back a nothing, will come back to haunt u.s. 
the same brilliant negotiators that gave up five taliban leaders for one traitor are now making trade deals with china & others.no chance 

@advertina: @realdonaldtrump. would you be aggressive as president? not aggressive, smart 
@ams_world: @realdonaldtrump its embarrassing, yet no one seems to know how to turn our country around. a bunch of clueless leaders. true 
@flightaj: @realdonaldtrump are you running for president? watch 


@tegodreaux: @realdonaldtrump not on your watch mr. president... 100% true 
we have to make the u.s.a. rich again so that we can afford to pay social security, medicare,and medicaid and strong to keep our enemies out 
@lpgranier: thank you for coming to louisiana & bringing $$$ first with your incredible speech at rlc & now miss usa you rock thanks

i am in baton rouge where the miss usa pageant will be shown live on nbc on sunday night for 3 hours starting at 8 p.m. incredible show 
the owner of california gold just made a jerk (fool) out of himself. just smile and congrat the winner. his wife was visibly embarrassed 
.@andrewkreig thank you andrew so correct 
will be in louisiana for the miss usa pageant which will be on nbc on sunday night. watch miss pennsylvania,an interesting and amazing story 

@summersmarcus: @realdonaldtrump always my role model thank you. 



obama is, without question, the worst ever president. i predict he will now do something really bad and totally stupid to show manhood 
“learn, know, and show. it’s a proven formula. put it to use starting today.” – think like a champion 
breaking news: obama has just made a trade with russia. they get florida, california & our gold supply. we get borscht & a bottle of vodka. 


@gleisissantos reading @realdonaldtrump 's think like a champion . what a great and inspirational book. thanks, good luck 
@ry_ceo: @realdonaldtrump i always tell people to vote for donald trump if he runs for president. he knows the real deal 
@eriksson: call it any way you like, but snowden is a traitor. when our country was great do you know what we did to traitors?” 
@elchucacabra: @realdonaldtrump obama can strike a deal with the taliban, but can't make a deal with congress. 
@boycottmaypac: @realdonaldtrump he got the president to show his birth certificate he has clout my friend he can really stir things up 
i believe that in addition to the 5 terrorist leaders president obama gave up for bergdahl, a great deal of cash was also given. so stupid 



congratulations to @joniernst on her impressive @iowagop primary win last night. now all should unite & defeat bruce braley this november 

@icheko_lom all mr. @realdonaldtrump is trying to do is wake everyone up to the truth. loving the tweets. thank you. 
@mikeygojca @realdonaldtrump speaks the truth and is as successful as he is... must be doing something right. i guess so, thanks 
@_lizzly nearly anything would be more effective than obama. @realdonaldtrump is the ideal candidate for this country's restoration thx. 
obama can release 5 senior taliban for a deserter but can’t make mexico release decorated marine sgt. andrew tahmooressi. pathetic 
obama betrays israel yet again, our strongest ally in the middle east. he will recognize hamas, breaking long standing us policy. 

.@trumplasvegas' 7th floor provides the most urbane feel in las vegas w/private air conditioned cabanas & a massive 110 ft. heated pool. 
@nklaeger we need a successful business person to upright the usa...no rookies. trump is the man to do it thanks, i agree 
@dbljjames @realdonaldtrump will you be in baton rouge for miss usa yes 
i hope we never find life on other planets because there's no doubt that the u.s. government will start sending them money 

if you like to work hard, you will attract people with the same ethic. think like a billionaire 
chris mcdaniel looks like he will win in mississippi great news and big victory for tea party 
obama never consulted with congress about a prisoner exchange. he broke the law and should be tried. our president is a total disaster 
are you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence? 
was susan rice told to lie about bergdahl? obama and his representatives lie about virtually everything, from obamacare to a deserter. 
.@newsbusters thank you for a great and very accurate story well done 
@tquoteseday: if you're interested in 'balancing' work and pleasure, stop instead make your work more pleasurable. donald trump 
rapidly failing @vanityfair magazine hits me for my strong stance against obama's brilliant 5 killers for 1 deserter trade. amazing 
@wolf_hausmann: what separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate. donald trump 
the five taliban leaders released for a deserter must really be laughing and having a good time right now. they are saying how dumb u.s. is 
our president is a great embarrassment to the u.s. how could anybody be so dumb or know so little as to make the very stupid 5 for 1 swap?

it would be nice if our commander in chief was as concerned for our veterans health as he is for illegal immigrants becoming citizens. 
moving forward f/tonight’s competitive primaries, it is crucial that the tea party & @gop remain united towards november. take the senate 
@lisav27 @realdonaldtrump i want you mr. trump as the president well, we'd better get someone fast the u.s. is going down fast.

obama’s war on coal is killing american jobs, making us more energy dependent on our enemies & creating a great business disadvantage. 
be sure to buy this month’s @amspec magazine. read “a trump card,” my interview with jeffrey lord. 
because of our terrible leaders, it is now open season on every american throughout the world. terrorists are thrilled. 
president said we would never leave a soldier behind. how about the 4 who died in benghazi? 
great deal, we swap 5 killer terrorists for a u.s. military deserter. that’s how the u.s. negotiates nowadays. 
@taylor_mcbath obama is actively destroying the greatest country in the world. we are going to pay a horrible price for his recent actions 
@ralphige: who knew al qaeda had such good negotiators. impressive 5 for 1 against the mighty usa @realdonaldtrump 
bowe bergdahl walked off the base after he was told not to. solders died looking for him. u.s. should never have made the deal punishment? 

that the obama administration didn't know the facts about who bergdahl was before making the stupid 5 killers for one trade is pathetic 
@mrcurvywor @realdonaldtrump enjoyed seeing you on @letterman you should run for president you would get this great country going again 
@alextbailey: @realdonaldtrump @letterman if you run as donald trump and not a democrat or republican, the people will vote for you

@happygirl71929: @realdonaldtrump if you don't run in 2016..... i'm moving to canada..... please help us mr. trump don't move so fast 
at some point sgt. bergdahl will have to explain his capture. in 2009 he simply wandered off his base without a weapon. many questions 
@maathewdavis: @realdonaldtrump please run for president to save america. my whole family is knows you’re the only man who can do it true 
@joydacus84: @realdonaldtrump not long, obama plays with our emotion's knowing we all love to see this soldier come home. stupid man

@mappleby747: trump 2016 we need someone who not only wants to change this country but can change this country. @realdonaldtrump thanks. 
@fergton: @realdonaldtrump when the released prisoners kill americans what does obama say to their parents? 
@kylegolfmtnbike: @realdonaldtrump wonder how long it takes the released terrorists to attack americans? 
@rbrohammer: just watched your speech at the national press club. fantastic as usual. please consider 2016. we need fantastic leadership 
@awew: @realdonaldtrump now the enemy knows that capturing soldiers is worth it b/c our idiot president will give them what they want. 
the u.s. cannot negotiate with terrorists. it is a sad and terrible situation for the family involved, but this can only lead to disaster. 
@chazkshand: @realdonaldtrump run for president we need a leader, not a politician so true 
president obama created a very bad precedent by handing over five taliban prisoners in exchange for sgt. bowe bergdahl. another u.s. loss 
@versongoetrix: @realdonaldtrump if you run for president i will absolutely vote for you and so will my family/friends ~ great

the ring announcers are working hard to justify the mayweather victory. they should be ashamed of themselves a total joke. 
no wonder boxing is close to dead 
crowd is booing the hell out of that phony decision place is angry and going wild. fight was not even close disgusting. 
the mayweather decision is a disgrace 
no way, judges say mayweather won. investigation should take place. fix? 
fight is over mayweather lost big but lets see what judges say 
mayweather is getting absolutely killed 
floyd mayweather is being beaten up badly through 10 rounds by marcos maidana, but announcers say it is even. two rounds left. 
the reporter that called kevin durant mr. unreliable should be fired or, at least, apologize. he is a truly great player and a winner 
there must be a higher standard of accuracy in the media. incredible that some so called journalists can make up lies and get away with it 

@double_a2011: yoo @beyonce and jayz on the runtour tickets are way to high they think everywhere got donald trump money not good

@williamcarneyii: @realdonaldtrump i couldn't agree with you more. terrible decision by nbc. seth just doesn't have it 
seth myers is so unnatural and uncomfortable doing his show that you have to feel sorry for him. bad interviewer, marbles in his mouth

@michaelgferrara i don't agree with you most of the time but people are absolutely twisting your comments to suit their agenda thx true 
@foxesba i knew the mainstream media was going to selectively hear what you were saying as i listened to your interview. so did i 

dopey @ariannahuff should force her reporters to be accurate—if she has that power. 
it’s important to listen to what people say. “horrible” and “disgusting” are the words i used in response to sterling’s comments. 
it is also amazing how comments can be edited to provide statements that are used in a knowingly incorrect manner.

once the tragic mistake of going into iraq was made, we should have at least taken the oil (or at least some of it). now iran & china get it 
after thousands lost and spending two trillion dollars, iraq (i told you so) is imploding. really dumb pols put us and kept us there so sad 
“there can be no liberty unless there is economic liberty.” margaret thatcher 
if america unlocked its energy potential, we would once again be the most powerful country in the world. washington is holding us back. 
obama told medvedev after the ’12 reelect, he would “have more flexibility.” it was music to putin’s ears. 
the biggest winner of obama’s ’08 win vladimir putin. ultimately he could be tied with iran after tehran becomes a nuclear power. 
a storied franchise with a loyal fanbase, @buffalobills should remain in buffalo.

entrepreneurs: be cautiously optimistic. call it positive thinking with a lot of reality checks.

@johnrich: one thing about @realdonaldtrump he never sugar coats anything...i'm sure @arseniohall is appreciative, as am i. thanks john 

@tx_shaun: @realdonaldtrump its true, he didn't get his show until after he won the apprentice 
@alexarancio: @arseniohall doesn't mention apprentice because his ego won't let him. it's why he failed originally and will fail again 
@tarrkoziara: @realdonaldtrump @arseniohall the apprentice has started and revived a lot of people's careers. very true 
.@arseniohall how quickly people forget, but not me you told me that without the apprentice you could never have gotten your show sad 
.@arseniohall the only thing you don't mention in the nice esquire piece about you is the apprentice, without which you would be nowhere 
@princessdaytura @realdonaldtrump for president it's reality, he is reality and he is the only one capable of making the necessary changes 
to all haters and losers: i am not anti vaccine, but i am against shooting massive doses into tiny children. spread shots out over time. 
to all young (and old) entrepreneurs: believe in yourself, talk yourself up energize yourself and you'll energize others. 
@hrvstfoundation @realdonaldtrump @samjabbo the art of the deal gets my vote. it changed the way i do business. great 
@realmikepalumbo walked in trump tower for the first time this week.. gorgeous (as all your work). love the trump experience thank you. 
entrepreneurs: believe in yourself. if you don’t, no one else will either. realize that becoming an entrepreneur is not a group effort. 
entrepreneurs: another question to ask yourself—“what am i pretending not to see?” there may be great opportunities right around you. 
for entrepreneurs: a good question to ask yourself –“what can i provide that does not yet exist?” 
@samjabbo @realdonaldtrump i haven't read any of your books yet, which one should i start with? the art of the deal is a good start.

coach w to his basketball players be quick but don't hurry 
@bossman140: @realdonaldtrump the most brilliant observation you have ever made. parents should take your advice 
if i were president i would push for proper vaccinations but would not allow one time massive shots that a small child cannot take autism. 
@ctsa: @realdonaldtrump when i was a kid, there were 8. now they give upwards of 31 40. it's an assault on the immune system. 
autism way up i believe in vaccinations but not massive, all at once, shots. too much for small child to handle. govt. should stop now

@wesbart53: watched his speech yesterday...pathetic. carter esque, weak. his delivery is so cautious not to offend, absolutely zero true 
this is the time for the united states to be strengthening all important military components not rolling over and dealing from weakness 
not good or smart for obama to be calling russia a regional power or to mention the concept of a nuclear weapon going off in nyc. 
president obama looks absolutely exhausted in the netherlands. he is not a natural leader, was never ment to lead it is tough work for him 
he that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else. benjamin franklin

@jvickersdc staying at trump international resort in miami. well done sir. wish we could stay a couple more days great family vaca thx 
@angelproroofing @trumpdoral i've had the pleasure of staying here with my family talk about exclusive service best resort by far. thanks. 


obama should stop running down the stairs when getting off air force one. doesn’t look presidential and at some point he will take a fall. 
i wonder if apple is upset with me for hounding them to produce a large screen iphone. i hear they will be doing it soon—long overdue. 
obama must now focus, get his mind off march.madness , and lead watch russia closely, work hard on the economy and get rid of obamacare 
the situation with russia is much more dangerous than most people may think and could lead to world war iii. we need great leadership fast 
we should be building up our military and our missile defense systems to their highest levels ever. must be very strong to prosper & survive 
i believe putin will continue to re build the russian empire. he has zero respect for obama or the u.s. 
putin has become a big hero in russia with an all time high popularity. obama, on the other hand, has fallen to his lowest ever numbers. sad 
great advice from my mother: “trust in god and be true to yourself.” – mary macleod trump 
great advice from my father: know everything you can about what you're doing. fred c. trump 
continuous effort not strength or intelligence is the key to unlocking our potential. winston churchill 
president obama, be cool, be smart, be sharp and focus (no more march madness), and you can beat putin at his own game. it can be done 
while putin is scheming and beaming on how to take over the world, president obama is watching march madness (basketball) 
i don't hate obama at all, i just think he is an absolutely terrible president, maybe the worst in our history 
we're spending a fortune looking for the lost plane with mostly chinese passengers, and that's ok but how much are russia & china spending? 
president obama was able to fool the americans by getting elected, but not able to fool vladimir putin. too bad for us 
failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently. henry ford 
things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out. john wooden 

@cheezitscat: .@realdonaldtrump what is ur favorite plane? boeing 757 and citation x. 
looks like plane may have been found in the indian ocean off the coast of australia.

it's not climate change,it's global warming.don't let the dollar sucking wiseguys change names midstream because the first name didn't work 
do you think john kerry is aware of the fact that they are building nuclear weapons in iran and north korea and pakistan already has them 
do you believe this one secretary of state john kerry just stated that the most dangerous weapon of all today is climate change. laughable 
@tahanna: @realdonaldtrump hope one day we'll be honoring you on presidents day. so nice 
don't let the global warming wiseguys get away with changing the name to climate change because the facts do not let gw tag to work anymore

@emanuelcenerini: @realdonaldtrump i think americans know that you would be a great president..no possibility for the others thanks 
in politics, and sometimes in life, friends come and go, but enemies accumulate 
now that the obamacare website contractor has been terminated for obvious incompetence, is the person who hired them going to be fired? 
president obama just fired the obamacare website builder. my question is, why were they hired in the first place? sue them for damages 
the brand new blue monster just opened at trump national doral miami. also, great new driving range which is open 'till midnight. go see 
@billdmeyer1971: @gretawire @realdonaldtrump @foxnews we need him as governor... this state is a mess.....

@kevinrleyland: @realdonaldtrump has it been more than you ever expected? far more and far better 
tomorrow is the 10 year anniversary of the apprentice, one of the biggest hits in television history. how time flies 
why didn’t gates resign if he was so unhappy about what he was being told by obama? the fact is, iraq etc. have always been disasters 
while i am a critic of president obama, i hate it when someone (robert gates) writes a self serving negative book about his boss. 
please, @21club, go back to your original menu and preparation. believe me, it was much better. let me know when the change is made 
identify your goals. know precisely what you want to achieve, study the best people in your field,and then plan the best route for success. 
remember to think big by expanding your horizons at the same time you're expanding your net worth. 
achievers move forward at all times. don't tread water. get out there and go for it. 
stay confident even when something bad happens. it is just a bump in the road. it will pass. think big 
congratulations to @bretbaier on his five year anniversary as the anchor @specialreport. brett is great 
looking forward to hosting the @floridagop “house majority 2014 golf tournament” at trump int'l west palm beach on jan. 27th.

@secaucus00: @realdonaldtrump respect your tweets i listen and share with my kids thanks bob. 
we are experiencing the coldest weather in more than two decades most people never remember anything like this. global warming anyone? 
have your own vision & stick with it. don't be afraid to be unique.every day is an opportunity to show what you can do at the highest level. 
entrepreneurs: set the example and you'll be a magnet for the right people. great leaders determine the teams they assemble. 
sec of state kerry said we would not go back to iraq. we shouldn’t, but he should not have said that. so stupid 
another one of my predictions just came true iraq is a total disaster with government losing all control—so sad. 


@drake4444444 the only way to fix health care crisis is for you to run for pres & bring common sense back to govt thx. 
@jorgekb @trumpdoral blue monster should be top 10 best courses this year amazing course layout thank you. 
most of the world's great riders are at mar a lago today for the trump invitational, one of the most important equestrian events of the year 

“the future is always beginning now.” mark strand, former poet laureate 
record snowfall & freezing temps throughout the country. where is global warming when you need it? 
welcome to the new obamacare reality – doctor spent 2 hours on hold w/insurance company to get approval for surgeryhttp://cbsloc.al/1e0td9e  



try to develop a tempo when you're working momentum is something you have to work at to maintain, & is an important element of success. 
a regular part of your day should be devoted to expanding your horizons. learning is a new beginning. 
i know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor. henry david thoreau 
“invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the attack.” sun tzu 
snowden should come back to america and face justice. instead, he is begging for clemency from moscow. treat him as a spy. 
it's jan. 2. president obama should end his vacation early & get back to washington to straighten out the obamacare catastrophe or end it. 
thinking big is the driving force that has forged all the great achievements in modern life. think big 
entrepreneurs are visionaries in some respects they look beyond the present. keep that in mind when looking for opportunities. 

@hunterbalthazor: @realdonaldtrump if you ran for president you got my vote. fix the country thanks 
@lutherice: @realdonaldtrump ties are amazing, very well made

@ma22dogs: @realdonaldtrump @trumplasvegas the rooms are like condos. perfect for families. very accommodating staff. thanks 
@rayleebates: @realdonaldtrump don for prez thank you. 
@noahshappy: @realdonaldtrump very true comment donald, i'm glad we have people like you in this day and age 
@melemallory: @realdonaldtrump you know it's actually called climate change, right? that's only because global warming wasn't working 
@screenplaywritr: @realdonaldtrump is al gore on that ship? 
this very expensive global warming bullshit has got to stop. our planet is freezing, record low temps,and our gw scientists are stuck in ice 
today is the first day of the rest of your life make the most of it 
have a happy, successful and healthy new year 
when it comes to money, finance and even life, protect the downside and the upside will take care of itself 
make sure to have fun and celebrate nye with friends and family. happy new year everyone 
“tomorrow is the first blank page of a 365 page book. write a good one.” — @bradpaisley 

spend your last day of 2013 contemplating the moves you will make in 2014 to make it your best year ever 
the con artists changed the name from global warming to climate change when global warming was no longer working and credibility was lost 
what the hell is going on with global warming. the planet is freezing, the ice is building and the g.w. scientists are stuck a total con job 
entrepreneurs – be tough, resolute & trustworthy. the most crucial time to build your reputation is when you start making deals.

@suegriffiths19 been a bit quiet lately? told my job is at risk ny any tips to cheer me up? be positive, do your best 
congratulations to @woodyjohnson4 and @nyjets on yesterday's very exciting game. 
cover your bases know everything you can about what you're doing. keep your focus by being well informed on a daily basis. 
ask yourself, is this a blip or is it a catastrophe? and your equilibrium will be kept in check if/when hard times hit. 
be tough, be focused. there are a lot of ups and downs, but you can ride them out if you're prepared for them. 

temperature at record lows in many parts of the country. 50 degrees below zero with wind chill in large area. global warming folks iced in 
in the upcoming new year we will focus like never before if we do that we will have complete and total victory in all we do 
we're coming up on the new year it is really important that, despite so many stupid decisions being made in washington, we make it best ever 
the global warming scientists don't want to be airlifted off the ship they are having too much fun and that is too simple a solution fame 
we should be focused on clean and beautiful air not expensive and business closing global warming a total hoax 
the rescue icebreaker, trying to free the ship of the global warming scientists, has turned back the ice is massive (a record). ironic 
@humorinstitute: i could sleep tonight if you told me we will see @therealroseanne on celebrity apprentice before i die. she would be great 
will be working with contractors at trump national doral in miami today. 
@proudlysa: thank you for your response we live in a beautiful country & invite you to visit we will host you & show you the beauty 
@proudlysa as a major fan of nelson mandela and the people of south africa, all of my statements are made with love. protect his legacy now 

be on time. wasting other people's time due to poor planning and thoughtlessness will only leave a bad impression. think like a champion 
it is really too bad that the scientists studying global warming in antarctica got stuck on their icebreaker because of massive ice and cold 



do your homework. wasting other people's time due to poor planning will only leave a bad impression. think like a billionaire 
o.k., christmas is over, now we can all go back to the wars of life. focus, focus, focus never accept defeat push hard for total victory 
i hope everybody is having a fantastic christmas no matter how tough things may seem remember that you will ride it out & go on to victory 
the new pope is a humble man, very much like me, which probably explains why i like him so much 
merry christmas, have an amazing day 
@bayojay: “@realdonaldtrump: “after every setback, start thinking big as soon as possible.” think big” true

entrepreneurs: put everything you've got into what you're doing. be totally focused nothing should be haphazard. 
entrepreneurs: whatever happens, you're responsible. if it doesn't happen, you're responsible.

@mrsdfrizzo7 good thing about trump..not a snob. a straight arrow w/street sense. appeals to the masses..a leader all can appreciate thx. 
always try to learn from other peoples mistakes, not your own it is much cheaper that way 
sometimes your best investments are the ones you don't make 
did you ever not do something that had you done it would have turned out to be a disaster. never look back, just learn from your experience 
realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort. you're in charge everything starts with you. 
entrepreneurs: be ready for problems you'll have them every day. keep open to new ideas that's where innovation begins.

personally, i think douglas durst's brother got screwed by douglas no wonder he's angry. 
.@agschneiderman why is douglas durst allowed to use the freedom tower to get out of a lease with conde nast? 
.@richard_meier, a highly overrated architect, has had many problems with buildings he has designed. 
secret service members on break from obama’s $4m vacation are more than welcomed to relax at hawaii’s top hotel @trumpwaikiki. 
lightweight @agschneiderman is pushing for the moreland commission to be disbanded immediately because he is being looked at 
guess what, folks the obamacare website just went down again. what a disaster. 
if you can’t adapt to new situations then you will never be successful. every change is a new opportunity to use your talent.

pres. obama is about to embark on a 17 day vacation in his ‘native’ hawaii, putting secret service away from families on christmas. aloha 
no cuts to welfare, no cuts to food stamps & not a single cut to obamacare, yet the new budget cuts military benefits. sad 

i am so honored by all the great ny state repubs who came to my office, called & wrote for me to run for governor. if i do, i will win. 
new york republican leader @edwardfcox is pushing my friend @robastorino into political suicide. results won’t be pleasant

the coolest story is that john beale, the man who headed up climate change for the government, is a proven con man and total phoney.arrested 
the more time you spend feeling sorry for yourself, the more time you waste after a setback. move on and quickly embrace the next challenge 

for all of those that think life is easy & don’t want to work, remember: hope is the poor man’s bread. 
alternatives are important but first repubs must repeal obamacare. it's an unsustainable monstrosity that's destroying our healthcare. 
the trump signature collection is the best menswear design for young entrepreneurs. great style & design exclusively available @macys.

we should be focusing on beautiful, clean air & not on wasteful & very expensive global warming bullshit china & others are hurting our air 
they call it climate change now because the words global warming didn't work anymore. same people fighting hard to keep it all going 
59% of the united states, by area, is now covered in snow highest % in many years. the global warming name isn't working anymore sorry 
wow, it's snowing in isreal and on the pyramids in egypt. are we still wasting billions on the global warming con? make u.s. competitive 
president obama and other world leaders don't know how close they were to being seriously injured (or worse) standing next to psycho in sa.

the evidence continues to mount against lightweight @agschneiderman. it is time for jcope and moreland commissions to act. 



the ill conceived windfarm that @alexsalmond is pushing for aberdeen will lose $50 million a year. only a fool would build it or want it 
if graydon carter's very dumb bosses would fire him for his terrible circulation numbers at failing vanity fair his bad food restaurants die 
bird killing windfarm that i oppose in aberdeen got delayed by at least two years.@alexsalmond forced the failing developers to delay 

sources inside @agschneiderman’s office are saying that they are very concerned with the allegations against their lightweight boss. 
my complaint against @agschneiderman is a “case study” for jcope & moreland commissions on everything that is wrong with nys politics. 

can you believe that the corrupt and pathetic south africa police force has yet to arrest the sign language guy. such danger give 10 years 
what a sad thing that the memory of nelson mandela will be stained by the phoney sign language moron who is in every picture at funeral 


how amazing, the state health director who verified copies of obama’s “birth certificate” died in plane crash today. all others lived 
i hope you all are looking at the donald j. trump signature collection of ties, shirts & cufflinks @macys—great for christmas & holidays.

happy thanksgiving everyone, enjoy your day 
i truly believe that our country has the worst and dumbest negotiators of virtually any country in the world. 
can you believe that president karzai of afghanistan is holding out for more, more, more and refuses to sign deal. tell him to go to hell 
despite the fact that i have had great success with the words you're fired, i do not like firing people. but zero on obamacare mess no way 
why doesn't president obama simply apologize for telling a big fat lie, announce that obamacare was a mistake, and deal a really great plan 
us froze $8b in iranian assets during ’79 hostage crisis. now obama is giving it back to iran while christian pastor is jailed. don't do it 
happy thanksgiving to all even the haters and losers 
tell iran to let our christian pastor go and i mean right now. if they don't, there will be hell to pay. 
make sure to enjoy your time with your family during the holiday. it is a special time. love and appreciate your family. 
the $1b failed website is the tip of the iceberg on the obamacare. over 90 million estimated will lose their plans next year.

@mckay317 @trumptowerny i will check it out, thanks. 
mr. president, tell iran to immediately free the christian pastor, as a sign of good faith, & if they refuse break off talks big sanctions 
president obama said, over and over again, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, period this turned out to be a total lie 90 mill. 
look at the solution, not the problem. learn to focus on what will give results. 
set the example. you can motivate others as well as yourself by remembering that you are setting the example. 

how does obama rationalize giving iran $8b in sanction relief when a christian pastor is being tortured in an iranian prison?

president obama is finally getting hammered, even by his most loyal supporters and the press i guess they can only take so much 
new poll, wow 53% say president obama is not honest & trustworthy. what took them so long. go back and look at his house purchase in chicago 
don't worry, the united states will be great again 
just got home, watching the news, and every story is bad about the u.s. someday we will return to being great again, but we need leadership

why didn't obama, as part of the negotiation, free the christian pastor saeed abedini?http://bit.ly/18jfbar  
obama is going to take away over 90m americans’ healthcare plans but he is letting iran keep its nukes. just think about that. 
who would you rather have negotiating with iran president obama or toronto mayor ford? my money is on ford. 
realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort. you're in charge. everything starts with you. 
don't underestimate yourself or your possibilities keep your focus intact, and focus on the positives. 
after settling for a ridicilous 13 billion dollars, j.p.morgan's lawyer is critical of the amount of the fine why did they settle then dumb 
best book ever on dealmaking (or so they say) trump: the art of the deal. go get it, and others, washington you really can do better 
i know it has been many years since our country made great deals, but isn't it about time we start, right now. make america great again 
the reason great dealmakers do not openly celebrate a deal, especially one that is not complete, is that it shows weakness to the other side 
john kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with iran. great dealmakers do not celebrate deals,they just go on to the next one 
tom brady is a good friend of mine, a great player, a great guy and a total winner fantastic comeback win this is what our country needs 
tom brady has done a great job tonight amazing new england comeback. good game not over yet 
we had all the leverage in our nuclear negotiations with iran and our leaders foolishly decided to let them out of the trap. why? 
how much longer are we expected to put up with the world's most incompetent leader obamacare, iran, syria, bads deals. just never ends 
i will be on fox & friends tomorrow morning at 7. will be discussing basic stupidity and incompetence, of which our leaders have plenty 

i do not understand how so many of my jewish friends backed obama in the last election. he is a total disaster for israel and always will be 
how far has the united states gone down when we are reduced to accept the imbecilic deal just agreed to with iran. read the art of the deal 
what a rotten deal we made with iran. we get nothing (except laughter at our stupidity). they get everything, including delay and big cash 
they changed the name global warming to climate change because the concept of global warming just wasn't working 
the people that gave you global warming are the same people that gave you obamacare 
@mikehaas33: @realdonaldtrump mar a lago a spectacular property. here with wells fargo tonight and hoping you will come say hello i did 
snow and ice, freezing weather, in texas, arizona and oklahoma what the hell is going on with global warming? 
get smart on knockout assaults and crime we have to be slightly more vicious (and violent) than the assaulter and crime would end fast 
the scum that gets high on badly hurting old ladies and others through knockout assaults wouldn't feel that way with a gun at their head 
we are using the absolute wrong negotiating technique with respect to the iran nuclear talks. strengthen sanctions until great deal is made 
@whiteshaunwhite i dedicate my 750 tweet to most inspiring entrepreneurs of our time @realdonaldtrump, @billgates thx. 
young entrepreneurs – keep positive. don’t let the obamacare disaster stop your endeavors. there are great opportunities out there. 
@pattycake77777 happy birthday 
it’s friday. how many millions has the white house wasted on the obamacare website today? 
republicans have the right approach to obamacare – let it fail. free market solutions will be embraced by americans in 2016. 
such a nice article in the new york times about a wonderful developer, arthur zeckendorfhttp://nyti.ms/i4wcyx  
thomas jefferson wrote the senate filibuster rule. harry reid & obama killed it yesterday. rule was in effect for over 200 years. 
since the democrats decided to kill the filibuster, they now own it.republicans should keep the new rule when they're in the majority. 
hypocrite. watch senator obama defend democratic debate' of senate filibuster rules in 2005http://bit.ly/ikacor  
if jp morgan took their case through the courts for 15 years, nobody would be suing them—easy target. 
lightweight shakedown artist ag eric schneiderman was exposed in today’s new york post editorialhttp://bit.ly/18vq9ld  
for all those sick degenerates contemplating a knockout attack, please remember the late, great charles bronson no more crime 
weak newscasters are asking is there a racial component to knockout attacks? of course there is and weakness will only make it worse 
if you are lucky enough to catch a knockout assaulter before getting slugged, and you carry a gun, shoot the bastard (teach them a lesson) 
knockout assaults are the new rage by sick and depraved youth. we better start getting tough in this country and they want to take our guns 
emails prove wh knew obamacare website wouldn't work in october why didn't they delay the launch?http://fxn.ws/1c3qoic

@chucktodd @meetthepress @jack_welch chuck very fair, best wishes

last october on @meetthepress, @chucktodd attacked @jack_welch and i for saying obama cooked the job number. will he apologize? 

congratulations to @mariabartiromo on her big move to @foxbusiness. she is a total winner

@fransiscomlaza: @realdonaldtrump rich people are rich because they solve difficult problems ~ donald trump 
i will be going to trump national doral in miami early today to check on the construction of the hotel and the new blue monster. amazing 
how did the ncaa, which is weak and becoming irrelevant, extract such a big & reputation shattering settlement from penn state. others zero 
maybe some of the dead voters who helped get president obama elected can be brought back to life after signing up for obamacare. 
the wimps that run penn state should be forced to resign (and be sued) for the pathetic settlement they made and destruction of great legacy 

i wonder if the rutgers coach who had the audacity to yell at the player is a proponent of global warming? 
football coaches are no longer allowed to scream and yell at their players because it is discriminatory,racist and can be viewed as bullying 
i wonder what the late, great vince lombardi would say about the rutgers football player who says he is being bullied because coach yelled? 

@isaidknow: awesome rt again, more dead people voted in the last election than enrolled in obamacare. congratulations america ” thanks 
the real j.p.morgan is spinning in his grave at the ridiculous settlements the bank is making to settle disputes. a settler is a soft target 
13 billion, 4.5 billion these are the stupid settlements that j.p.morgan just made. why don't they fight? no wonder they keep getting sued.

@ojosborn: @realdonaldtrump i am one of them fools. the presidents heart in right place wrong, he knowingly lied bad intentions 

in a new poll a majority of people felt the president knowingly lied about health care pledge. who are the fools who don't think he lied? 
@countrygurl4747: @realdonaldtrump please run in 2016 we need a smart man like you to turn this once great nation back true 
@bretbaier you are doing really great keep it up (of which i have no doubt). 

the same people that built the obamacare website used, as the face of the website, someone who is not a us citizen. incompetent. 
can you believe it—the model who mysteriously disappeared from the obamacare website is not a us citizen—she’s from colombia. 
no matter how far down a path you go, if it's the wrong path, turn around and go back home before it is too late. 
obamacare is on life support it will soon be dead on arrival a bad concept that was imcompetently administered 
president obama is under pressure from democrats to undo his lie on obamacare. his problem is that such a move would end obamacare. 

@shrubshrub: i've said it before. i'll say it again. the turn down service at the @trumptoronto is the best in the world. thank you 
obamacare is one of the worst political disasters of all time 4,992,343 americans losing coverage, less than 50,ooo new signups. 
everyone should watch the documentary ‘windfall’ on @netflix. see an upstate ny town ruined by environmentalists & windfarms.

while i was in moscow i see that president obsma apologized for his lie, i mean statement, on obamacare how nice of him to be so forthright 
the republicans must be patient and smart obamacare could sweep them into office in far greater numbers than anyone ever thought possible 
@el_juino: @realdonaldtrump well i will predict that if u run for president you will win 
@joeyb134: i hope @realdonaldtrump will invite me to golf with him @trumpdoral when it is all complete. it looks like an awesome place 
if justice roberts had done the right thing and voted against obamacare, our country would be in a lot better shape right now total turmoil 
drew brees is having a great game a fantastic quarterback and really good guy 
if we could force russia, china and other competitors to use obamacare, we would be able to instantly destroy their great economic success 
@brahsumatra: @realdonaldtrump remember when you use to have real hair? (spelling) i still do dummy, it is all mine 
remember that i predicted a long time ago that president obama will attack iran because of his inability to negotiate properly not skilled 
i will be on fox & friends tomorrow morning at 7.ºº

i will be going to asheville, north carolina, tonight for the 95th birthday party of the great billy graham such a wonderful man 
if democrats do not start opposing obamacare, and fast, republicans will have a massive victory in 2014 far greater than any predictions 
a level will be reached where obamacare will be so out of control, expensive and unwieldy that the biggest supporters will abandon ship. 
prediction: the disaster known as obamacare will only get worse and republicans will gain far greater power than they have had in years 
put kathleen sebelius out of her misery and lovingly say, you're fired let her go home to her family and rest. bring in top flight people 
she is so sad and pathetic that i almost feel sorry for sec.sebelius. she has done great harm to many people and must be fired. incompetent 
just sit back and watch, obamacare is such a disaster it will fall like a house of broken cards. the website is the best part of this mess 
when obama tried to tweak his previous statement on obamacare he made it an even greater lie even the senate democrats are angry with him

the truth is that we could have much better healthcare in our country at a much more affordable price everyone in u.s. would benefit 
can you believe that the builder of the failed obamacare website was just given a new government contract how stupid is that clueless 


revisionist history. now obama claims he never told us that everyone could keep their healthcare plans. crazy 
hitting at home. democrat sen. joe donnelly’s son had his healthcare plan droppedhttp://yhoo.it/19z3vmk  





i would gain a whole new respect for president obama if he would say, look, we made a big mistake, sorry no more lies or deception.

@dannyzuker: .@realdonaldtrump i miss us. danny, i miss you tooooo 

@billmaher: with the cast from friday's real time and now i'm in springfield, mass for standup tonight and bill, you totally bombed bad 
how come snowden and obamacare have access to all records and information but don't have even the smallest tidbits on president obama? 
obamacare is a disaster and snowden is a spy who should be executed but if it and he could reveal obama's records,i might become a major fan 
“you're never a loser until you quit trying.” mike ditka 
china just called. they want to lend obama another $1b for the obamacare web site. 
via @wsj: “the obamacare awakening: americans are losing their coverage by political design.”http://on.wsj.com/1astyst  
if obama was willing to lie about obamacare then what else has he lied to us about… 
four brave americans died in benghazi. administration is still covering up the truth. we deserve to know the full truth. 


it is now a fact that president obama lied in order to get obamacare passed that is fraud and the legislation should be recinded interesting 
@haay_ramiiie: @realdonaldtrump has the best twitter 

i hear @billmaher really bombed in springfield people were leaving show way early stupid guy 
won’t be a buyer’s market for long. if you can, purchase a home but remember, i told you this three years ago. 
congrats @nbcinvestigates on revealing that obama knew millions of americans would lose their healthcare planshttp://nbcnews.to/19otfrr  
fact – all the countries complaining about us spying on them spy on us. they just don't get caught stupid 

.@alexsalmond of scotland may be the dumbest leader of the free world. i can’t imagine that anyone wants him in office. 
.@alexsalmond –the man who let terrorist (pan am flight 103) al megrahi go, lost another battle over ugly wind turbines in blackdog. 
.@alexsalmond suffered a huge defeat by the people of blackdog. communities all over scotland are fighting this loser. 
when will @alexsalmond realize that he's destroying scotland the most beautiful countryside in the world w/ his stupid wind turbines? 
great victory for people of blackdog, scotland. they defeated substation, stopping inefficient & ugly wind turbines.@alexsalmond 

@megrunder: .@realdonaldtrump is there any subject you aren’t an expert on? no, not many 
maybe if obama knew too much about the spying it would be worse than knowing nothing but either way it is just another disaster 
i just don't know why some of these nfl teams with lousy quarterbacks don't give tim tebow a chance what do they have to lose? 
there are so many blatant lies coming out of the administration healthcare, spying, nsa, irs, brutally killed americans will it ever end? 
does anybody really think that president obama didn't know about our spying on the leaders of allies around the world not possible 
@abird95: i absolutely love @realdonaldtrump he is my favorite person ever and inspires me to do so much. thanks r 
like your current health care plan? too bad, you’re going to lose it under obamacare. hope, change & a 300% increase in your premium. 

contractors can blame obama admin all day for their $600m failure but both parties are at fault pay taxpayers back. 
sebelius didn't test $635m (probably $1b) obamacare website until “a couple of days leading up to the launch.”http://bit.ly/hmctkv

isn't it amazing that the u.s. and nsa can listen to the highly protected phone conversations of world leaders but can't get o's records 
at this point the legacy of the obama administration will be, sadly, that of the gang that couldn't shoot straight what a pathetic mess 
with the $635 million dollar website fiasco, getting caught tapping phones of world leaders and so much more, u.s. is looking really stupid

@rydev22 great 
@strommer07 yes and thanks. 
@danamira apology accepted. 
if the saudis are so concerned about syria then they should go in themselves. stop telling us to do their dirty work. 
i’ll soon be leaving for washington where @amspec will give me the t. boone pickens entrepreneur award. very exciting 
where’s the accountability for the $635m website fiasco in the obama administration? heads should roll and officials should be fired 

why doesn't president obama call upon the nsa to fix the badly broken website then they could spy on all of the many cheaters & arrest them 
honestly, whether you're for or against obamacare, the 635 million dollar website fiasco is bad for the u.s. it makes us look totally inept 
@donjuanriley1: getting a picture of donald trump and putting it on a shirt tomorrow cause hes a true american hero :) wow, so nice 
breaking news the washington redskins have just announced that they will be removing the name washington from their name

the rollout of obamacare is a total disaster and an embarrassment to our country. the world is watching and laughing.$635,000,000 website 
@nymag in every interview new york magazine has done for years they ask the same question what do you think of donald trump? beggars 
@nymag can you imagine a top editor at new york magazine calling for my death if they were responsible, he would be fired totally biased. 
@nymag wow, numbers are really looking bad at new york magazine. while very boring, it is also very biased. too bad, was once great

@tormeypaul: @realdonaldtrump @danamira @nymag does anyone actually still subscribe? not many 
just like its website, obamacare is a disaster.maybe all those who are fighting it are wasting their time it will fail on its own 
secy. sebelius, who was responsible for the horrendous obamacare rollout, should resign or be fired.refuses to go before congress to explain 
@michaelledeitri: and this is why r kids are bullies, horrible examples set by adults. no excuses @nymag fire him @foxnews @cbsnews

@val_wonders: @realdonaldtrump @danamira @nymag does anyone read @nymag anymore. i'm sure it'll be sold for a dollar just like newsweek. 
@silvermarie2001: @realdonaldtrump whats wrong with canadians? nothing except they are too smart for u.s. leaders to deal with 
i hope everyone that read @danamira's reprehensible statement will cancel their subscription to @nymag in protest. let me know. 

no wonder @nymag is doing so poorly, with an idiot sr. editor like @danamira, it will only get worse 
@danamira @nymag a terrible statement like that shows how desperate you and your magazine are. you should be ashamed. 
canadians kicked out the firm that the u.s. paid all that money to for the failed website. how stupid are our leaders ? this is a scandal 
wow, china's growth accelerated 7.8% in third quarter. if the u.s. had half that number we would be the talk of the world need leadership 
no surprise saudis turned down spot on un security council. they don’t want responsibility. just have us do their heavy lifting. 
i love watching the dishonest writers @nymag suffer the magazine’s failure. 

our country is being run by total amateurs. let’s just call it “amateur hour.” 
can you imagine a canadian company developing our website? terrible way to put americans back to work.

obamacare website fiasco was a single bid to a canadian company terrible 
i build beautiful websites with very smart and imaginative people for almost nothing. our government spent almost $535, 000, 000 for nothing 
the contract to build the obamacare website was given to a canadian company for $55, 744, 081. it then bloated to $292, 071,067 incompetence

@jimbou1234: @realdonaldtrump great job on piers morgan thank you. 
@piersmorgan i urge every politician in washington to tune into cnn and listen to @realdonaldtrump 's advice on how to do a deal. 
@piersmorgan watch cnn tonight as piers and i discuss obama, shutdown, leadership and many other topics of interest 9 pm 10 minutes 

i’ll be doing @piersmorgan show tonight on cnn at 9 pm. will be very interesting. (i hope ) 

obama has called @gop terrorists during this showdown. it’s a shame he really doesn’t think it because then he would meet all @gop demands. 

the fact that we are here today to debate raising america’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. sen. obama, 3/16/06 
obama’s job approval is at 37%, a record low. @gop & @speakerboehner have the leverage & momentum. delay obamacare for all americans 
obama can open the mall for illegals to protest our country yet he continues to barricade wwii memorial. that’s an absolute disgrace. 

@amberlay2013 thank you. 
@shadowbat thank you. 
@cory_wise @realdonaldtrump thank you for stepping up to help our fallen service heroes thank you.

re florida power & light—most important is safety but they have to also cater to aesthetics & not ruin the beauty of florida. 
i pay millions of $’s a year to florida power & light & they can’t give us what we want. maybe a major class action suit against them?

if the u.s. government doesn't give the money necessary for the burials of our military personnel, i will.the u.s. under obama's leadership 
it is outrageous and disgusting that families of u.s. military personnel killed in action will not be given money for burials. sad 

@kristensharpe30: @realdonaldtrump @nhoiegee love donald trump and the support he gives to positive women today : ) 
@motleyhoney: @realdonaldtrump i say go for it, solid business leadership for a change. congrats on the new development in vancouver thanks 
@nhoiegee: @realdonaldtrump am i gonna see u in russia this november?? are u goin to attend the event? miss universe on nov 9th, yes 
@genallkasmikha i notice, thanks genall 
with president obama it's all talk and no action. our country is in desperate need of smart and decisive leadership before it is too late 
@joseconesa01: @realdonaldtrump it is time for real change. donal j. trump 2016. obama, you're fired thanks for the nice words 
i'm just so tired of listening to the same old rhetoric and words, day after day, from our president. it's time to stop talking work 
florida power & light has disgusting rotting utility poles outside doral in miami. they should put in new ones or will be sued. 
in my opinion, one of the worst utility companies in the country is florida power and light. 

did you ever think our country would become an economic basket case? so much for hope & change. 

had a great time on @gretawire’s inaugural 7pm show. congrats to greta on the new spot 
.@gop has leverage. must stay united & on message. 
if you are steadfast in your efforts and self respect, critics will be harmless. keep your focus 
expect the best from people. they will rise to the challenge and it's important to inspire confidence. 
@kimfeather177 thanks. 
@jon_dennis82 @redskins true. 
@myangel82 @bobbymayojr thanks. 
@jeffanie thank you. 
president obama wants to change the name of the white house because it is highly discriminating and not at all politically correct 
president should not be telling the washington redskins to change their name our country has far bigger problems focus on them,not nonsense 

@mimi_la_reina: @fogslifting @realdonaldtrump @redskins that will never fly they'd have to do the same for the chiefs, braves, indians ect 
my sense is that people are far angrier at the president than they are at congress re the shutdown—an interesting turn 
“do not allow fear to settle into place in any part of your life. it is a defeating attitude & a negative emotion think like a champion 
with the debt limit approaching, @gop has even more leverage. if they stay united and on message they can win. 
“we build too many walls and not enough bridges.” isaac newton 
83% of the government is still running during the shutdown while 41% of nondefense federal workers are furloughed. room for cuts. 
obama is tougher on wwii vets wanting to visit a dc memorial than iran. he needs to show respect to our vets and not play games. 
government is shut down yet obama is now harassing the privately owned @redskins to change its name.he needs to focus on his job 
standing strong for his people, @govwalker is ignoring the feds and keeping all wisconsin parks open. great 

@thegine3000: @realdonaldtrump we need someone with some business sense in the white house. this administration doesn't have a clue. 
@bobbymayojr: @realdonaldtrump thank you mr. trump for speaking up just now please don't stop 
@genemcvay: @realdonaldtrump the donald says the republicans absolutely can win if they will stand firm. @speakerboehner 
@wrnsr: @realdonaldtrump negotiations are non existant, obama needs to be sent a copy of the art of the deal (maybe autographed) 
@jacadere: @foxandfriends @realdonaldtrump mr.trump is right again. the republicans need to stick together and let the dems be blamed. 
the obama administration has a very important duty to provide a budget and then negotiate our country is a laughingstock 
@mfbirk: @genemcvay @realdonaldtrump @speakerboehner stand firm and america will support the gop

obama and the democrats have no respect for wwii vets trying to get into the memorial. 
many red state democrats sticking with obama on deficit spending on the obamacare monstrosity will be defeated in 2014.

when it comes to iran's nuclear weapons program, here's my advice: distrust, dismantle and verify. @israelipm @netanyahu

business is an art in itself, and powerful negotiation skills are one of the techniques necessary to facilitate success.

no one wants the government to shut down, but if obamacare is fully implemented then our country will eventually shutdown anyway

the democrats in congress don’t want obamacare for themselves or big businesses. so why are they forcing it on the american people?

@clydejayvy: @realdonaldtrump you'd be a great professor. my uncle was a professor at m.i.t. 
@klyushina_eng: @realdonaldtrump when do you plan to come to moscow? at the beginning of november? looking forward for your coming nov. 9 
@maxiculture: @realdonaldtrump your thoughts are simple, straight, precise, timely and timeless. thank you 
@fathersiisi: @realdonaldtrump 's tweets about negotiations should be treated as trusted gem's cause he knows what he's talking about 
@spencer67: @realdonaldtrump for once, i completely agree with you business wise, you're brilliant. i just don't support your politics ok 
@seankanderson: @realdonaldtrump i have so much respect for you that i don't care that you blatantly criticize the president i support 
move slowly, carefully and then strike like the fastest animal on the planet 
@hoppmar: @realdonaldtrump i saw his brother in kenya interviewed, he may be wiser, actually. i'm so surprised his brother lives in kenya 
president obama must remember that the worst thing you can do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. be cool, move slowly and think iran 
president obama seems so fawning and desperate to make a deal with iran that lots of bad results can occur. be cool and be careful

as a stockholder in apple, they should get on with a larger screen iphone as a supplement—immediately. 
my comments on a larger screen iphone were in addition to existing unit, not a replacement. screen should be 10% larger than samsung. 
@geomac24 amazing engineering accomplishment that does not make economic sense. 
@anthonydefrenza: @realdonaldtrump apple is hard of hearing. so true 

lightweight schneiderman's suit was filed on a saturday (unheard of) against a school with a 98% approval rating right after obama meeting. 
lightweight a.g. eric schneiderman meets with president obama (who he told me sucks as a president), and quickly files a suit against me 
@iphoneteam better get a large screen iphone, and fast, or risk losing even more business. samsung cannot believe you have not acted dumb 
@keilanik1: @realdonaldtrump apple meant for their phones to go to people who have super sight & abnormally tiny fingers for texting 
i cannot believe that apple didn't come out with a larger screen iphone. samsung is stealing their business. steve jobs is spinning in grave

@casey1137: @realdonaldtrump can you prove it? yes 
lightweight a.g. eric schneiderman is perhaps the most incompetent and least respected a.g. in the u.s. he is a total joke 
why is lightweight a.g. eric schneiderman allowed to ask for campaign contributions from my people during settlement negotiations? 
lightweight a.g. eric schneiderman sued school with a 98% approval rating while billions in corruption goes unpunished. a total crook? 

just returned from trump doral in miami. massive construction job. when completed will be the best resort in u.s. blue monster is amazing

only 15 days until obamacare is implemented. congress must waive the monstrosity for regular americans. why should they be punished? 

bashar assad is stronger today than he was before obama threatened military action. obama really bungled this.

no games house @gop must defund obamacare if they don’t, then they own it 
now assad is demanding that obama stop supporting the rebels before he turns over his chemical weapons. what a mess 
china, russia and iran are laughing at us. we have weak leaders who are threatening our national security. dangerous times. 


at least @thetinabeast is consistent. she takes over a magazine and it ends up in the gutter. 
@thetinabeast is claiming that she decided to leave the @thedailybeast. sure, just like every other magazine that fired her. 
tina brown could finally be over. @thedailybeast is a total failure. she just got fired, great

@accountsrs @realdonaldtrump thank you for saving new york from another spitzer era. we got lucky 
obama must now start focusing on our country, jobs, healthcare and all of our many problems. forget syria and make america great again 
putin is having such a good time. our president is making him look like the genius of all geniuses. do not fear,we are a nation of potential 
i said that eliot spitzer was going to lose when he was way up in the polls. i fought him when others retreated out of fear. never give up 
spitzer and weiner lost, lightweight eric schneiderman will be next he will be challenged in the primary. he has done a really poor job 
@redellis1: @realdonaldtrump he must go... people like him r destroying our country and our principals re lightweight a.g. schneiderman

@johndoe5210: @realdonaldtrump . i worked for another self made man, elon musk. i have the greatest respect for both of you. thank you 
weiner is gone, spitzer is gone next will be lightweight a.g. eric schneiderman. is he a crook? wait and see, worse than spitzer or weiner 
assad hit the jackpot 
back to work for the president to try and keep some dignity for the office and himself. the so called rebels must be thoroughly confused 
the only reason obama gave a speech last night was because it was on the schedule putin is laughing and the reviews have been really bad 

@airmanfirst: @realdonaldtrump think weiner will move to a state that doesn't know him? he should move, better for him to make a new start 
lightweight attorney general eric schneiderman will be next to lose. he goes after a school with a 98% approval rating,leaves biggies alone 
lightweight a.g. eric schneiderman asked us for political contributions during his investigation of us,then sued for $40 million.dopey guy

@brock2120: @realdonaldtrump i remember when schneiderman was 2nd in command to patterson on the d side. can you believe those two? 
thank you to all of my twitter followers for helping to defeat weiner and spitzer. remember, in the beginning they said it couldn't be done 
i fought hard against spitzer and weiner, and both lost. for a while, when spitzer was way up, it seemed that i was a lone voice good power 
@tvreporter: @realdonaldtrump what will you miss most about wiener? absolutely nothing 
@mikethescrew: @realdonaldtrump give credit where it is due. nyc voters chose correctly. 
wow, eliot spitzer has lost great news for new york city 
bottom line, i don't think president changed people's minds must hope for a lifeline from putin, a very dangerous lifeline at that 
we will have to see what russia's next move will be. they may have given him an out of an embarrassing situation or drove into deeper mess 
he is working hard and for that he must be given credit 

doesn't want to remove assad worries what comes next. 
making his case in a nice and articulate manner. 
does he look sharp, smart and presidential his hands keep hitting the podium, making a loud and distracting noise microphone too sensitive. 
here we go

red line statement was a disaster for president obama. 
this new russian strategy guarantees victory for the syrian government and makes obama and u.s. look hopelessly bad. president in trouble

iraq has granted iran full air rights to fly over and arm syria. what did america accomplish with the iraq war? and now syria? 
this week will mark the 1 year anniversary of the attack in benghazi that left 4 americans dead. no answers 
now obama has set red line 2 with demand that assad hands over syria’s chemical weapons or it will face an attack. 
congratulations to @serenawilliams on her superb @usopen win. she is terrific 




don't attack syria an attack that will bring nothing but trouble for the u.s. focus on making our country strong and great again 
why are we fighting for the rebels that hate us only to save face for obama

@hoxma: @realdonaldtrump my djt collection men's wallet from @macy's lasted me many years. loved that wallet 
@arianag_lover26: @realdonaldtrump @macy damn right just bought one lookin fresh great 
@vnessa09: do you wear your brand from @macy's? rt @realdonaldtrump: yes 
@joeperella3: @realdonaldtrump @macy i got a suit and 3 ties from you great joe

@dexterpugh great looking couple good to have him back 

my shirts, ties and suits are selling great @macy's because they are the best and most stylish at a really reasonable price thanks 



@midgespeaks i want him to do a great job but he can't. 
@anitaozz2: @toure @realdonaldtrump trump will do or say anything. but toure (why only one name?) is just a very dumb racist bad ratings 
president obama, do not attack syria. there is no upside and tremendous downside. save your powder for another (and more important) day 
isn't it intetesting that anybody who attacks president obama is considered a racist by the real racists out there 
@unabashedprog: @realdonaldtrump @thegroveguru can you imagine serious people comparing modern warfare to a football game? actually yes 
@rlsteetle: @realdonaldtrump i'm addicted to your books. are you writing another any time soon? at some point, there is so much to write 

speaking of our very stupid war with iraq, it is totally disintegrating and iran (with russia) will walk in and take it over (lots of oil) 
@lucindamac thank you, but we are dealing with many very stupid people 
@thegroveguru: @realdonaldtrump could you imagine bill belichek broadcasting to tom coughlin exactly when and where he was going to blitz? 
@ericjgiroux: @realdonaldtrump you need to make a run time will tell 
@robertr369: @realdonaldtrump if only japan had the same courtesy dec 1941 they should have told us they were coming like us with syria 
i'm a republican but not a fan of the last george bush he also was a lousy president (iraq etc.). in fact, he was so bad he gave us obama 
former president jimmy carter is so happy that he is no longer considered the worst president in the history of the united states 
syria has been given so much time that much of the things we were going to bomb have been moved into civilian areas a polititian's war. 
just watching nbc news where our potential attack is being detailed the exact ships, the stealth bombers, the destinations so ridiculous 
@bretbaier: thx rt @jedediahbila well done, @bretbaier thurs cable news ratings: fox's bret baier beats cnn, msnbc, hln combined. 

if syria was forced to use obamacare they would self destruct without a shot being fired. obama should sell them that idea 
when we have big disasters, no one comes to our aid or even suggests helping but we are always expected to come to the aid of others 
@garrygreiner: @realdonaldtrump we should send obama and congress to syria

“do you want to know who you are? don't ask. act action will delineate and define you.” thomas jefferson 
obama is not a leader, he's just a campaigner 
many of the syrian rebels are radical jihadi islamists who are murdering christians. why would we ever fight with them? 

no surprise. woman being cited by kerry & mccain on syrian rebels is a paid consultant of the rebelshttp://bit.ly/19pezr7  
the historic $250m renovations at @trumpdoral are moving on pace. once complete, @trumpdoral will be south florida’s premiere resort. 
“remember the golden rule of negotiating: ‘he who has the gold makes the rules.’” – midas touch 
@robyncook7: it's sad that @realdonaldtrump knows more about politics than our politicians 
i am not angry at russia (or china) because their leaders are far smarter than ours. we need real leadership, and fast,before it is too late 
i wonder how much our leaders have promised, or given, russia in order for them to behave and not make the u.s. look even worse? 
really bad news just announced concerning jobs. far fewer jobs created in august than anticipated. interest rates, therefore, to remain low. 
we don't have the leadership, including the generals (who just said the element of surprise does not matter) to attack anyone cool it. 
did you ever see a situation so ridiculous as our president explaining what, when and where to congress about a syrian attack. far too late 
@vindictivraider: @realdonaldtrump well quit yapping about and run for office. i like your ideas. do it 
@reallltalk: @realdonaldtrump trump for president thanks. 
@autumnallday: @realdonaldtrump i wish you'd run for office. the country needs more minds like yours. thank you. 
@khalidnasser: @realdonaldtrump in this case, what would you do if you were the president? i'd rebuild the u.s. and make it great again 

the terrorists in syria are calling themselves rebels and getting away with it because our leaders are so completely stupid 
@jessegunplayjay: @realdonaldtrump you're a pussy shut up and stop crying @jayleno show is funny no, jay is dumb as a rock gets outplayed 
we should not attack syria but if they make the stupid move to do so, the arab league,whose members are laughing at us, should pay 
“if you plan for the worst – if you can live with the worst – the good will always take care of itself.” – the art of the deal 
... while a 300ft turbine in ardrossan, north ayrshire, erupted in flames the previous month during gales of 165 mphhttp://dailym.ai/18wci7h  

russia is sending a fleet of ships to the mediterranean. obama’s war in syria has the potential to widen into a worldwide conflict. 

all former bush administration officials should have zero standing on syria. iraq was a waste of blood & treasure. 



it will be interesting to see what happens to eliot spitzer if he loses the election for comptroller to very capable @scottmstringer. 
i have just lost my beautiful & elegant long time exec. assistant norma foerderer. she passed away yesterday – a truly magnificent woman. 
again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack syria if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the u.s. gets nothing 
@gregfrech: @realdonaldtrump have you seen the video of the rebel commander cutting out and eating the syrian soldiers heart & liver 
while everyone is waiting and prepared for us to attack syria, maybe we should knock the hell out of iran and their nuclear capabilities? 
if you look at the horrible picture on the front page of the ny times of the rebels executing prisoners, you would say forget the rebels 
tell congress to straighten out the many problems of our country before trying to be the policemen to the world. make america great again 
@whoopsydoodle: @realdonaldtrump god your the best mr. trump i like you tooooo 
@bchipper83: @realdonaldtrump haha i love how you just tell like it is you aren't who you are by not doing just that thank you 
the only reason president obama wants to attack syria is to save face over his very dumb red line statement. do not attack syria,fix u.s.a. 
president obama put himself in a very bad position when he talked about syria crossing the red line. amazingly, now he denies he said that 
@bchipper83: @realdonaldtrump haha i love how you just tell like it is you aren't who you are by not doing just that 
@walterdisneyusa: @realdonaldtrump you would make such a good president thank you 
@livin_in_80s: @realdonaldtrump hell yeah dammit i love the frankness and brutal honesty of @realdonaldtrump it is the only way

@thecarlossegura: @realdonaldtrump do u like lettermans show? yes, much smarter than leno. 
@fsusteve: @realdonaldtrump why do you think you're so polarizing? because i like to be it often times brings out the truth 
is anthony weiner a jerk or what 
jay leno and his people are constantly calling me to go on his show. my answer is always no because his show sucks. they love my ratings 
@pdgreenwood: i wish i could go on jay's show so badly real quote from @realdonaldtrump real quote is i wish they would stop calling 
@twojacksdetail send it to me in new york, doug thanks. 
@reaperoftruth: @realdonaldtrump u mad because @jayleno doesn't want u on his show? he begs me to go on his show done it many times loser 
@whiskeyscowgirl: @realdonaldtrump just turned off jay i can't watch him anymore, running out with the phony high fives he's lost it 
@jp_worldwide: @realdonaldtrump you need to go on @howardstern to bash jay leno. howard hates him too howard is right on leno jay is over 
@mariadavidson10: @realdonaldtrump you have more followers than they (@billmaher @jayleno) do. so true, and am hopefully much smarter 
“appreciate your property, and your property will appreciate for you.” – think like a billionaire 
i hear this moron @billmaher said nasty things about me (hair etc—boring) on the terminated @jayleno show. stupid guy/bad ratings 
i’ve always defended @jayleno but he never defends me. he's not a loyal person & i now understand why everybody dumped him. jay sucks 
“to keep momentum, keep challenging yourself.” – think big 

@tylerkrist734 thanks. 
@dhtherex thanks. 
happy new year to all of my jewish friends and supporters. shana tova. hopefully it will be a great year 
.@gop must stay focused on defunding obamacare and the impending budget battle. don’t let syria rule the agenda. 
.@serenawilliams had a flawless @usopen quarterfinal win last night. she’s a great player and a wonderful person. 
many syrian ‘rebels’ are radical jihadis. not our friends & supporting them doesn't serve our national interest. stay out of syria 

congratulations to @piersmorgan on winning @britishgq tv personality of the year. piers deserves his success 
@ladyjelenaxoxo thanks. 
@golflessondubai soon. 
@shawshank5 @realdonaldtrump to be a champ. you have to believe in yourself when nobody else will true 
@michael_dorris: @realdonaldtrump: @tannermarkboots: @realdonaldtrump never tell your enemy when where and how you are going to hit them 
@ukn96: @realdonaldtrump if two of your competitors were at war, would you let them destroy each other? or would you back one? 
@andrewessex1: @realdonaldtrump @tannermarkboots just finished 'art of the deal', brilliant insight into your mind, thanks 
@atkins4: @realdonaldtrump you realize that is what iran wants, dont you? you beat iran in a much different fashion not through syria 
for all of those fools that want to attack syria, the u.s.has lost the vital element of surprise so stupid could be a disaster 
what i am saying is stay out of syria. 
the great generals macarthur and patton, real leaders and fighters, are spinning in their graves as we give syria info & time to prepare. 
@bigsexybdavis: @realdonaldtrump mr trump would attack syria or no? no, lets make our country great again as they fight their war 
@battoulshamsi: @realdonaldtrump i just love ur way of thinking and analyzing things, 2 the point. thanks. 
@davidagoodman: @realdonaldtrump:how can general dempsey tell obama delaying syria bombardment will have no consequences? he's no patton 
@nattiebright: @realdonaldtrump if u r so disappointed at obama why don't u run for president in 2016 watch 
@jvmesb: @realdonaldtrump is the kind of president we need true 
@twittahmachine0: @realdonaldtrump mr trump for president thank you 


“representing your own brand yourself is the best way to go. if you can’t sell it, who will?” – midas touch 

@perkins_holly great 
@bigpoppa181 thanks. 
how can general martin dempsey tell obama that delaying the syria bombardment will have no consequences? he is no patton or macarthur. 
“a big key to winning is knowing where the other side is coming from.” – think like a champion 

china, opec and russia laugh at us. but now thanks to obama so does syria. very sad 


@thobane63: @realdonaldtrump why the hell are you always criticising obama because he is doing a terrible, in fact embarrassing, job 
president obama's arab spring is not looking so good right now 
@trill_blowa: if the government just listened to @realdonaldtrump this country would be so much better 
@devante4liberty: @realdonaldtrump but if we had a republican president you would say the exact opposite right? wrong 
think of it, the arab league doesn't want to get involved with syria but they want us to do their dirty work. how stupid 
if the u.s. attacks syria and hits the wrong targets, killing civilians, there will be worldwide hell to pay. stay away and fix broken u.s. 
our country is looking very bad right now 
@desorourke84: @realdonaldtrump trump tower here in chicago is such an impressive building and architecturally really fits in with the area 
@alto67: @realdonaldtrump your thoughts on bill de blasio for mayor... i predicted two years ago that he would win 
@flljeff: @realdonaldtrump you always keep it real mr. trump...the truth hurts sometimes and america needs you to run in 2016 
@tarekr: @realdonaldtrump if you ever become president of the us, what would be your first step? get rid of obamacare 
@rizz_lizz: @realdonaldtrump i am surprised weiner is so delusional to think that he still has a shot should seek help. 
@pantysoaker420: @realdonaldtrump @schulesix3 @jamesfrancotv james franco is prettier than donald trump but i get better ratings 
@charliemassie: i hope @realdonaldtrump runs for president. for obvious reasons. 
@kyleraccio: @realdonaldtrump donald have you noticed how so many people want you to run? amazing. i think you will win handily. thanks 
@_itstracy: @realdonaldtrump run for prime minster in the uk and first minister in scotland....we could use your help cute

@jamieemingg: @realdonaldtrump i love you djt sr for president 2016 thanks 

@arseniohall after arsenio won celebrity apprentice he told me, in tears, that i would be his first guest if he got a show. no interest 
@lucyinthesky61: @realdonaldtrump @53andlex agree completely mr. trump for president thanks 
@ewudziyamoah: @realdonaldtrump glad to find you thank you for your philanthropic work, thank you 
eliot spitzer has failed at everything he has ever done, and now he wants to be comptroller. thrown out of politics and off of tv, crazy 
each time i see one of anthony weiner's television ads for mayor i ask, what the hell is he doing just wasting money & time go get a job 

@53andlex: @realdonaldtrump, please run for potus 2016. america desperately needs a true leader with common sense thank you. 
@schulesix3: roast of @jamesfrancotv will be the best one since @realdonaldtrump ok, as long as mine remains number one 
@mikethoms85: @realdonaldtrump with all due respect, bush did exactly the same thing in iraq. you will seldom see me defending bush. 

@tkeller316 thanks 
in war, the elememt of surprise is sooooo important.what the hell is obama doing. 
@libertybellskp: @realdonaldtrump that's the plan. have you ever seen such a clueless leader in all your life? i am stunned daily. 
@bdeal10: @realdonaldtrump you should be our next president. this country would be in much better shape if you would have run in 2012 true 
@swagdaddyyol0: why isn't @realdonaldtrump president instead of obama ?? that is truly a good question 
we have given syria so much time and information there has never been such an instance in wartime history. syria is now fully prepared 
why isn't the arab league paying for everything and sending troops? they want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves 
the arab league stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on syria, but they want us to attack.are our leaders insane or just stupid 

@mguarino64: @realdonaldtrump how would you treat the syria situation if president ? i'd let them all fight with each other focus on us 
@imanthonyholmes: i've always looked up to @realdonaldtrump. business and politics he's the man thank you 
@rick_huebner: @realdonaldtrump my son joey survived leukemia. he is is now 13. thank you make a wish and nccf for everything they did. 
it is truly amateur hour at the white house and this is why we should not be doing the war thing right now 
@akmackey so true 
@illuminati6sep: @realdonaldtrump , you should be president . save america thank you 
president obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly (in more ways than money) attack on syria 
@brandiharmon good luck. 
@timi_fel: @realdonaldtrump you always have something negative to say about obama ,dont you? yes 
@bbpack you have real talent 
@ethan738: @realdonaldtrump just bought some beautiful trump cuff links great 
@thegrumpyhusky happy birthday. 
@danshrigley thank you. 
@jonathanagin: @realdonaldtrump wondering if u know or care that tomorrow begins childhood cancer awareness month. 
@irazaalishah: @realdonaldtrump donald you are anti obama no matter what obama does, you will take the opposite view. wrong all on merit 
@dickquinn: @realdonaldtrump obviously amateur hour at the wh. obama was unqualified when he ran and remains so. 
@danconiapm: @realdonaldtrump he's no churchill. he might not even be jimmy carter 
@politixchick: just from reading his tweets, it seems like @realdonaldtrump could run our country much better than our president right now. 
did anyone notice that obama failed to get a coalition of other countries to go along with us. he couldn't even get britain no leadership. 
@aveyahdoeswatch thank you. 
@jayneg53: @realdonaldtrump can't say obama doesn't know how to throw a polite war general patton would not be happy right now 
@jessenicholas13: @realdonaldtrump i'm scared for my future. you should be 
be prepared, there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into world war iii. 
china is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess. they will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortune & laugh at us 
obama now just wants to save face, russia is now telling him don't do it . he waited too long and the other side is much better prepared. 
who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes. call it the plenty of notice war 

syria has prepared for an attack based on all of our talk they have moved targeted ammunition and supplies to new locations.amazing 
for the first time in the history of military operations a country has broadcast what, when and where they will be doing in a future attack 
the president must get congressional approval before attacking syria big mistake if he does not 

@joe1spro: @realdonaldtrump the president of syria is killing people inhumanly but the so called rebels may be just as bad (or worse) 
@kingsfansouth: @realdonaldtrump i usually agree with you, not tonight. stop criticizing the president. i will when he makes good decisions 
@jenconservative: @rkdrake @realdonaldtrump i would be totally surprised if the us even has any money to spend on syria we don't 
@jaymiller283: @realdonaldtrump @jenconservative we need a strong minded potus in office before we enter into another war. 
@kswizzle43: @realdonaldtrump what would you do give a solution vs being so critical?. . i would make america great again 
@leebandoni: @realdonaldtrump for once the uk has seen sense and not been dragged into this. they were, for once, very smart 
@onemikex: @realdonaldtrump he's to soft of a president incompetent would be a better word 
@jenconservative: @realdonaldtrump not to mention we probably don't have the money to spend on another long war so true 
how bad has our leader made us look on syria. stay out of syria, we don't have the leadership to win wars or even strategize. 
if obama attacks syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed, he and the u.s. will look very bad 
is everyone seeing how incompetently our country is being run by watching the mess with syria? our leaders don't know what they are doing 
the ratings of the cycle on msnbc, a sad and pathetic show, are way down. if they fired racist moron @toure, a truly stupid guy, they live 
@dhfr64 happy birthday deborah.

@gfeorg: @realdonaldtrump a talk show is an amazing idea so many would love to see you do it...your insight on a daily basis? what a gift 
pervert weiner is dead in his race for mayor of nyc but wow, eliot spitzer has dropped way down in recent poll for comptroller. sleaze 
@reuschal: @realdonaldtrump how do you know those kids will never work? i know 
so, a woman in chicago, who never had a job, has 9 kids with 7 different men (she is one of many). these kids will never work. trouble 
@hrt05hsv: @realdonaldtrump @realdbp you could do it in your sleep and still make more sense than these other morons. thanks. 
@ronhromadka: @realdonaldtrump talk shows are stale but a daily look at the inside wheeling and dealing of the trump org. exciting 
@joseczrs: of course @realdonaldtrump would be one of the few to publicly support miley cyrus' racist behavior. oh, & now she's a racist? 
@wcmartzofficial so true 
@realdbp: @realdonaldtrump a talk show is a great idea. please make the time sir. the country needs you now more than ever. 
@realdbp: @realdonaldtrump a talk show would be the perfect arena for you mr. trump. ratings would soar through the roof but no time 
@cbs397: @realdonaldtrump you should have your own talk show. networks and many have asked, but i don't have the time. thanks 
@gocubbies22: @realdonaldtrump bought a poster frame from my wal mart store today, and the sample picture was trump tower in chicago. great 
@zachheatherly: could be argued that @realdonaldtrump may or may not be a horrible person, but his twitter is the best thank you donald. 
@beliefheals interesting and thanks 
@fartlesburg: @realdonaldtrump do you ever get sad? i don't have the time 
@benfromdallas thanks ben. 
@agnesphagnes i agree, thanks. 
i hope everyone read the brilliant article in american spectator about leightweight a.g. eric schneiderman. he should be run out of office 
in that @timewarner has @hbo with really dumb racist bryant gumbel(and i mean dumb), and no cbs (which fired bryant), i am switching bldgs.

@danscavino @erictrump @erictrumpfdn @stjude thanks dan. 
@marlenawells true. 
@jonareeves6127 thanks. 

what will we get for bombing syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict? obama needs congressional approval. 
congress must protect our borders first. amnesty should be done only if the border is secure and illegal immigration has stopped.

@jungledad thanks 

if christian bale turned down $50m to return as batman he should have his head examined. what was he thinking? 
the yankees are sure lucky george steinbrenner is not around. a lot of people would be losing their jobs. 

wow, @cnbc ratings are really low, worst in many years. i guess i'll have to start doing my tuesday morning interviews with them again 
@tanjas_world tanja never give up 
the united states needs to fix its own problems, of which there are many, first 
let the arab league take care of syria. why are these rich arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack? 
if we are going to continue to be stupid and go into syria (watch russia), as they say in the movies, shoot first and talk later 
i wonder what the great generals like patton, the big m, or robert e. lee would have thought about our stupid broadcasting of an attack? 
@walaa_3ssaf no, dopey, i would not go into syria, but if i did it would be by surprise and not blurted all over the media like fools. 
@janusdcjavu: @realdonaldtrump the one who talks much, does nothing except make 10 billion dollars go get a job dumbass 
@voicelikeariot_: @realdonaldtrump @washingtonpost: why obama is giving up the element of surprise in syria perhaps because he is stupid? 
@ronniedunn1164: @realdonaldtrump @hunterboss1996 a few billion more dollars, but i'd rather say president trump than president gates 
that said, the rich arab countries should get involved with the syrian mess, not us.we should start rebuilding our own country & military. 
why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack syria. why can't we just be quiet and, if we attack at all, catch them by surprise? 
i give the president's speech a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10 not bad but room for improvement 
why would anyone think obama would attack syria the day of his speech in washington. he doesn't want to detract from his press & glory. 
@jamieaydt: one day i hope to be successful & a bit controversial like @realdonaldtrump ...keeping things interesting & classy go for it 
@leavesofgrass_: @realdonaldtrump actually, i think it was factual and right on the mark. you are a vulture sir, nothing more. thank you 
@bx_bobby: @realdonaldtrump what was racist about that story? the story wasn't racist, just inaccurate and wrong. bryant is dumb & racist 




@dlhanno64: @janeygodley @realdonaldtrump donald makes you happy. .thats good ..we need something to make us happy with this president. 

@sonnset2 so true, not even close. 
@thulisakanzi have the arab league do it and pay for it.

.@foxnews legal analyst & former prosecutor @kimguilfoyle destroyed hack schneiderman’s suit on @fnthefive yesterday.she’s very sharp 
see @ivankatrump on the cover of @hudsonmod? view the digital edition:http://issuu.com/hudsonmod/docs/hudsonmod_sept13_c2c … 
there has been a systematic targeting of the tea party by the obama administration. now schneiderman goes after me. no coincidence. 
the lightweight hack schneiderman told ivanka that the “case is weak and more. meets with obama & then files one day later. 
has ag schneiderman been extorting his targets and their lawyers for contributions? we will find out. 
@givens1964 very cool, thanks. 
@aaronpha_q thanks. 
@d_murphy13 @realdonaldtrump purely a political move if he met w/obama,mr.trump please put the heat on this clown show 
i hope the ny tax payer appreciates the millions schneiderman is about to waste on a small case. i will litigate to victory. 

thug politics. lightweight hack schneiderman meets with obama on thursday, then brings frivolous suit on saturday. 
@elmarosuelvin thank you. 
my @foxandfriends int. destroying schneiderman’s frivolous suit which he brought after meeting obama on thurs.http://bit.ly/19urkxe  


@tuletwilight interesting 
@michaelpmulhall @cnbc i don't think he can 

why isn’t ag schneiderman going after democrat jon corzine and the $1.4 billion that is “missing?” 
amazing ag schneiderman sues a school w/ a 98% approval rating but doesn’t go after billion $ fraudsters all over wall st. 
i really enjoyed doing the show circuit this am discussing lightweight ag eric schneiderman & the terrible job he has done for ny. 
gov. cuomo's moreland comm should be looking at ag schneiderman shaking down those under investigation/ in litigation for campaign $$$ 
fox and friends

wow, l just found out that a.g. schneiderman met with president obama in syracuse on thursday and sued me on saturday same as irs etc. 
@tomnocera: @realdonaldtrump you are asking some really good questions. the truthful answers will come in time they always do.

@chowes247: @realdonaldtrump corzine is a evil schemer who stole 1.4 billion. trump starts a university to help people get rich & he's bad 
@heavyhauler19: @realdonaldtrump just swat that nat out of the air and roll on donald sadly, he's abusing the system 

what did our very stupid & ineffective a.g. eric schneidean, during his trips to my office, tell me about president obama & governor cuomo? 
after years of long stops then starts, why did dopey eric scheiderman tell people in the trump org. this case is going away,we have no case 
how can an attorney general ask for campaign contributions during his evaluation of a case a total sleazebag 
why did lightweight a.g. eric schneiderman come to my office on numerous occasions begging for campaign contributions? also, recent asks? 
why is it that eric schneiderman is considered a lightweight by so many and has failed to go after jon corzine and big abusers for billions? 
why did failing a.g. eric schneiderman, after years of looking, file his pathetic lawsuit on a saturday afternoon (unheard of)? no case 
lightweight a.g. eric schneiderman, who has been a total failure in office, failed to report the 98% approval rating of students for courses

if the gov't shuts down, it is because obama wants to make working americans buy obamacare while businesses and gov't are exempt.

all i can say is that if i were president, snowden would have already been returned to the u.s. (by their fastest jet) and with an apology 
snowden is doing great damage to our relations with other countries and u.s.prestige. china is laughing at us as he continues illegal action 
snowden is sitting in china and taunting the u.s. he is mocking us as a country. great time to place a tax on china trade if not turned over 
@peaceloveandmeg: but when you're in a beauty contest ran by @realdonaldtrump , all the contestants are republican. bad grammar (run).

like it or not, haters and losers, everybody is talking about miss u.s.a. and miss utah. by the way she is a fine young woman unfair to her. 
frankly, for a writer, i don’t think @dannyzuker’s stuff is good. in fact, it’s terrible. 
i own @dannyzuker, but he has his friends & haters & losers tweeting that he beat me. he can’t beat me at anything 
a country that does not control or respect its own borders is a country destined for failure. secure our borders

@dblsolo700 not concerned about them weren't they brutally mugging people in the park? go check your facts. 

likewise, the primary victims of violent crimes are in the african american and hispanic communities. these people want law and order now 
when it comes to violent crime, and if we are going to solve the problem, we must stop being so politically correct must tell it like it is 
sadly, the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics a tough subject must be discussed. 
according to bill o'reilly, 80% of all the shootings in new york city are blacks if you add hispanics, that figure goes to 98%. 1% white.

i commend roger ailes for publicly supporting @foxnews’ employees against the obama administration's intimidation of its reporters. 


who would be stupid enough to invest in @vattenfallgroup's ill conceived windfarm when it will lose £25m yearly? 
additionally, two executives @vattenfallgroup are under major investigation & they are unable to get the many permits necessary. 
.@vattenfallgroup, lead investor in aberdeen windfarm fiasco, has dropped out—project not economically viable & protestors hate it. 
@msaid10: @realdonaldtrump did you help? yes 
we spend billions of dollars helping nations all over the world but with hurricane sandy and oklahoma tornado not one nation helped us

@dannyzuker come on danny, are u afraid of the deal (be careful, i'm really good at deals). 
@dannyzuker bigger means bigger dummy, you really are stupid, aren't you 
@dannyzuker another racist remark by you, danny, are you a racist?

@danrpriest: @realdonaldtrump just out of curiosity, what makes you care so much about what they think? i study cowards and stupid people 
it should be mandatory that all haters and losers use their real name or identification when tweeting they will no longer be so brave 
@barrielouise: lol. what is going on @forq2 ? why is @realdonaldtrump threatening you? he's afraid to use his real name too costly

@forq2 are you making less than minimum wage, don't worry, the government will protect you. afraid to give your real name? you should be. 
@a11_seeing_eye: @realdonaldtrump @dam615 does an iq of 60 count as being smart? no, sadly you are very dumb but probably born that way.

@darjar14: @realdonaldtrump congrats mr. trump. frivolous lawsuits are a big problem in this country and issue should be addressed 
i loved beating these two terrible human beings. i would never recommend that anyone use her lawyer, he is a total loser 
jury was unanimous after hearing the made up case against my co. filed many years ago, she.and her pathetic lawyer should pay me big damages 
the so called 87 year old lady was a vicious and skilled investor who was trying to rip me off with made up facts and a blowhard lawyer.

pervert anthony wiener will never be able to get away from his perversion the cure rate is zero. 
.@vanityfair could come back if graydon carter paid as much attention as he does to his bad food restaurants. @condenastcorp 
if the great si newhouse were still running @condenastcorp, he would fire graydon carter immediately circulation tanking. 


use adverse events and monumental challenges to make you strong think big 
. @newsmax__media is one of the top media outlets in the country. @chrisruddynmx has revolutionized political commentary and reporting. 
jodi arias jury is having a hard time with the death penalty judge just sent them back for further deliberatuon. 
amazingly @anthonyweiner is going to run. the cure rate for his problem is 0. lots of other things will come out. 
graydon carter is laughing at the stupidity of chuck townsend on his contract renewal even he doesn't believe it @condenastcorp 
i can't believe @vanityfair would renew graydon carter's contract...... 
...... circulation is way down and all he thinks about are his bad food restaurants. @condenastcorp

why didn't president obama just go inside when it started raining yesterday common sense the two marines looked very uncomfortable & wet. 

the live finale of @apprenticenbc is this sunday at 9/8c. watch and see who will be the first ever all star celebrity apprentice. 

this sunday’s live finale of @apprenticenbc will be tough & nasty. be sure to watch @pennjillette & @traceadkins fight to the finish 

the sexual abuse that is so rampant has, according to generals, greatly weakened our military. they have failed to stop it. 
just in—all efforts to stop sexual abuse in the military have totally failed—in fact, the stoppers have become the abusers. 
.@nymag is a piece of garbage but i think it is very nice & charitable that they employ the no talent illiterate hack @jonathanchait. 

@ccv77 thanks, very nice. 
@funnsylvania: when is @realdonaldtrump going to finally get his own talk show? he would absolutely destroy the competition thanks time 
celebrity apprentice will be live on sunday at 9 pm (from new york city).casting has already begun for next season. 
@dstrick44: @realdonaldtrump @ricksmi54256322 you did run. and you had your ass handed you. never ran stupid, but i wish i had would have w 
in other words, our military has a very big problem 
unfortunately with some men when the poison kicks in (not me of course) there are no rules or guidelines in the military that will stop them 
i was never a fan of bush 2 for many reasons, including the fact that we should never have gone into iraq but once there, kept the oil dumb 
our very stupidly run country better stop being so politically correct or we won't have a country to run anymore 
many generals and military leaders are now saying i told you so they say this will have big impact on military strength & national sec. 
general says that the armed forces will be severely weakened if the large scale rape and sexual abuse problem is not brought under control. 
army officer who led a sexual abuse prevention unit was just fired after being charged with violently going after his wife.what is going on? 
america's top army general has warned of a crisis unless sexual abuse in the military is quickly brought undet control.forces greatly hurt 
@icyjordan: @realdonaldtrump do you like lebron as a player and person? @kingjames lebron is a great player and a great guy

@ahatwearer: @realdonaldtrump why are you suing an old lady? because she is rich and owes me money i am not stupid 
@chrisleahey1: @realdonaldtrump do you see president obama surviving these scandals ? sadly yes, but he will never be the same 
@_meagann: and @realdonaldtrump reminds me of my grandpa the smartest man i know. wow, great 
@mikemessina_: @realdonaldtrump needs to run for president he would be the best leader thanks mike. 
@lcbeaudoin big second amendment believer but background checks to weed out the sicko's are fine.

@janet_carswell @samflaherty_ thanks. 
@mikefromtn @mcuban @jeremypage3011 thanks michael. 
obama & his people did a brilliant job of delaying these scandals until after the election. mitt must be going wild thinking about it 
if these scandals happened before the election, obama could not have won. 
@jared808 @commonguymd @ap true 
@sarah_bales1 true and thanks. 
@roddy_brown thanks 
@polotodd804 this is one of the worst made and inaccurate documentaries i have ever seen. filmmaker mike tollin has zero talent.also boring

@birchtrees47: @realdonaldtrump cause there wouldn't be any scandals if you were in office.. true and no stupidity

@philipmorrow that would be great philip 
@matthewsmales1: @realdonaldtrump is a great american a role model to many read all of his books been a fan since he was in wwe a great guy 
@chris_l54: @sportsguru77 @tweetontilt @realdonaldtrump @mcuban if you real art of the deal, you'd know that donald did it all on his own. 
@samahdanash: think big is the most amazing book i have ever read. @realdonaldtrump

@qfivefarms thanks and true 
@jwalkerkid: @realdonaldtrump you win on tv shows hands down you are a successful person ...... i love all the shows u have come up with 
@chris_l54: @realdonaldtrump @mcuban hadn't even heard of 'the benefactor' til donald mentioned it. big fail.. donald wins the tv war. 
@leebandoni: @realdonaldtrump time for you to instruct the bbc to replace him, he has the personality of a tea bag 

@wvucheme: @realdonaldtrump the real shark tank is the boardroom on @apprenticenbc 
@seanheilweil: @realdonaldtrump damn you really like getting @mcuban fired up to squash you like a bug huh? he doesn't have the strength 
@damiranz: @realdonaldtrump , i'm a big fan but sometimes you just need to shut up,you talk too much probably true, but i'm having fun 
@persvanstrom based on your picture i can see why you look lost and in need of a cheap lifeline. 
@therealryanmatt: @realdonaldtrump i never seen apprentice or shark tank am i a fat loser? no, just a loser 
@mikeluis93 mark cuban is a bully who is physically very soft and therefore should immediately stop wearing t shirts. no strength 
@lord_sugar can't hold a.candle to donald.trump he is a laughing stock in great britain (but his show pays me lots of money, so i'm happy) 
the success of shark tank over the years is a total joke compared to the success of the apprentice, one of the biggest hits in t.v. history. 
@african11 but i love insulting people who don't have the goods but think they do 

@mcuban is a short ball hitter who had a massive failure on television, the benefactor. now he is one of many on a modest ratings show, s t. 
@brianlynch @durantrandy thanks, no wonder our country is in such trouble 
@lennydopkin i have not run it for many years, i sold it a long time ago (great deal, great timing). when i owned it, a top place 
@heavensbug thank you and very true 
@durantrandy: @realdonaldtrump mr. trump; some of these losers just don't get it. they need to look at why your on top. 
@patti0713 thanks patti. 
@nieldi @lord sugar can't get himself arrested but at least he's making me money keep begging sugar you dog 
@maxvayner your man, little jon s(?) can't win, he's not smart enough or quick enough 
@caaataclysm little jon stewart(?) is a pussy, he would be hopeless in a debate with me 
@maxvayner stewart (?) wouldn't have even a little chance in a debate with me. he's totally overrated not fast enough or smart enough 
@noma2300 you must be kidding i kicked both of their ugly assses 
@doralaquatics: @realdonaldtrump woohoo have lived in doral for 14 years and city is excited for trump upgrades welcome thanks 
@guerrillatycoon not even close he is just, as you know, a very bad copy (who i profit from). 
@chef_riggy i never endorsed judd i'm with senator mitch all the way 
@m_plem: @realdonaldtrump @lord do you ever take the high road? when i'm dealing with garbage like @lord sugar, no 
@callumpriest: @realdonaldtrump he is a lord for a reason but nobody can figure out what that reason is 

just left trump national doral in miami under massive construction the blue monster will be one of the greatest courses ever built 
@ocamericans: i only watch @nbc once a week to watch @realdonaldtrump's apprentice. great

@feksbaby very nice, thanks 
@grtblankenship: @realdonaldtrump is definitely the best personality i follow on twitter. inspiration and role model all together 
@pennystocksblog you are 100% correct thank you 

dummy, i'm asking a question look at the question mark at the end of the sentence use your head. 
.@limbaugh is right. watergate is much different than benghazi. no one died in watergate.

@samflaherty_: @realdonaldtrump i'd bet my life savings obama has a higher iq than you you would lose 
@joshrosenfield: .@realdonaldtrump and yet he refuses to release his iq results to the public. what are you hiding, mr. trump. ask obama 
a warren buffett corp. is currently ensnared in a bankruptcy. likewise icahn, kravis, apollo and many others have played the game.thanks 
@bagshotrow: @realdonaldtrump which internet test told you this i would like to match wits with the trumpster you wouldn't have a chance 
@madamsuzette: @realdonaldtrump u were right jodi arias should have listened to u thanks, but i'm glad she didn't. 
@rodmonium91: @realdonaldtrump mr trump, do you support the death penalty? yes 
@menacesocietyut little jon stewart(?) is getting his ass kicked and you and all of his high priced writers know it don't panic jon. 
@dlayphoto: @realdonaldtrump is that why you’ve filed for bankruptcy numerous times? i never filed for bankruptcy asshole 
@jeremypage3011 mark cuban can't beat me at anything. he is one of many on shark tank and apprentice has been a much, much bigger show 
@2go2there: @realdonaldtrump remember that one time you came to @libertyu ? that was cool of you thanks i loved it great school 
@njwinegeek: @realdonaldtrump but jon stewart has a much higher iq. wrong, jon stewart(?) is an obnoxious lightweight with a lower i.q. 
jodi thought she outsmarted the system it didn't work congratulations to the jury on a job well done now, will it be life or death? 
@hotair25159: @realdonaldtrump lol.. justice for travis it shows that the legal system is still intact good news 
man, we had a great day today at trump tower lots of money was given to many people who really needed it good feelings and happiness 
sorry losers and haters, but my i.q. is one of the highest and you all know it please don't feel so stupid or insecure,it's not your fault

people do not assume this but more than anything else, i like helping people. be at trump tower at 11 am today. 
residential capital, a company in which warren buffett is involved, went bankrupt but that doesn't mean that warren buffett went bankrupt 
i'm giving away money 11am trump tower. be there or be left behind 
i would absolutely kill jon stewart(?) in a debate it would be no contest he's not fast enough or smart enough (only obnoxious enough ). 
@sportswalnuts and jon stewart(?) is a very little man hiding behind lot's of high priced writers without which he would be nothing 
@rosannascotto: why are you giving away money this am @realdonaldtrump ? because so many people need help 
@calikal69: @realdonaldtrump what do you think of @billmaher? i don't think of bill maher and nobody else does either. 
@markdrucker1: @realdonaldtrump i wish you'd spend more time building people up rather than tearing them down. i only tear down losers. 
@jgarrett214: @prayahater: @realdonaldtrump go on his show and teach him how its done no joke writers. he is soft and easy. 
@asmarks18: @realdonaldtrump i dont care for stewart but do you ever shut up? i never give up 
just watched jon stewart(?) jumping up and down and screaming like a madman nothing funny or smart, just loud and obnoxious, a pushy dope 
@chriscjackson: @realdonaldtrump i'm pretty sure your wife is cheating on you at this exact second. sorry, no one else can satisfy her 
@gdelag: @realdonaldtrump @rodmonium91 just ck how many followers have each follower. but i notice you follow loser boredom without trump 

@rodmonium91: @realdonaldtrump any truth to the rumor you bought some of your 2.1mil followers? no,i'm too cheap 
@suzmo816: @realdonaldtrump she could share an apartment with casey anthony very witty but not very funny

@heaveenly: @realdonaldtrump how does it feel to have 2.1 million followers great like owning the new york times without the lo$$es . 
wow, i love stimulating debate and driving certain people crazy the generals were forced to do something they didn't want to do (not me). 
@troymoe1: @realdonaldtrump mark sanford just won his house seat back so maybe jodi can run against hillary in 2016 
@nickbrinley: @realdonaldtrump if they're unreported, how do you know there's 26,000 of them? reported tonight by all major newscasts. 
is it even slightly possible that jodi arias could be set free wow, what a miscarriage of justice that would be 
the jury in the jodi arias trial is, believe it or not, still out. you never know but such a long deliberation could be good for the defense 
@fresh_entertain: @realdonaldtrump do you ever go to the isle of lewis? yes, great place my wonderful mother was born there 
the generals and top military brass never wanted a mixer but were forced to do it by very dumb politicians who wanted to be politically c 
26,000 unreported sexual assults in the military only 238 convictions. what did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?

@digitalpianoman: @realdonaldtrump you do more good just commenting on twitter than most haters do their whole lives 
26,000 sexual assaults or rapes reported in military last year and that is just the number that is reported (many do not want to report). 
sexual assault and rape in the armed forces is a massive problem that nobody wants to talk about or do anything about the big dark secret 
head of air force's anti sexual assault unit arrested for sexual assault it just seems that our country is not what it used to be.

as i’ve said many times before, jon stewart @thedailyshow is highly overrated. 
jon stewart @thedailyshow is a total phony –he should cherish his past—not run from it. 
if jon stewart is so above it all & legit, why did he change his name from jonathan leibowitz? he should be proud of his heritage 
what’s funny about the name “f**kface von clownstick” it was not coined by jon leibowitz he stole it from some moron on twitter. 
amazing how the haters & losers keep tweeting the name “f**kface von clownstick” like they are so original & like no one else is doing it...

why are some more concerned with granting terrorist rights than protecting innocent americans? 
our trade deficit is still on pace to be over $500b. this is killing our manufacturing sector and sending jobs overseas.

all star celebrity @apprenticenbc is down to the five final contestants. getting fired now is when it really hurts

“being true to yourself and your work is an asset. remember that assets are worth protecting.” – think like a champion 
ignorance is inexcusable; it’s the surest way to fail. no acceptable reason exists for not being well informed. 
this sunday’s all star celebrity @apprenticenbc features the return of @joan_rivers. sunday at 9 pm on @nbc full 2 hours. 
“when you expect things to happen strangely enough they do happen.” j. p. morgan 
often times being ‘innovative’ is simply putting together pre existing elements into something new. be resourceful & expect success. 
get ready for fireworks…@joan_rivers & @thegarybusey face off in the board room this sunday on all star celebrity @apprenticenbc. 
does bush’s library have a wing featuring supreme court justice jon robert’s obamacare ruling? roberts was his prize appointee 

the boston terrorist thugs’ mother is also a radical. i am sure she will be granted citizenship shortly. 

study your area of business. all business involves risk, but risk can be reduced when you learn everything you can about what you’re doing. 
can @pennjillette @lisarinna and @thegarybusey continue to co exist? find out on this sunday’s celebrity all star @apprenticenbc. 
to be in charge, you have to take responsibility, you have to instill confidence. it’s like being a conductor set the tempo. 

do as i say, not as i do.the politicians who passed obamacare are now exempting themselves from the monstrosityhttp://politi.co/zlvtze  
house republicans should be doing everything possible to defund obamacare. instead leadership is funding ithttp://politi.co/13xhe8h  
@frankibe i certainly did in spades. 
@afolasoji so true. 
@dbagsloveme i will, thanks 
we need another bush in office about as much as we need obama to have a 3rd term. no more bushes 

dangerous. while obama is cutting down our military, china has announced plans to build more aircraft carriershttp://bloom.bg/12hbxg9  
after tearing w bush down for 12 years, now the media loves him. why not? he gave them obama. 
pervert alert serial sexter @anthonyweiner has promised to use twitter as a “tool.” parents,make sure your children have him blocked. 
weiner says many more pictures may be out there—this is just what nyc needs, a pervert mayor. 


@mschrock4 i never went bankrupt, you dope 
@abtheproducer maybe obama?

the sub station in blackdog is very dangerous on unregulated landfill—fire hazard @alexsalmond @pressjournal 
the council is concerned over the health & safety for the village of blackdog w/ placement of sub station. @alexsalmond @pressjournal 
the council was shocked by the exuberance of the demonstration in blackdog. @alexsalmond @pressjournal

i believe lance armstrong had death wish when he did interview w/oprah—as i predicted, everybody is suing him, he’ll have nothing left 
@tokodi1 see trump tower 
@dpmurphy93 that's true they all ask 
by rejecting my ad on ugly windmills & @alexsalmond’s faulty thinking on the “lockerbie bomber” the ad is now on worldwide newscasts. 


watch out. champion @joan_rivers returns to the boardroom as a judge in this week’s all star celebrity @apprenticenbc. don't cross her

sen. @maxbaucus has announced his retirement. a major proponent of obamacare, baucus now says it’s a ‘huge train wreck.’ 
the boston killer applying today for obamacare. he demands that medical bills be taken care of immediately. does this include dental?

i promise you that i'm much smarter than jonathan leibowitz i mean jon stewart @thedailyshow. who, by the way, is totally overrated.

@_hub__: @realdonaldtrump: grew up in family business at a time when passion & competitiveness were the norm. we have lost that trump drive 
the mother of the boston killers (not suspects) says her boys are totally innocent and were set up i can see the 14 year long defense now 
lance armstrong just got sued by the federal government they want their money back i told you so what was he thinking when he did that int? 
@cindykempl: @realdonaldtrump : mr trump, i personally enjoy your tweets some are very informative thank you for your words of wisdom 
scotland does not have free press, even when you are just stating the facts it's crazy 
@ruralbeeffarmer big pollution during manufacturing and building process

@mtomassetti22: @realdonaldtrump so should the makers of this documentary be fired? no, but they should state the true facts no angels 
@bostonred: @realdonaldtrump where is the evidence ? all over the place 
@coolboybrand: @realdonaldtrump the point of the documentary is that they were innocent they were attacking innocent people in the park , 
@fun_foy: @realdonaldtrump didn't some other guy admit to actually committing this brutal crime? yes, but they committed other attacks

@davyshanks: advertising standards authority has ruled @realdonaldtrump anti windfarm ad misleading not misleading, very truthful 
the central park five documentary was a one sided piece of garbage that didn't explain the.horrific crimes of these young men while in park 
@bitchforshort victim never died so they would not have been given death penalty but did you see what these innocent boys were doing? 
@davyshanks: advertising standards authority has ruled @realdonaldtrump anti windfarm ad misleading. political ruling to save joker salmond 
@gerhardm_com perhaps, but the country is in really big trouble i do love real estate though (and am seriously good at it).

if your enemies end up liking you it’s because they beat you. you want their respect, not their friendship. 

next time you are waiting in an emergency room remember the boston killer was rushed to intensive care within minutes of capture. 

will barack obama personally read the boston terrorist his miranda rights? 
@markkcole happy birthday mark. 
.@thegarybusey survives another week of all star celebrity @apprenticenbc. gary is shifty and playing to win.

@tdudz5: @realdonaldtrump you r the most honest and real person on twitter. twitter was invented for trump thanks, very nice 
@leigh26heather savannah, work hard in school 
@macgecko: @wsquared58 @realdonaldtrump @fastfranky5 @macy @goangelo actually the first of many trump ties because of look, feel, quality 
@clutchba11er: @realdonaldtrump i know you wear mainly brioni ties. that's wrong, i wear trump ties that are sold at macy's. 

me, by a lot 
@doctor_trey: @realdonaldtrump i say if obama is so set on universal background checks, we run a background check on him. very interesting 
will be doing fox and friends at 7 a.m. (in 20 minutes). 

@jbailey1987 yes we can oh foolish one, terrorists should not have the right to remain silent 
@shootar401: @realdonaldtrump you need to run for president and get this country back on the right track trump 2016 thank you 
@angrycrank: @realdonaldtrump you are a terrible human being. that's only because you don't know me 
my ties and shirts are doing very big numbers @macy's, beyond my wildest thoughts thanks @goangelo and the rest of the losers for mentions 



looking forward to @thegarybusey's book of buseyisms 









i hope you are watching the apprentice...tonight's show is great and brett michaels is back 
everybody loves @bretmichaels he’s a great champion and this is where he should be. he agrees 

.@traceadkins presents the nj coast red cross a $40,000 check for sandy relief. you can tell he’s very pleased about that & rightly so. 

what do you think of water boarding the boston killer sometime prior to allowing our doctors to make him well? i suspect he may talk 
make the boston killer talk before our doctors make him better. once he is well he will say, speak to my lawyers. 
don't forget to watch celebrity apprentice tonight at 9pm...you will love it 
i don't know how al michaels could have been drunk and arrested on friday night if he was totally sharp on saturday morning. 
great sportscaster al michaels, a friend of mine, played golf with me on saturday morning at trump national, la. he was in perfect shape 
if the boston killer applies for obama care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand 
no mercy to terrorists you dumb bastards 
can you imagine the boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms, legs and worse 
bullshit pop gave me knowledge and a relatively small amount of money (split between brothers and sisters) and i built it into over 9 bill. 
@bracybuilders: @realdonaldtrump just a playboy 
@coachclintswan tell me, what were they doing in the park, playing checkers? 
watch gary b tonight on celebrity apprentice some really crazy things happen 
getting back to the nicer and more normal parts of life, celebrity apprentice is great tonight on nbc at 9. it will be a full two hour show 
@ajbarker50: @realdonaldtrump do you try to make everything about you? yes 
@nextlevelstoner great 
you are right, the media is always offending donald trump they have no limits but they will do anything not to offend the boston killer 
i know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually i'm a very compassionate person (with a very high iq) with strong common sense 
didn't the boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away? we are not dealing with an innocent baby here death 
when the stupid people start feeling sorry for the boston killer and want to release him and give him medals, remember the killings maimings 
i hate when the news media, so afraid to offend anyone, always refers to the boston killer as the suspect . 
the shirts and ties at macy's are so good beautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piece l kicked his ass 
i just won a big court decision (n.y. post) against some character who claimed i owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties. 
oh no, they are worried that they didn't read the boston killer his rights and he may have a good legal argument. 12 year case to finish? t 
@joetran19: @realdonaldtrump how do u feel about marco rubio? drinks too much water

@mikeohio2323: @rob_bieber @realdonaldtrump tell the victims and their families about this guy's rights. terrible 
@sverriss: @realdonaldtrump what good will killing him/her do? he'll never kill again and others will start to think about consequences 
should be public execution for all to see you will end this bullshit fast 
@the_indypendent: @realdonaldtrump maybe anthony weiner can serve as editor in chief but then @cnn would become x rated 
get all the info, then quick trial, then death penalty for the boston killer of innocent children and people do not be kind. 

.@cnn should stop apologizing for the mistake they made the other day & get back to reporting 

@marlborostan you've got it mixed up. chechnya is not the czech republic. 
lots of comments—do you really believe these two brothers operated alone without influence of others? 
the @fbipressoffice, police & others are doing an amazing job. how genius was it putting together that tape? 
these tsarnaev brothers did not work alone. they had help and assistance from other cell members. be vigilant and on the lookout.

druggie a rod, @mlb’s biggest fraud, is lucky george steinbrenner is no longer with us. @yankees would have voided his contract. 
@gauravk725 great 
@blake1swanson thanks. 
it is terrible that neither obama, biden nor kerry attended lady thatcher’s funeral. they would all run to muslim brotherhood morsi’s. 
business is easy. dealing with people is hard. if you are an entrepreneur, your most important job is to choose who works with you. 

the chinese must still be laughing at kerry’s trip to china. he got nothing, gave them everything and promised even more. 
had a fantastic time at yesterday’s all star @apprenticenbc press conference with @stephenbaldwin7 in @trumptowerny.

my performance from last week on david letterman @late_show will be re aired tonight at 11:35 pm on cbs. 
always remember that as your success grows, you will be asked for more favors. learn how to say ‘no.’ it is critical. 
“be up front and direct with people, and they will return the favor.” – think like a billionaire 
where is the president? it is time for him to come on tv and show strength against the repeated threats from north korea and others. 
the only american who has met with the north korean man child is dennis rodman. isn’t that frightening and sad? 
china controls north korea. so now besides cyber hacking us all day, they are using the norks to taunt us. china is a major threat. 



all eyes are on @tigerwoods @the_masters. he’s in good position

margaret thatcher was the iron lady of the west. she promoted freedom & democracy a great leader & ally of america.

this sunday’s all star celebrity @apprenticenbc has the most beautiful boardroom judges ever w/ @ivankatrump & @melaniatrump together 

only 88,000 jobs were added this past march. prediction was 190,000. businesses can’t expand with obama care & high taxes on horizon.

james holmes, the aurora, colorado guy who killed 12 people & injured 58 others, is fighting hard to avoid the death penalty...

what will happen to omarosa tonight? one of our all time great episodes 
i hope everyone, or rather almost everyone, had a great easter we need our leaders to make great and wise decisions in these troubled times 
so, what will happen to the big o on celebrity apprentice tonight. remember, i only fire people when it is deserved, not for other reasons 
big night on celebrity apprentice tonight. important, starts at 10 p.m. as scheduled but nbc just increased all future episodes to 2 hours 
have a great easter, i love you all 
no, i'm saying that the world is paying the price for china's pollution while they make a fortune with their dirty factories very sad. 
@kimstagliano: @realdonaldtrump when will nyt write about vaccine damage and its price? 3 girls w autism here, mr. trump. they should kim 
major article in new york times today discusses the cost of environmental damage in china and how it is rapidly growng rest of world pays. 
china is the biggest environmental polluter in the world, by far. they do nothing to clean up their factories and laugh at our stupidity 
we have tremendous economic power over china if our leaders knew how to use it, which they don't china's economy would collapse without us. 
@sullythinks: why is @realdonaldtrump not the president of the us right now? a very good question 
@thejbrain: @realdonaldtrump very well said. the united states needs people like you to show what truly leadership means so true 
@kaiser1859: @realdonaldtrump what is the solution mr trump? leadership 
what do we get from our economic competitor south korea for the tremendous cost of protecting them from north korea? nothing 
north korea is reliant on china. china could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders.

@genaleenolin thank you gln 
current @nymag really sad, not only boring but highly inaccurate. use better paper product looks like a death march (which it is ). 
@nikkio: @realdonaldtrump just read book contagious, why things catch on reminded me of u ur one of a kind :) thank you 
have a great good friday and a happy easter. 
find out who and what is the best in your field. identify the trendsetters, leaders and authorities. learn the standards they follow. 
achievers go for the challenge, so the next deal is what they're thinking about. they have an obligation to best themselves.

@kevingsmithjr: .@realdonaldtrump i often times don't agree with you politically, but i enjoyed your interview on letterman. thanks 
@dmbgreyst: @realdonaldtrump @nymag agreed. i won't be renewing. i got back issues that are paper weights. bad people, false writing 
@elisa_oggero: @realdonaldtrump late show was great we all enjoy it thanks 

@nymag new york magazine sucks lifeless and dead one of the most boring out there. get it now, it won't last long 

adam moss, editor in chief of @nymag is quickly losing his reputation in that @nymag has become so boring and so irrelevant. 
employees of @nymag should have their resumes updated. it is very boring & will die in the near future. how much are they losing now? 

...at the same time, go through a worst case scenario but keep it short. focus on your goal—look at the solution, not the problem. 
practice positive thinking—this will keep you focused while weeding out anything that is unnecessary, negative or detrimental...

@the_obm: @realdonaldtrump i am a local aberdonian. the coast is beautiful it will be totally ruined with these vile, ugly turbines. 
@agallegos32 thanks 
@nicla_b: @realdonaldtrump @alexsalmond @pressjournal @johnduthie1 was doing the same, thinking, salmond has lost his mind 
@markyoungco: @realdonaldtrump @alexsalmond @pressjournal @johnduthie1 hasn't anyone learned anything from tboone pickens' disaster. 
@kalevans: @realdonaldtrump iowa is the second leading state in the nation when it comes to wind energy sad distinction, farm land lost 
@markyoungco @alexsalmond @pressjournal @johnduthie1 
.@alexsalmond @pressjournal rt @johnduthie1 just sitting here looking out over aberdeen bay. these clowns cannot be allowed... 
... to build a wind farm and destroy this view 
.@alexsalmond @pressjournal rt @djkevritch im proud to be scottish, but bonnie scotland will soon be a thing of the past w/ these windmills 
.@alexsalmond @pressjournal rt @gaillorene ask our canadian neighbors who abhor the windfarms. and poor scotland 
@slainsview blackdog folks are very smart their home values & lives will be destroyed. 
@dbpresswire @late_show i hope so 
@jessilin02 fantastic food thanks. 
@spewrange thanks @howardstern is great 
@creelken hope i do well 
@brocktonconwell great thanks. 
getting ready to do the david letterman @late_show tonight—i hope you all will watch—i think 
aberdeenshire coast is spectacular. its historic value & wildlife will be tarnished if these wind turbines are built but they won't be 
to all journalists, look into the financial dealings of scottish parliament members with vattenfall…follow the money. 
less than two weeks until @wwe’s @wrestlemania xxix. @therock v. @johncena willbe epic excited to be inducted into the hall of fame. 
.@erictrumpfdn continues to do important work for @stjude children’s research hospital. i am very proud of @erictrump's philanthropy. 
@jnorr11 yes and thanks. 
@nashvillebobby thanks bobby. 
@mistermcflee thanks and good luck 
@thedealszone @washtimes thank you. 
@smalltwnbignews kate all my best wishes to you. 
@themayormatt interesting and often true 
.@pennjillette is an extraordinary entertainer & magician whose star on the hollywood walk of fame is long overdue. very proud of him. 
congrats to fantastic all star @apprenticenbc celebrity & illusionist @pennjillette on being honored at 2013 hollywood walk of fame 



the developer of the scottish wind monstrosities, vattenfall, just laid off 2,500 people & has serious financial difficulties. 
general petraeus should stop apologising and get on with his life. he is a good man and should have a great future. 
the new selection of ties, shirts and suits at macy's is amazing also available in trump tower lobby. 
i'm doing the david letterman show tonight should be interesting 
@genaleenolin great call me, we'll get you on 
great piece on extra tonight re. celebrity apprentice 
@specialk211: @realdonaldtrump i really miss @bretmichaels on all star apprentice will he be back as a judge? yes 
sometimes we do things to build up experience and stamina to prepare, but it's to prepare us for something bigger. 
many of @tigerwoods’ ‘friends’ were quick to abandon him in his time of crisis. now tiger knows who he can count on. 
many people look at successful people & don't see anything but the end result. they don't see all the work that went into getting there. 
when somebody challenges you, fight back be tough 
when someone can discourage you, you probably aren't determined enough. be resolute. that's what it takes to get things done. 


@seanhooligan6 @alexsalmond this is from someone who knows they are a disaster. 


...and now alex salmond pushes ugly turbines 


the scottish windfarm was conceived by the same mind that released terrorist al megrahi for humanitarian reasons. .. 
…al megrahi was the man who blew up pan am flight 103 over lockerbie, scotland. 
@uberburgers trump national golf club los angeles. 
@javi8104 great good luck. 
@samryzen thank you 


.@tigerwoods has made a truly great comeback he is number one again give him credit, comebacks are tough to do. way to go tiger. 
for all of my many jewish friends, happy passover.

they changed the name from “global warming” to “climate change” after the term global warming just wasn’t working (it was too cold) 
it’s springtime and it just started snowing in nyc. what is going on with global warming? 
uh oh… @omarosa & @piersmorgan once again reunite in the board room in next week’s ‘all star’ @apprenticenbc. fireworks 

last night’s all star @apprenticenbc once again showed why the ultimate onus lies with the project manager. the buck stops there. 








.@joan_rivers —i know you’re watching what did you think of your impersonator? 










@en_somat: @realdonaldtrump your apprentice is so much better than ours in the uk. you're so much better than alan sugar thanks

@philzentz thanks phil 

wow they are really killing jay leno let him go out with dignity 
@warrencasselljr: @ctrain_ the truth will soon be revealed and everyone will say @realdonaldtrump was right many people think so 
@yassinomar: the amount of trump towers in new york city is ridiculous. no simple man can build such an empire like .@realdonald thanks 
@ctrain_: @realdonaldtrump honestly who gives a shit where obama was born? it's where he lives now that's the problem interesting 
don't blindly pursue a career that others suggest or insist is right for you. it may be worth taking a pay cut for a job you love. 

looks like the u.s. will be having the coldest march since 1996 global warming anyone????????? 


watching the madness in cyprus? if our government keeps spending trillion dollar deficits, that could happen here. 
this sunday's all star @apprenticenbc features some of the biggest fireworks of the entire season. get ready. 

rt @ewerickson: personally i think it is awesome that @realdonaldtrump listens to @dloesch on the radio. she's awesome. 
@michellemalkin @igo4par true. 
.@michellemalkin would be nothing without being on the @seanhannity show. i don’t see what sean sees in her—loser 
@jimmymcgreevy thanks jim 
@sharleneh thank you. 
when i think big, which is often, you can be sure i’m aware of the enormous amount of little things that we will have to account for. 
@chrisstackstacy thank you. 
@cbalfer very nice chris thanks 
@dafny01 do not give up, keep moving forward. 
@jbail33 yes. 
@davidshuster i don't, but europeans are being discriminated against very unfair 
@michellemalkin you were born stupid 
@michellemalkin at least dummy is true 
@1fos1 pay attention, study more than what is required, keep your focus on the big picture. and good luck. 
see yourself as an organization. pay attention to every facet of your life. what’s strong? what’s weak? what’s missing? 
“the difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits.” albert einstein 
there won’t be any new gun legislation. no surprise. americans support the 2nd amendment. 
life always presents new opportunities you would never expect. i hosted @wrestlemania & then i starred in one, which sold most ppvs. 
make no mistake, obamacare is the first step towards changing our health system into single payer. just a disaster. 
problem with @gop is not their message, it’s that they are incapable of controlling the message. 

“here’s something about donald trump, he’s got a top rated show on tv and everything he says becomes a headline.” @dloesch all true 
yes, all star @apprenticenbc contestant @thegarybusey is a little out there. but he uses his ‘uniqueness’ to his advantage. 
it won’t stay a buyer’s market forever. if you can, take advantage and buy property asap. you’ll thank me 

remember the golden rule of negotiating: he who has the gold makes the rules. 
it’s snowing & freezing in nyc. what the hell ever happened to global warming? 
.@mcuban mark—nice picture, thanks for the invite to the mavs/nets game. next time i’ll go and you’ll win 
@ianrambally great going 
celebrity apprentice on in 5 minutes on cnbc it's great 
@champion278: @realdonaldtrump i have to say your a better host than alan sugar who does the uk version thanks 
celebrity apprentice on cnbc tonight at 9. 
the @celebapprentice will be broadcast tonight on @cnbc at 9 pm. 
haters, stop saying i went bankrupt, it is not so. i never went bankrupt... 
... but like many other great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage. 
for the haters, out of hundreds of deals or transactions, i have used the bankruptcy laws 4 times in order to cut better deals. 
almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool... 
... icahn, kravis, apollo and most others but nobody says they went bankrupt 
people buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals... 
... it is very effective and a commonly used business tool. 
why do the losers & haters always say i wear a “wig” when they know i don’t. like it or not, it’s all mine—just ask barbara walters. 
@martinfagervik win 
@realhotwaffles thanks. 
@chrisr52 happy birthday christine. 
@balloon_69 @afchaywards good luck 
@miawesbrooks @dcexaminer very nice 
@mscattitude1 @apprenticenbc great and thanks. 
@nycal821 @nbc @celebapprentice thanks cheryl. 
my shirts, ties & suits (and fragrance, success) are doing great go over & check out macy’s now—beautiful new selection 
. @omarosa is smart and strategic. people should cut her some slack and respect the way she works on @apprenticenbc. 
@iklemieux @therealkiyosaki thanks and good luck. 
@felinemenice great 

. @wwe’s @wrestlemania xxix less than 3 weeks away. looking forward to being inducted into the hall of fame 
@t_thabane happy birthday. 
the nfl has just barred ball carriers from using helmet as contact. what is happening to the sport? the beginning of the end. 
“playing golf with business associates creates a relaxing atmosphere where everyone has fun...

@dolehnyc quite nice, thanks 
@bburt2367 trump, by far 
@chesterstarr @hardball_chris chester unreal. 
board room finale of this week’s all star @apprenticenbc will leave viewers wondering where the rest of the season goes…it's great 
it’s a shame to hear that the @dcexaminer is failing. no one wants the paper, even if it is being handed out for free. 
@fatmaemadi thank you. 
@jaynielea thanks jaynie. 
@jcfields13 thanks jason. 
@yokoono john was great everybody misses him. best wishes. 
.@nbc just announced that all 1 hour @celebapprentice episodes are being expanded to 2 hours—it’s amazing what good ratings will do 

i remained strong for @tigerwoods during his difficult period. he rewarded me (and himself) by winning at trump national doral. 

.@hardball_chris’ very small audience is shrinking rapidly because people finally understand that he is very very dumb 
@tinaclean yes and best wishes. 
@mandmpanelbeat thanks and good luck. 
@lfoshie: there are 2 people with whom you don't want to be on their bad side god's... & @realdonaldtrump's i want to be on god's side 
@whatitlooklike9: @realdonaldtrump @mcuban nobody is on the dons level. lets be honest donald trump is the man very nice, thank you 
@c_hanson800 hi chris 
you can have the best product in the world, but if people don't know about it, it's not going to be worth much. the art of the deal

@emilyplacido @mcuban emily true and thanks. 
.@mcuban mark, okay with me but don't start your bullshit again 
passion motivates. passionate people don't give up; their zeal eliminates fear. passion can also create business opportunities. 

congratulations to @likud_party mk @dannydanon on being offered deputy defense minister of idf by @israelipm @netanyahu. 
if you’re sitting in an office working in a job you hate, then it’s time to think big and plan your next step… 
@hayesrutherford yes and thanks. 
@cforcolby hi colby. 
10 yrs ago today, the iraq war began. 4,485 of our nation’s finest have not returned home alive. iran will soon control iraq & its oil. 
amnesty is suicide for republicans.not one of those 12 million who broke our laws will vote republican.obama is laughing at @gop. 
.@rnc report was written by the ruling class of consultants who blew the election. short on ideas. just giving excuses to donors. 
one of the most obvious lessons on @apprenticenbc is for the candidates to learn to think quickly. think like a champion 
does anyone remember the fight @mcuban had w/ the referee—he was weak & pathetic—a non athlete trying to live life thru his players. 
why do shows have @ananavarro—ntl hispanic chair for the losing mccain ’08 & huntsman ’12. she’s a loser who doesn’t deliver votes. 
sorry folks, but donald trump is far richer and much better looking than dopey @mcuban 
@jrkirk22 thanks. 
@beaumontanthony thanks anthony. 
@__jibz true 
@ilpostio that's why i'll never be pope 
all star celebrity @apprenticenbc continues to surprise our loyal viewers each and every week. more, and bigger, coming… 
it was just announced that @erinburnett won’t be going to mornings on cnn. @outfrontcnn just made a wise decision. 
.@sarahpalinusa did a great job @cpacnews. much of what she said was plain old common sense. 
.@hardball_chris became a super liberal obama fan only because he must need the money and on @msnbc that’s the way it is. 

.@erinburnett should have stayed at cnbc—she was never smart, but people liked her. @outfrontcnn jeff zucker’s got problems 
for beauty and flight, i’ll take the @boeing 757 over the @boeing 787 any day 
l still think @boeing should just bite the bullet & get rid of the new batteries in the 787. those batteries will always be a problem 

.@erinburnett’s @outfrontcnn ratings are so pathetic, she even loses to @hardball_chris at 7pm which is replay of 5pmhttp://bit.ly/ymi1s7  

i don’t like seeing the pope standing at the checkout counter (front desk) of a hotel in order to pay his bill. it’s not pope like 
.@hardball_chris is a really dumb guy(and i know him well)—that’s why he works swimmingly with our leaders in washington. 
re: cpac “the crowd in the main room filled to capacity by the end of trump’s address, something his operative said he planned to do... 
.... to help mcconnell, who spoke right after him.”@breitbartnews 
i was sorry to decline headlining the reagan dinner last saturday due to a prior business commitment. pres. reagan was one of the greats. 
.@rushlimbaugh played 3 separate audio bites (the most of anyone) of my cpac speech. hour 3 in friday's show. 
be weak on immigration and ensure democratic victory. 
.@rushlimbaugh is right—the republicans lost because they weren’t conservative enough—or tough enough. 
but @mcuban is physically weak, he has no clubhead speed or game 
@dennizenx thanks 
@doyle5smom thanks 
@geeopee: @realdonaldtrump why are you wasting your time with cuban? you are right 
@kimfloyd2012: @realdonaldtrump ... hope you have a great day loved your speech at cpac. thanks kim 

@niecey911logan thanks 

@billdaley1 true 
.@mcuban is so short off the tee he can't have much of a punch. he's just a weak man with a big mouth 
@julzz: @realdonaldtrump you got bankrupted 3 times, who the hell trusts you with anything i never went bankrupt, moron 
@greenolive_r: @mcuban is trumping the trumpster himself @realdonaldtrump where do you live, moron. 
who is going to get iraq's oil??????? 
bombings all over iraq today.that country is falling apart such a horrible waste of lives and 1.5 trillion dollars (and i told you so ). 
@jackvoices you are correct, but he is so easy 
@mcuban is very short off the tee and his basketball sucks also 
golf match? i've won 18 club championships including this weekend. @mcuban swings like a little girl with no power or talent. mark's a loser 
@katysutherland6 great 
@johnbravo_1: @realdonaldtrump @kmac5911 @mcuban hey donald what's the best confidence builder? going against losers like mark cuban 
@byoppjr we just blew it up dummy

@kmac5911: who would win on the golf course @realdonaldtrump or @mcuban did you ever see mark swing a club the power of a little girl 
@cleggermeister thank you

@star13r: @realdonaldtrump what a show last night i couldn't believe the outcome c.a. has been my fave show for a long time great 

@owhiting147: @realdonaldtrump we know you hate mark cuban but what are your feelings on kevin o'leary? never heard of him 
apprentice ratings doing great easily won the 10 o'clock hour over other networks 
@thisnbagirl: @realdonaldtrump you are not as smart as mark cuban, no matter what you think. keep to what you know. lets do an i.q. test 
@n_vranas: @realdonaldtrump @dallasmavs @okcthunder ur a pussy trump @mcuban is way richer than you not even close, dummy 
@benjamin_abey: @realdonaldtrump @mcuban @dallasmavs so? what the fuck is your problem ? the people love him. nobody loves him 

@salesdan48: @realdonaldtrump mark will go down in history as a clownish buffoon. mark my words. i agree with you and a loser 
@lynchzc: @realdonaldtrump i think the real solution here is you running for president give it a shot we need it. thanks 
“leverage: don’t make deals without it.” – the art of the deal 
is anthony weiner also delusional? add him to ny sex offender list instead 
sexual pervert & deviant anthony weiner is polling to see if he can run for nyc mayor... 

.@dallasmavs is 1 12 against the western conference’s top four seeds after sunday’s loss & @okcthunder swept the season series. 
why does @mcuban continue to embarrass the 31 35 & 11th place @dallasmavs with childish behavior? really unprofessional 


the blue monster is being torn up at trump @doralresort. on april 1, i go out & play it one more time until the new course opens. 

.@dloesch played great audio from my @cpacnews press conference on her radio show. glad she made it 

scotland will be so lucky if this monstrosity is not built—i will tie them up in courts for years, if necessary. 
vattenfall ceo stated that the company needed to prepare itself for falling electricity demands in coming years a changing market. 
vattenfall, the company behind a proposed asinine windfarm off the coast of aberdeen, scotland, is having serious financial difficulty. 



if @omarosa is not in the board room, i can’t fire her. @latoyajackson made a strategic mistake. 



@kevin_johnson68 @trapasso2501 trump tower is open to the public. 




.@dennisrodman re @omarosa is right, she’s becoming predictable. 














@gaphotoman: @realdonaldtrump . if mr.trump would run he would be the best president ever thanks 
@simonkodousek: you may not agree with @realdonaldtrump, but he knows what's what keep being truthful and real thanks

@thesisko: @realdonaldtrump you have to run on 16. thanks 
@libertybellskp: @realdonaldtrump you were great and are great...keep on plugging away thank you 
thanks for all of the accolades on my speech today it's all about the truth 
honest reporters stated that the prayer breakfast was going on during my cpac speech and security was very slow to let people in long lines 
@orangeeffect01: @realdonaldtrump chris matthews is happily smearing you on hardball. poor chris i know chris well he is a lightweight. 
i agreed to take the worst spot at cpac because nobody else wanted it and it was the only time i could be there it was great fun 
why can't the media tell the truth we would all be so much better off

......@dailycaller, @breitbartnews, @drudge_report & @gatewaypundit. 
@jheil at @nymag is such a pathetic reporter who doesn’t want to know the truth. a total obama flunky & hack. 
boring & failing @nymag’s 3rd rate political reporter @jheil had flunky @danamira write a totally false report about me today...... 
..... he knows i don’t respect him. 

via gatewaypundit: “donald trump: “anthony weiner is a whack job pervert” (video)”http://bit.ly/yzbccg  


i watched the last two minutes of the @dallasmavs game last night i just loved watching them lose. 
press conference after cpac speech this morning was excellent lots of very professional reporters. 
the cpac speech went really well this morning first speaker standing ovation. i really enjoyed it. 
when you think big, you will automatically trigger more details because details are the major component of making anything big. 
in the general course of human nature, a power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power over his will. alexander hamilton 
.@mcuban has less tv persona than any other person i can think of. he’s an arrogant, crude, dope who met some very stupid people... 
...those stupid people bought @mcuban's company (of which he owned a piece). 
there’s a reason @mcuban’s partners can’t stand him and on top of that, the team sucks 

cpac attendees & fellow patriots lines for my @cpacnews start at 7:00am outside the potomac ballroom. make sure to get there early 
really big crowd expected tomorrow morning at # cpac2013. i look forward to it 
via @espn: @dallasmavs “most likely scenario remains finishing a frustrating ninth in the west”http://es.pn/9fewjz  
when @mcuban had his own show, the benefactor, it totally “bombed ” 
i love watching dummy @mcuban promote on ok show named shark tank—but he is just a small part of that show. 

good move by @msnbc in downgrading @wegoted to a dead weekend spot. this is truly a guy who shouldn't be on tv.

@heyavampirebat good idea i wish him luck. 
@vcross8 agreed, they're doing a great job.

let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate. john f. kennedy, inaugural address, january 1961 
the losing team is now back in boardroom. i can't discuss the team members or what's going on or what happens from here on out. 
re my hair should i change it? what do you think? 
it's true... dennis is really into this very animated. i have never seen him this way before. 
which team is your favorite? 
re omarosa: nasty, tough or smart...or all? 
does anyone agree with marilu that gary, while 'adorable', is a distraction? 
omarosa is very confident that the execs loved her concept & presentation. 
that's an interesting talent that marilu possesses 
next she says she's being set up by omarosa to fail....is somebody confused? 
what? latoya is saying omarosa is one of the nicest people she's met? 
on the whole, the teams seem to be working well together. no wars...yet. 
gary as the cat in the hat? he can work it out. 
what do you think of gary's definition of f u n? 
trace delivers check to hospital in nyc: american red cross must be grateful to trace and his team for their tremendous work. 
honest omarosa: she won't backstab she'll come at you from the front. 
which team do you think has the edge in this interactive photo experience task assignment? 
my 757 is incredible i think the teams agree on that. 
will team power be able to withstand omarosa as pm? smooth sailing is not expected. 
will plan b miss trace? 
firing bret was a tough one for me but omarosa doesn't seem to mind. 
omarosa always promises and delivers high drama... 
trace and his team raised an amazing amount of $. looks like a good season for charities. 
there's definitely no love lost between piers and omarosa. 
bret had a target on his back from the get go... 
that was some episode last week we've got a great cast 
i will be live tweeting during the @apprenticenbc tonight at 9pm et. 
i'm at trump doral right now, tiger will tee off shortly.

if mitch mcconnell wants to win his election, he’d better get rid of jinxed karl rove and fast...

how come nobody mentions that the nielsen ratings of the apprentice, after 12 seasons as shown by howard stern totally blow away...

@peace_janise: @realdonaldtrump i'll be watching break a leg thanks. 
i'll bet jimmy fallon gets great ratings tonight 
jimmy fallon show will be great tonight i'm on 
why does@ bill o'reilly keep putting karl rove on his show a total waste of time. rove spent $400, 000, 000 and didn't win a race pathetic 
on jimmy fallon tonight. 
dopey @billmaher still owes me $5m for charity. i hope he pays up before @hbo fires him which will happen 
@preewbrfu1 wind turbines are a disaster 
@bryantash thanks bryan. 
@lefteydowns @austinroneil great 

.@tedcruz must be doing something right if @cher, sadly rated “the 4th ugliest celebrity” according to @listverse, is attacking him. 
you have to feel bad for the democrat senators. they don’t want hagel either. just following obama’s orders. 
the ruling @gop consultant class of losers like @karlrove have no respect for the tea party. they do this at their own peril 
but why shouldn't i speak out? don't you speak out in this country? george steinbrenner 

just a few more days until the 13th season of all star @celebapprentice premieres. be sure to tune in this sunday at 9pm on @nbc. big 

@gjelajg be passionate about your work, focus, and never give up. 
country music star @traceadkins returns to all star @celebapprentice. competing for @redcross, trace is great 
i will be on @latenightjimmy tonight. always have a good time with @jimmyfallon. now we know he will get high ratings tonight. 
one of the reasons, i assume, i was inducted into the @wwe hall of fame is that vince mcmahon and i have the all time highest ratings... 
... and pay per view records with “battle of the billionaires” in detroit. it was a wild day 
it is a great honor for me to be inducted into the @wwe hall of fame. this will take place on april 6... 
... at madison square garden followed by a ceremony with 80,000 people at metlife stadium, wrestlemania. 
thanks go angelo, people are now really aware of my ties, shirts, and cuff links at macy's 
.....you keep forgetting to mention the fragrance, success 
a certain whack job, go angelo, who doesn't have a life spends his time hopelessly attacking me re: macy's.... 
..... i wonder if angelo has a job or is on assistance. in any event, i'm sure he is a nice guy 
when employees are working at home they can never have the same cohesivness as working together as a group... 
... also, if they’re at home who the hell knows what they’re doing (a second job maybe). 
now i know that yahoo is in good hands. it took great courage for @marissamayer to take away the right of employees to work at home.

our leaders are terrible. the government spends over $50b a day. it can’t find cuts for less than 2 days of spending? sad 
the countdown is on. the 13th season of all star @apprenticenbc premieres this sunday march 3rd at 9pm est on @nbc. big 
all star @apprenticenbc features the return of @latoyajackson. la toya is tough, smart and a super competitor. watch out 
the $85b sequester is just 2% of obama's $3.5t record deficit spending budget. our leaders are ruining our children's future. 

obama is making speeches excoriating the republicans, and they never answer back. why aren’t they fighting?

@jmarktiller thanks. 
@rpmnana thanks, good question/good point. 
@bethosborne14 thanks. 
@jurciuoli19 i will. 
@anchantra thanks the big question is why 
.@marissamayer is right to expect yahoo employees to come to the workplace vs. working at home. she is doing a great job 
an individual, whose whole career is trying to take down successful celebrities with nonsense campaigns, has turned his attention to me..... 
...so far, he has been a complete failure at doing so. he should read the art of the deal and use his energy to focus on a new career. 
the media is so in the tank for obama that it is amazing—the funny thing is, he can’t stand them 
speaker john boehner, who i like, should never have agreed to raise taxes because the republicans got absolutely nothing for it 
almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool... 
... icahn, kravis, apollo & most others—but nobody says they went bankrupt 
people buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals.. 
.... it is a very effective & commonly used business tool. 
@roxannequintana thanks roxanne. 
@dynomike3 hi mikey work hard and good luck. 
@jaderomaine thanks and good luck 
@agrclemsonfarmn thanks al. 
@jurciuoli19 very good 
whenever one of the morons say i wear a wig, stop reading because they have no credibility & just hate. 
why do losers & haters always say i wear a “wig” when they know i don’t. like it or not, it’s all mine—just ask barbara walters. 
how did you like michelle obama’s bangs last night? 
last night william shatner had more airtime than any winner. it should have been called the william shatner show...

come on goangelo, don't give up now just because your rally at macy's drew only eleven people for twenty minutes i love@ macy's. 
by popular demand, i will be tweeting on the very tainted academy awards tonight 
i'm saying that the tea party, perhaps by another name, will soon have another big moment and will be a major factor in victory 
why didn't movie lincoln use ford's theater for big scene instead of the stage of an unrelated theater? 
big response to my tea party statement remember they were never fully energized by romney campaign and will have far more power with time. 
republicans better start listening to and respecting the tea party

when will people realize that @billmaher is not an intellectual, but actually a rather dumb guy—just look at his past.

@kateywhitey i am right current tense. 
@scottjfata i like joe paterno and his family. 
@bcdorris @piersmorgan @apprenticenbc well, trace will now have a second chance. 
i went to wharton, made over $8 billion, employ thousands of people & get insulted by morons who can’t get enough of me on twitter... 
@pathselo good luck 
@traceybabe8 work hard and keep at it 
@carsenadeline yes, absolutely. there are always opportunities and therefore hope. good luck carsen 
@dougtammy14 thanks doug, skylar and tammy. 
check @billmaher’s background & you will find he is not a smart guy—he just wants people to think he is just call him dummy. 
i don’t know what will happen with the lawsuit against dummy @billmaher but have an obligation to charity to bring it. 
surprised @eagles signed michael vick yesterday to be their 2013 qb. vick is talented but brittle & probably won't last long.

have confidence, work hard, and keep your focus on the small things that matter while keeping the big picture in mind.

magician extraordinaire @pennjillette is back in the all star @apprenticenbc. this time he has even more tricks up his sleeve.

the new course at trump international scotland will be a par 72 layout, with five sets of tees ranging from 7,540 yards to 5,630. 
my doral country club purchase was made just before miami real estate market went through the roof—good timing 
sorry, but @piersmorgan is a good & smart man who is doing really well. that’s why he won @apprenticenbc. 
it’s okay but why do the haters (& losers) want to follow me on twitter?? get a life 



while in charlotte this weekend will visit my trump national golf club on lake norman—a magnificent place & doing really well 
going to charlotte, nc to speak before more than 20,000 people on saturday morning—total sellout crowd—will be great 

preview of obama’s sotu: more taxes, bigger government, shrink the private sector, end the republicans & bankrupt the country. enjoy 


what do you think of my suing @billmaher for $5m for charity? he made an offer, i accepted. 
can you imagine if @billmaher said about obama what he said about me (orangutan etc)—the press would run him out of the country... 
... but @billmaher is allowed to say that about me.

.@karlrove is far more to blame for obama's victory than the tea party. 






i don’t like bullies. i am not going to stand around and watch @karlrove target the tea party. karl rove gave us barack obama. loser. 

congratulations to my friend @roccomediate on winning the big golf tournament today 

.@billmaher's so called show on hbo must be the cheapest special produced in the history of television it sucks 
how does @hbo employ @billmaher with a pathetic show that he does what kind of a special is that? complete garbage

ashley judd targeted by @karlrove's super pac in ad (video)http://huff.to/tkxl0m  
.@karlrove’s ad is the best thing that ever happened to ashley judd—simply increases her profile. 
@karlrove is a total loser...save your money 
see the ashley judd ad by @karlrove and you will definitely vote for her and love obama. 
@karlrove ashley judd ad makes her and obama look great...nobody wastes money like karl rove 
is @karlrove incompetent? 400 million dollars down the drain and not 1 victory 
the dollar always talks in the end although our pols are killing the dollar

has pres. obama or the white house told the public what happened in algeria yet? where’s the media? 
the tea party delivered the house for @gop so they could be fiscally responsible. instead they have been irresponsible 
one positive from last week for lance was that everyone was focused on manti te'o why did lance do that interview? 

republicans are always worried about their general approval. with proposing to 'ignore the debt ceiling' they are ignoring their base. 
the worst negotiators in history (otherwise known as republicans) have just offered to suspend debt ceiling for four months. pathetic

@chididdy57 @lancearmstrong well, he's now paying a big price 
part of obama’s new found confidence is that the republicans aren’t using their power of ideas properly or effectively. 
obama’s speech indicates he wants to change this country as we know it wow, he really feels emboldened. 
if the republicans need a chief negotiator i am always available or can recommend some really good ones 
republicans, don’t extend the debt ceiling—make the great deal now 
the president’s speech was very combative toward republicans—they have obviously not earned his respect

.@deadspin will never make it—they don’t understand graciousness or money—and best guy is leaving? 
dummies @deadspin had their big payday taken from them by others in the media. 
.@deadspin guys are total losers—they had their story stolen right from under their bad complexions—other media capitalized 
alabama people are saying their team has real football & real girlfriends—not good for notre dame—but they’ll be back 
i still say te'o did this in order to get sympathy for the heisman vote—thankfully he did not win. 
te’o’s imaginary girlfriend is one of the great cons of all time—or he’s very stupid. 
the interview was great for @oprah and terrible for lance armstrong 
.@oprah was great amazing that she got lance armstrong to totally destroy his life. why did he ever do that interview? 
lance armstrong did himself great harm last night. lawsuits & failure will follow him 
@tman99us @_katherinewebb that's shaquille o'neal's shoe. 



all time hit leader pete rose should now be in the baseball hall of fame. he has paid his penalty 
.@boeing stock went way down because of 787 so i just bought stock in @boeing great company 
the interview with oprah will cause lance armstrong huge legal and financial problems sometimes it is better to go into a corner and hide. 
i'll bet lance armstrong wishes he didn't do the interview with oprah he's saying to himself what was i thinking? 
.@hbo should fire @billmaher and bring back @dennisdmz someone that is actually funny. 
.@billmaher’s show is great for helping me get to sleep better than sominex. 
.@billmaher needs to cut back on the pot, and maybe he will stop making offers he can’t afford. 
dumbass @billmaher has still not given me the 5 million he committed to charity we just presented him with a demand notice. 
brent musburger did himself a great favor by saying what everyone was thinking he is much more popular now than before. 
.@espn’s apology(brent musburger) was a disgrace to broadcasting stop being so politically correct 
imo manti te’o was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the heisman trophy. 
can it just be new age that manti te’o fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax? 
not believable that manti te’o was in love for one year with a girl he never met she then died. he is either very stupid.... 
...or mentally troubled (or a con). 
congratulations to tom scocca and timothy burke of @deadspin for exposing the manti te’o fiasco. 

look, i have always liked lance armstrong i just hated what he did to himself, including recently. his life will now be hell. 
lance armstrong made a really big mistake by opening up to oprah. i’ll bet he wishes he had the chance to do it over again. 
lance armstrong was given very,very bad advice 
journal news readership is already down 50 percent over the years. 
if everybody sued the journal news for revealing their info (guns) paper would go out of business.

we were led to believe that jeep would manufacture in u.s. and sell to china—like china does to us. 
unlike u.s., china taxes things made in the u.s. and sold in china. china demands plants, we don’t. stupid

i am a handwriting analyst. jack lew’s handwriting shows, while strange, that he is very secretive—not necessarily a bad thing.

i hope the republicans are happy. just as i predicted, that stupid deal they voted for only whetted obama’s appetite for more taxes.

this ‘deal’ @rnc voted for has $41 in tax increases for every $1 in spending cuts. it is pathetic. obama is laughing at them. 
make sure you realize that this ‘deal’ is only a stop gap measure.obama will be looking to raise even more taxes in the coming negotiation.. 
...remember i told you so. 
obama's deal raises taxes on 77% of national households. with obama care taxes kicking in now, everyone will be paying for his 2nd term.

we are way over the fiscal cliff. and with obama care being fully implemented in less than 14 months, it may be too late. 
alex rodriguez has played under 140 games in each of the last five seasons. he will miss half of next season. really bad deal for @yankees. 
dopey @lord_sugar—look in the mirror and thank the real lord that donald trump exists. you are nothing 
@piersmorgan @lord_sugar i easily could but as long as sugar is making me money (it's my show) i won't unlike sugar, i'm not stupid 

... and many others. drop to your knees, sugar, and say thank you, mr. trump. 
sugar: @lord_sugar keep working hard so i make plenty of $ with your show... 
...you have little persona, but the apprentice concept is great and lucky for you 
sugar: @lord_sugar—unlike you, i own the apprentice. you were never successful enough... 
.... to do the apprentice but i approved you anyway. without my show you’d be nothing 
.@lord_sugar if you think ugly windmills are good for scotland you are an even worse businessman than i thought... 
... and, in my opinion, should not be doing the apprentice.

.@antbaxter—your documentary works better than any sleeping pill—in fact that may be your only way to make money with this recycled garbage 
why do so many people say i hate president obama—i don’t hate the president at all. i just disagree with his policies 
@antbaxter @salon @antbaxter—apprentice is a huge hit all over the world. your cheap & boring documentary is a tremendous flop. 
9 million fewer people voted for obama this election than last & yet the republicans lost—do you think they might be doing something wrong 
i got to know @johnboehner very well—he is a great guy who will do the right thing for the country 
i received such a nice letter today from someone who took refuge in trump tower during sandy. it was my pleasure to help. 
robert pattinson is putting on a good face for the release of twilight. he took my advice on kristen stewart...i hope 
the election was a major setback for economy. all young entrepreneurs should be sure to calculate obama's policies into their investments. 
of the 9 battleground states, we only carried north carolina. i'm proud of @ncgop & glad i delivered keynote at their state convention. 
remember to watch the series finale of the men who built america this sunday at 8/7c on @history 
polls show that the hurricane had a huge positive effect for obama on his win isn't that ridiculous? 
romney campaign used me in 6 primary states and won every one they should have used me in florida and ohio & he would be president. 
remember to watch the series finale of the men who built america this sunday at 8/7c on @history 


china's communist party has now publicly praised obama's reelection. they have never had it so good. will own america soon. 
at the end of the day, obama won the battleground states by less than 500,000 votes. this was a winnable race. gop needs to do better 
with taxes set to go up and obama about to cut the mortgage deduction, now is the time to buy a house if you can. can get a great deal. 
.@davidaxelrod i'm sending you a check to help find a cure. @ivankatrump says hi. 
no surprise that all the foreign countries are celebrating obama's win. they love a weak america that they can rip off. 

i will and i agree rt @zacharyquinto @realdonaldtrump you can't possibly make any more money. so why don't you make a difference instead? 
i started to get very worried about mitt's chances when i heard that a rod donated to his campaign. everything a rod touches turns bad. 
russian leaders are publicly celebrating obama's reelection. they can't wait to see how flexible obama will be now.

the stock market and us dollar are both plunging today. welcome to @barackobama’s second term. 
congrats to @karlrove on blowing $400 million this cycle. every race @crossroadsgps ran ads in, the republicans lost. what a waste of money. 
millions without electricity across ny & nj. the media has covered for obama’s massive failure. can you imagine if this was another pres? 
pervert alert. @repweiner is back on twitter. all girls under the age of 18, block him immediately. 

it's freezing and snowing in new york we need global warming 
we have to make america great again 
our country is totally split right now but someday it will come together

this was the republicans election to win but they just blew it reasons why to follow. 
brian, if i'm well past the last exit to relevance how come you spent so much time reading my tweets last night? @nbcnightlynews 
brian williams was never a smart guy but always passes himself off as such. people will learn the truth @nbcnightlynews 
brian, i hope @nbcnightlynews isn't paying you too much look at what's happening to nightly news. 
brian thanks dummy i picked up 70,000 twitter followers yesterday alone. cable news just passed you in the ratings. @nbcnightlynews 
the voting booth process was a total disaster—it could and should be much better and more efficient—tremendous room for error 
this was the republicans election to win. @mittromney is a good man but he just never connected with the people. 
.@bwilliams wouldn't you love to have my ratings? 
the only thing more boring than @bwilliams newscast is his show rock center which is totally dying in the ratings—a disaster 
.@bwilliams knows that i think his newscast has become totally boring so he took a shot at me last night. 



house of representatives shouldn't give anything to obama unless he terminates obamacare. 
hopefully the house of representatives can hold our country together for four more years...stay strong and never give up 
the electoral college is a disaster for a democracy. 
our nation is a once great nation divided 
our country is now in serious and unprecedented trouble...like never before. 
this election is a total sham and a travesty. we are not a democracy 
lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice the world is laughing at us. 
we can't let this happen. we should march on washington and stop this travesty. our nation is totally divided 
well, back to the drawing board

@tappersong thanks gary. 
obama thinks he can just laugh off the fact that he refuses to release his records to the american public. he can't. 

if you experience any harassment or heckling at the polling places from obama supporters, make sure you report it immediately. 

yesterday obama campaigned with jayz & springsteen while hurricane sandy victims across ny & nj are still decimated by sandy. wrong 
make sure to verify the voting machine does not switch your vote. if you have any problems, notify the poll workers.

@jtylerdowling thanks 
@spencerljackson yes 
remember: obama turned down $5m to charity which i said i would increase by 10x to $50m just to show simple records. he's hiding lots 
if you voted for obama in 2008 to prove you were not a racist then vote for romney in 2012 to prove you are not stupid. thanks walter d 

despite the upcoming election, the cover of paper thin time magazine looks like an ad for the movie lincoln sad 
before you vote, think: obama wants to raise taxes, @mittromney wants to lower taxes need i say more 
why is obama playing basketball today? that is why our country is in trouble 
i was invited to be with mitt romney tonight win, lose, or draw, i’ll be there 
answer to your questions i will be voting at 10:30 am at lighthouse international 110 east 60th street, manhattan 
go out and vote this will be the most important election of our time 

benghazi is bigger than watergate. don’t let obama get away with allowing americans to die. kick him out of office tomorrow. 
the outer boroughs of manhattan are still devasted by sandy. how would the press cover this if a republican was president. 
china is worried. the polls are trending for @mittromney. they won’t be able to steal from us anymore. 
.@abfalecbaldwin p.s. your brother @stephenbaldwin7 is doing very well on @apprenticenbc and he stated he adores you.

@mcuban do you mean the president's birthplace? 
.@mcuban letterman @late_show had his best ratings with me and you bombed. people don't care about mark cuban. 
after 13 seasons, @apprenticenbc easily beat shark tank in ratings last year better demos as well. 
.@mcuban, shark tank was shoved to friday evening friday is considered “dead television.” besides, you are not the star (& never will be). 
obama just stated it's always good to ignore donald trump. i state he is right, especially when the truth is against him. 
.@mcuban baseball commissioner and owners were smart when they didn’t want you to buy a team but i don’t think you have the money anyway.

@conedison, call gm dan scavino at 914 944 0900. 
like @conedison, obama is incompetent 
@conedison is incompetent and will have tremendous liability to briarcliff manor and trump national 
@conedison doesn't even respond to the people in briarcliff...like a forgotten area. 
@conedison is terrible...don't know what they are doing. trump national briarcliff and all houses are totally blacked out 
@mittromney will turn this mess around 
make sure you get out and vote...most important election of our generation...go romney 
trump hotels are delivering lots of food to storm victims...we love doing it 
gary johnson is asking people to waste their vote on him. make it count vote for @mittromney. 
we don’t want to have a recount in any of the battleground states. obama will steal it. make sure all your friends and family vote. 
obama's war on women has lead to the biggest decline in female employment in 40 years. 4 more years?? 
undecideds in oh,pa and wi will make the difference. all should ask themselves if they want $6/gallon gas because it will come under obama. 
pennsylvania is in play @mittromney. all undecideds in philly suburbs should ask themselves who do you trust most on @israel? 
i think @thereval should take this challenge. axelrod was too scared. rt: @ronkaufmanintrn: kaufstache vs. sharpstache. 

considering obama hasn’t proposed anything concrete, if he wins he won’t have a mandate. another 4 years of legislative stalemate. 


castro, chavez and ahmadinejad are all anxiously awaiting our election results. they are praying obama wins. 
obama promised 5.2% unemployment by october 2012. his promises are worthless 
go as far as you can see; when you get there, you'll be able to see farther. j.p. morgan 
make sure to catch @history’s season finale of “the men who built america” on sun, november 11th. great show. 

could be the hurricane helps @mittromney people are rioting in the streets over gasoline 

global warming is based on faulty science and manipulated data which is proven by the emails that were leakedhttp://onforb.es/rdpygo  
obama has destroyed the middle class. in ’09, median household income was $55,198. now it is $50,678. four more years? 
i have an idea for a rod buy a home at @trumpgolfla overlooking the pacific will bring you better luck. 
a rod is now looking for an expensive home in beverly hills why aren't the @yankees terminating his contract for misrepresentation? 
.@eagles should sit michael vick. he is a great athlete but less than average quarterback. 

we don't need a secretary of business to understand business, we need a president who understands business and i do @mittromney 
unemployment is now 7.9%. four years and $6.5t later, that is really bad 
@simonsam it is trump water thanks. 
how about president obama fixing the gasoline situation instead of taking photo ops in the destruction. 
.@maggiepolitico is an unprofessional hack who belongs @politico with all the other obama hacks. 

interestingly, the hurricane may now be a disaster for obama's reelection because of his grandstanding. 
people are struggling to get gasoline for their cars we are like a third world country. 
i'm sending lots of bottled water out to staten island & long island. 
.@thereval came to my trump tower office to apologize for calling me a racist very nice, apology accepted 
.@barbarajwalters called my office to ask me to do election night coverage with her sadly, i won't be able to do it. 
.@ralphgilles of chrysler should focus on design rather than filthy language not very professional. 
we should not allow @chrysler to move @jeep jobs to china after they said they wouldn't stay tuned 
.@chrysler disputes my statement but watch chrysler move @jeep jobs to china after the election. 
with long gas lines & total disarray from storm, the hurricane may yet be a negative for obama. 
it was announced this morning that unemployment rose this can't be good for obama. 
next year i will be changing the name of 800 acre doral to trump national doral. it will be the best resort in the country—miami is hot 
i will start reviewing various political reporters etc & websites as to their professionalism & fairness—many people asking for this. 
how could obama leave those american heroes out to die in benghazi? and he continues to lie to the public 
what is your thought as to why obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications? 
nice to see obama released a situation room photo from sandy. how about releasing the photo taken during benghazi? 
everybody knows why obama would not show his college applications they are just not willing to say 
if i would have offered obama a billion dollars to show his records, he would have refused. 
my video response to president obama's lack of transparency.http://youtu.be/tygw3_w3ts8?hd=1 … 

i will soon be releasing my response to the fact that president obama refused to show his applications and records to the public. 
president obama missed the deadline 
obama is a terrible negotiator. he bails out chrysler and now chrysler wants to send all jeep manufacturing to china and will 
why is obama’s auto bailout now creating jobs in china? he is ruining american industry. 
to all @mittromney supporters, make sure you have taken advantage of early voting now so you can gotv on election day. 

you know the world is crazy when new york gets hit by a hurricane and florida doesn't. 
let's continue to destroy the competitiveness of our factories & manufacturing so we can fight mythical global warming. china is so happy 
do you believe @algore is blaming global warming for the hurricane? 
from 1954 to 1960 there were 10 major hurricanes that hit the east coast. 
it's 10 am: two hours to go for obama to easily pick up millions for charity 
the successful man will profit from his mistakes and try again in a different way. dale carnegie 
@stass13 thanks 
obama is now standing in a puddle acting like a president give me a break. 
a lot of people are concerned about which charity my $5m will be donated to. the onus is on obama to first release his records. 
president obama, if it is important to you, i will substantially increase the $5m offer 
president obama, please take the $5m check for charity tomorrow. it is so easy and could do so much good 

congratulations to @mittromney on getting the @dmregister, @newyorkpost, @newyorkobserver & @nashuatelegraph endorsements 
spoiler @dennisrodman has really got his act together so far on the upcoming season of @celebapprentice... 

how does a dummy like @billmaher get a television show & his ratings stink. you'd think @hbo could do a lot better. 
a lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with obama’s lack of transparency. i don't blame them. 
there is nothing i would be happier to do than to donate the $5m to a charity of obama’s choice, once he releases all of his records. 

.@disney's acquisition of lucas film is a smart deal for both sides. disney just bought a great brand which will keep producing revenue. 
in the spirit of transparency, obama should immediately release the 9.11 tape of tyrone woods pleading for military support in benghazi. 
today barack obama is standing in water in nj. remember on election day that he has put the us underwater. 
how many illegal foreign donations will obama collect this final week? another scandal ignored by the liberal media.http://bit.ly/rpmehp

.@oreillyfactor called me a master marketeer last night i am not. i am a great builder i build great things & people come. 


kevin garnett's response to ray allen last night was that of a great competitor nothing wrong in fact it was terrific. a champion 
i was standing with @shaq when a young high school star, kevin garnett @celtics, said to a crowd forget shaq, i want to meet donald trump. 

i'm not hearing much from obama or his administration about my $5m offer to charity or to which charity the money will go. 
the president has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5m for his favorite charity. looking like he won't be doing it. what is he hiding? 

the polls & momentum are trending towards @mittromney. don't let the hurricane change your thinking 
fans shouldn't worry. we have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of @celebapprentice appropriately due to the storm. 

maybe obama should donate my $5m to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm? 
scary. obama and the democrat senate have accrued over $5t worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years. 4 more years? 

why does obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? hiding something? 
@digiphile @redcross rt if you think pres.obama should release his records to get $5m for charity for red cross or another great charity 
glad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co hosting the grammy nominations special on 12.5. taylor is terrific 
let’s be honest, if obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm, then he would have been in ohio on monday. 
how did obama go to a las vegas fundraiser on 9.12, the day after he refused to send help to americans in benghazi? 
without focus, it's just impossible to be successful at anything. midas touch 
i never fall for scams. i am the only person who immediately walked out of my ‘ali g’ interview 
another great cause obama could send my $5m donation to is a charity for 9/11 first responders. they are american heroes. 
my @squawkcnbc interview discussing the 57th st. crane, damage from the storm and extending my $5m offer to obamahttp://bit.ly/udxtrb  

these last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% gdp. obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in american history. 
the election is trending towards @mittromney. americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the obama economic decline. 

the trump tower atrium is such a great place & kept thousands of people warm & safe during the storm thanks, staff 
.@matthewlumby charity should get the money 
@neilmsdunn dopey, few have built more than me. 
remember this: obama wants to raise taxes, @mittromney wants to lower taxes need i say more 
don't let obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states. 

i am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap, i would have been lambasted from coast to coast. 
because of the hurricane, i am extending my 5 million dollar offer for president obama's favorite charity until 12pm on thursday. 
not only giving out money, but obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real president don't fall for it. 
hurricane is good luck for obama again he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars. 
i saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm. 
the water damage to nyc is amazing. the winds were bad but the water was worse. 
all weights are on crane's wrong side very precarious below, move out 
if authorities need direct view from top of trump tower, call office. 

we are taking care of hundreds of people in the trump tower atrium they are seeking refuge. free coffee and food. 
so far the hurricane is being handled very well in ny, not nearly as bad as stated on news. let's see what happens later. 
many people walked out on madonna's concert when she told them to vote for obama. years ago i walked out because the concert was terrible 

obama lied 100% about libya and the killings emails are absolute. he must release his records on wednesday and stop the lies. 
dave letterman @late_show said during my interview that obama was probably born in the us the word probably is a disaster for obama. 
i'm not hearing much from obama or his administration about my $5m offer to charity or to which charity the money will go. 


i guess @billmaher saw my ratings on the @late_show the other night where letterman beat leno. bill, you are no letterman. 
while @bettemidler is an extremely unattractive woman, i refuse to say that because i always insist on being politically correct. 
.@bettemidler talks about my hair but i'm not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body so i won't. is this a double standard? 
but whenever she sees me, she kisses my ass. she's disgusting. @bettemidler 
i never liked @bettemidler's persona or singing and haven't heard her name in years. 
now grotesque @bettemidler is into the trump act trying to become relevant again. 
many people are saying that my challenge to obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers i agree. 
a lot changed when david letterman said he was probably born in this country the word probably is a total disaster for obama. 

i defended @starjonesesq when she lied about her stomach operation to lose weight only to get blindsided by her on the @todayshow. 

i am going to the @nyjets game with @woodyjohnson4, the owner of the team, a great guy. 
@johnsununu is taking major heat for calling the president lazy. but the president stated his weakness is that he is lazy. fight on john 
@bernardmcguirk. that's more than o'reilly did ...and he is supposed to be my friend. you're terrific 
@bernard mcguirk thanks for being so nice and defending me on o'reilly...you're terrific 
alert...the president knew that the ambassador was being attacked in benghazi. he did nothing...he is no leader. 
@donnydeutsch tries so hard to be a star. but, he just doesn't have what it takes...and he never will. 
i put @donnydeutsch on apprentice at his request, i did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my obama announcement. 
i want to end the day by saying there is no check i would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our president. 
the today show should call me about who to put on the show— i know more about people who get ratings than anyone. 

i hear they are very unhappy w/ arianna and @huffingtonpost at @aol. i’ll bet she won’t be there for long 


if obama doesn't accept my offer to be fully transparent, what will he say? 
if my offer is refused, every undecided oh voter will be fully aware that obama denied $5m to charity all because he is hiding something 
barack obama has everything to gain. why would anyone ever deny $5m to charity? 



i have decided to add a caveat to my offer. obama can't decide to send my $5m to rev. wright if he releases his records. 
my fellow tea party friends in ohio make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can gotv election day. know you can must win ohio. 
where's the transparency? despite obama's denial @sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with jeremiah wright. 

pretty audacious for obama to call @mittromney a bser when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write. 
by the way, where is @oprah? good question. 4 years ago she strongly supported obama now she is silent. anyway, who cares, i adore oprah. 
...colin powell thought iraq has weapons of mass destruction. 
obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. the middle east is a mess. yet colin powell still endorses him. wonder why? 
be careful of an obama bomb to win election would be a horrible thing to do. 
the election is still close but trending toward @mittromney. he leads all national polls and obama's likeability is imploding. vote 
wow letterman show @late_show won the ratings last night big time and guess who was his guest? djt 



@crushthespirit true 
what a dumb mistake aol made buying the @huffingtonpost. how much longer will arianna last i predict not much. 
@mikempef thanks, i hope you enjoyed it, had a great time. 
@destiny_113 @stephenathome i agree. 
@maureenperonne @late_show thanks, it was a great show.. 
@mrjmf1 @late_show thanks i will. 
stupid arianna @huffingtonpost hired the man who ruined the once great nytimes business section... 
...a real loser named tim o'brien and it's never recovered. 
dopey arianna @huffingtonpost is really after me boring story after boring story...but i hear she is in big trouble 
i knew last year that @time magazine lost all credibility when they didn't include me in their top 100... 
... i will soon start naming magazines that i think will fold i predicted newsweek. 
@yewkalaylee great idea. 
@seketa77 i hope so for the charity's sake 
@tylarreese thanks tylar 

@lianneonlife i love the wounded warriors obama should choose that as his $5m charity. 
@ryanseven sounds like a good idea. 
@erizzle05 only because he has something to hide. 
.@sabrinasiddiqui re: taylor and conor great news for taylor 
based on the ovation last night from the letterman @late_show audience, i believe it will be hard for obama to throw $5m down the drain.... 
....instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause. 
another great charity that the $5m could go to just a recommendation to the pres. the wounded warriors represented so well by @traceadkins 
lots of response that obama should give the $5m to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in benghazi. 
letterman @late_show was great last night. i had a lot of fun. you could see his audience really wanted obama to take the $ for charity. 
the dealmaker is cunning, secretive, focused and never settles for less than he wants. the america we deserve 
it is really a shame that barack obama may stop $5m from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent. 
doing david letterman @late_show tonight at 11:30. 1st nite of sweeps.going into the lion's den but i've been there many times before. enjoy 
six days and counting until my offer to barack obama expires... 
for someone who demanded 20 years of mitt's tax returns, you would think my offer to donate $5m to charity for his records is an easy go. 


i hope derek jeter’s recovery is going well. he is a very special player and a great guy. new york loves him. @yankees 

@politico has really become a laughing stock of good political reporting. 
what will be the response on wednesday? if obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity. 
@michellemalkin i fully supported mccain but when he lost, hoped obama would be great for u.s. he wasn't. 
.@mark_sanchez shouldn’t be too upset over @evalongoria. he will always do great 
i am offering the chance for barack obama to redistribute $5m to any charity of his choice. everyone wins. take the deal. 
“our side needs donald trump.” @anncoulter on @seanhannity’s show last night. thanks ann. 
.@barbarajwalters @theviewtv why did you choose me as one of the 10 most fascinating people of the year last season (and more than once?) 
.@barbarajwalters @theviewtv will apologize to me just like she did when i was right about @rosie. besides, i get great ratings on the view. 
.@barbarajwalters @theviewtv barbara, unfortunately you've missed the entire point of my announcement you just don't get it 
still waiting for an explanation about why @giulianarancic & @billrancic did not name their son donald. unbelievable. 
miss universe 2012 pageant will be airing live on @nbc & @telemundo december 19th. open invite stands for robert pattinson. 
excited to announce that @giulianarancic & @bravoandy will be hosting the 2012 miss universe pageant. great ratings for miss universe. 
how does @michellemalkin get a conservative platform? she is a dummy just look at her past. 
the @dailybeast will die just like newsweek same management. 
the fact that we still don't know these things about barack obama is the point. @monicacrowley on @seanhannity's show last night. 


my @gretawire interview discussing my $5m charitable offer to obama, his lack of transparency & my tremendous supporthttp://bit.ly/tbj2ar  



just stated by a total pro: you are the only one who has the guts to say what we are all thinking. 
glad to hear north carolina is solid for @mittromney. it started trending for mitt solidly after my speech at the @ncgop convention. 
in light the benghazi emails released last night, it is apparent that obama has no problem lying to the american public... 
... by releasing his records, he can come clean with the american people and have $5 million go to a charity. 
obama has no problem leaking national security secrets. why can't he release his records? especially when $5m is going to charity. 
i am happy to donate $5 million to a charity barack obama chooses. all i am asking is that he is transparent with the american people 

i just learned that @politico has no credibility total phonies that don't report the truth. a puppet of obama? 
glad to hear @seanhannity supports my offer to obama. as sean says “it is an easy $5 million to charity. what does obama have to lose?” 
third rate @politico took every negative tweet or response they could find & put it out when in fact the response is incredibly positive. 
my offer to obama is about transparency. in 2008, american people were sold on hope and change. this our last chance to get the full record. 
rt @reuterspolitics: trump to give $5 million to charity if obama releases recordshttp://reut.rs/p2jjaw  

the response has been fantastic actually overwhelming thank you 

you have all been waiting the response has been amazing watch my announcement now, press release to follow at 12:15.http://bitly.com/sivjcv  
all predictions re: my 12 o'clock release are totally incorrect. stay tuned 
story will be released today at 12 noon est on twitter and facebook. 
invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the attack. sun tzu 


if you like having the world collapse and being told america is leading from behind vote obama. 
no wonder @bbc is in such big trouble & boss was just fired they are lost. 
.@bbc should never have played that piece of garbage documentary & yet the phones are ringing off the hook to play the course. 
...that it was hard not to end up rooting for trump... 
thank you to @dailytelegraph reviewer @neilmidgley who stated 'you've been trumped' was so biased in favour of the protesters... 
.@bobschieffer did an excellent job as debate moderator last night. i only wish mitt was more aggressive 
everyone is asking me to speak more on robert & kristen.i don't have time except to say robert, drop her, she cheated on you & will again 
last night was the first time obama said we instead of i in respect to bin laden's killing. 
barack obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after bin laden now he wants all of the credit 
my announcement is tomorrow 
tomorrow i will be tweeting on only one subject 
china will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own 
mitt romney must start congratulating the navy seals and military on bin laden’s killing, not the president. 
.@mittromney should have been more aggressive last night. yet some polls have him winning the debate. 
my @squawkcnbc interview discussing last night’s presidential debate, my stock picks and tomorrow’s big announcementhttp://bit.ly/uwpbom  

when the military informed obama that they had bin laden, is there anyone with a brain that would not have said ok, go get him ? 

lance armstrong fought for 7 years & then just ran out of energy. very sad story although they caught him red handed.he definitely cheated 
casting sometimes is fate and destiny more than skill and talent, from a director's point of view. steven spielberg 
no matter what happens in the election, @davidaxelrod deserves a lot of credit. he has kept obama in it, even with his terrible record. 
i always said that @lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges. by stopping, he gave his enemies an opening. 

the debate was pretty even but i thought mitt should have been much more aggressive on obama's failed foreign policy and i mean much more. 
debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. viewership will be way down. 
i will be doing @squawkcnbc at 7:30. 

.@mittromney looks much calmer, and obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward. 
bob schieffer will do a great job tonight. always treated me fairly. 
well this is it, the final debate let's see how it goes. i'll be tweeting live. 
i have watched @linda_mcmahon for years she will bring jobs & business back to connecticut incredible woman 
my good friends in connecticut have a great opportunity to send an amazing businesswoman to washington. vote for @linda_mcmahon for senate 

@brandonthrill thanks a great compliment. 
@trottofficial thanks and doing great business from all over the world. 
why don't we ask the navy seals who killed bin laden? they don't seem to be happy with obama claiming credit. all he did is say o.k. 

i look forward to @mittromney hitting obama hard tonight for lying about benghazi. cia told obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs. 
everybody is asking about my announcement this wednesday concerning barack obama just wait and see 
.@bobschieffer will a great job tonight he is a real pro and respected by both sides. 

everyone knows i am right that robert pattinson should dump kristen stewart. in a couple of years, he will thank me. be smart, robert. 
obama is an easy target on foreign policy.@mittromney has many openings to attack, especially when obama starts bragging about bin laden. 
this is my last election. after my election i have more flexibility. obama to @medvedevrussiae discussing our nuclear arsenal. 

obama planted that @nytimes story on iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate. he wants libya and china off the table. 

@larrylivermore @tufnrs73 dopey, i never went bankrupt. 
@dukepga ken thanks i am proud of you. great job on tour this year i always knew. 
@patti0713 thanks 
@yea4country @politico thanks it needs a lot of work. 
@austinmay austin thanks 

...now @alexsalmond doesn't like me who cares 

the @bbc is widely criticized for a lack of professionalism. we dealt with a roger mosey a total lightweight who doesn't have a clue. 
.@toure i felt very sorry for you during your meltdown on @piersmorgan. he drove you insane but, of course, piers is a lot smarter than you 
the @bbc is in total disarray. i know personally how bad they are pathetic.http://nyti.ms/rdyusx  
my son don and his wife vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named spencer frederick very thrilling. 
@kennedy_mac dopey, i never went bankrupt 

last week i had @sinow's tweet of the week and the most retweeted @mittromney mention twice . can anyone else top that? don't think so 
had a great time watching the @nyjets @patriots game yesterday at gillette stadium. great and exciting game. 

i wish tonight's debate would cover more than foreign policy. 

don't let obama play the iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected be careful republicans 
.@toure, when you are fired from msnbc for your bad ratings and racist coverage, stop by and say hello. 
autism rates through the roof why doesn't the obama administration do something about doctor inflicted autism. we lose nothing to try. 
we should march on washington re:autism with leadership & common sense the numbers would drop precipitously 
lots of autism and vaccine response. stop these massive doses immediately. go back to single, spread out shots what do we have to lose. 

new hampshire is a critical state for both candidates this year. i got to know new hampshire and love it. 


my @foxandfriends interview discussing lance armstrong losing his titles, obama's foreign policy & my big announcementhttp://bit.ly/qn26mw  
stay tuned for my big obama announcement probably on wednesday.  
people are going crazy with my comments on diet coke (soda). let's face it this stuff just doesn't work. it makes you hungry. 
the anti wind turbine movement in scotland against @alexsalmond is amazing keep going scots, save your country 
obama should stop talking about wind turbines they are a disaster for a country or community & are very expensive & unreliable. 
i will be live tweeting during the debate tonight. 
derek, get well soon, the @yankees need youl. 
gas prices are at crazy levels fire obama 
sleepy eyes @chucktodd owes @jack_welch an apology. jack is right on unemployment the new jobless claims make 7.8% an impossibility. 
they succeed, because they think they can. virgil 
don butler and executives are doing a great job at @cadillac the cars are fantastic. 
the biggest problem with a rod is he is bad for the chemistry of the yankees he must go. 
fort hood shooting should be declared a terror attack. respect the wounded and dead. 
good luck to derek on his operation. i know it will be a success he is a great champion. 
derek must move back into one of my buildings immediately. it will be lucky for him like in past. 
derek jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in trump world tower. 
7.8% unemployment number is a complete fraud as evidenced by the jobless claims number released yesterday.real unemployment is at least 15% 
.@mittromney's @rnc convention came in over $3m under budget. barack’s @dnc convention is over $10m in debt. what a surprise 

can't wait for @vanityfair to fold which, under graydon carter, will be sooner rather than later. 
.@vanityfair's terrible piece on mitt's faith is a new low, even for them. 
where were all the @vanityfair exposes on when rev. wright disciples go to washington? sad 

rev. @billygraham is a great man and so is his son, franklin graham. 
rev.@billygraham is doing tremendous work this election cycle educating the christian community on @mittromney. 
both barack and @mittromney were excellent at the al smith dinner last night 
a lot of the @yankees should be ashamed of their play in the post season. they are lucky they don't have to deal with george steinbrenner. 
i hope @boyscouts of america handle their problems a lot better than the board at penn state did. you can't do any worse 
@rginn_1 toledo is a great place i've been there & worked in cincinnati for 2 years i love ohio. 
@rickythebitch @ladygaga i think gaga is great her 1st major appearance at my miss universe pageant in vietnam/6 yrs ago should give me 25% 
newly released nh poll has @mittromney with a 1 point lead. mitt will pull away next week. 
obama has called libya attack a bump in the road and not optimal. just come clean already tell americans the truth 
maybe derek jeter should ask a rod about renting his apartment next year. very soon a rod won't need a place in nyc. 
yes i will be live tweeting during the final debate this coming monday.

@d_hastie @lancearmstrong no, i said u.s. destroyed a once american icon 


.@lancearmstrong really blew it went down in flames too bad 

why would ohio listen to bruce springsteen reading his lines? be careful or i will go to ohio and @mittromney will win it 
@jakfrombk thanks 
@misterjoe49 @yankees i agree, but their careers weren't fueled by drugs. 
obama said not optimal to ambassador & embassy killings bad word usage for a harvard graduate. 

@evaemery never give up. you have what it takes. 
great decision by donald graham @newsweek to sell. i'll now have to take my newsweek covers off the wall. 
with barry diller & tina brown in charge, did anyone doubt that @newsweek would be a massive failure? 

something really bad happened to the @yankees psyche much like our president

@calumspence greatly appreciated, thanks. 
@morali_arch great to meet you also. 
@neanderthalman1 @mittromney i was referring, of course, to bill clinton's statement on the economy. 
@crazymom28 i have a friend that wants to meet your sister. 

the last time i visited china i couldn't believe all the construction. you can go up with a project in a week no red tape. 
it's thursday. how much money did barack obama waste today on crony green energy projects? 
clinton commented in ohio today that @mittromney is right, the economy has not been fixed under obama.i always said bill was an honest man. 
when strasburg leaves @nationals for another team for more money, will washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good? 
bad sign for obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states. their internals must be horrendous. 
while the next season of @celebapprentice is packed w/ all stars, ours fans will be happy to see @joan_rivers in the board room.she is back 
derek jeter @yankees wants to rent an apartment. derek only in a trump building trump is lucky for you. 
now there is talk of a rod being shipped to @marlins. if a rod is not a @yankee next year, the fans will be happy. 
i think the @yankees will win today. unlike a rod, cc is good under pressure. i hope a rod plays, however. 
@nickj102 @antbaxter i don't want to fall asleep in public. 
robert i'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump kristen but i'm right. if you saw the miss universe girls you would reconsider.

looking forward to honoring the great dogan family & the success of the trump towers project in istanbul @followturkey annual gala dinner 
alert us jobless claims up 46,000 to 388,000. really bad news. 7.8% is now a fraud not possible 
amazing my tweets are covered across every spectrum from @espn to @politico to @wsj. 
when we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $5 trillion of deficits over the last four years. @mittromney 
obama's spending and borrowing is burying america and destroying our children's future. does he even care? 


.@ashleycam2883 re: libya hillary took the blame for obama. 
mitt's proposed tax cuts for the middle class will spur record economic growth. 


if obama goes after mitt's private sector experience in the next debate then mitt should ask for obama's college records all of them. 
.@mystikangel bring @johnrich back? he is back 


what is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all. we should be given credit for taking this risk. 
can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight? 
robert pattinson should not take back kristen stewart. she cheated on him like a dog & will do it again just watch. he can do much better 
michael vick of the philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback. 
initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped. see what happens when i am not mentioned. 
just read about my friend @hulkhogan he was set up too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles. 
@billrancic bill you should have named your beautiful son donald. 
joe girardi @yankees must play his starters, even a rod, they got you there. 
while the @yankees look like they quit and are finished, they won't quit for cc 

cc is a great pitcher and can handle pressure @yankees will win tonight. so far my predictions have all been correct. 
george steinbrenner @yankees would have gotten out of a rod's contract three years ago...but put a rod in tonight. 
obama talks about what he is going to do why the hell didn't he just do it, especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary 
obama at big debate disadvantage he just can't get away from his bad record. 
.@mittromney scored last night on both substance and style. 

...bad decisions can be devastating. 
obama was beaten but not knocked out. he lives to fight another day. but in the real world presidents are not given a second chance... 
all the guys that said @mittromney would lose are rapidly coming on board. mitt will remember the early helpers. 
if obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically, environmentally & aesthetically. 
robert bryce @nypost congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines & how destructive they are. windmills are a disaster. 
remember, new environment friendly lightbulbs can cause cancer. be careful the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care. 
wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds, they are killing the finances & environment of many countries & communities. 
great article on wind turbines by robert bryce in today's @nyposthttp://bit.ly/v5awvj  
really enjoyed discussing @yankees yesterday with @realmicihaelkay. i am a long time yankee fan. 

@marileenelson thanks 

my twitter followers will soon be over 2 million & all the biggies. it's like having your own newspaper. 
my twitter has become so powerful that i can actually make my enemies tell the truth. 
polls are starting to look really bad for obama. looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win. don't put it past him 
obama did much better than he did last time but still lost decisively. 
do you believe barack hussein obama (aka barry soetoro) looked like a president last night? i don't 
obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. if we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period 
i still love derek, he is a winner 
remember, i said derek don't sell your trump world tower apartment...its been lucky for you. the day after he sold it, he broke his foot. 
at the debate, the president kept talking of what he is going to do. i kept saying, why didn't he do it? he lost me a long time ago. 
verlander pitched great, but @yankees look truly defeated. 
stupid george will gave @mittromney no chance 3 months ago. take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy. 
george will said best debate he ever saw . if you ever heard george will speak(boring) anything is exciting. 
debate showed these guys really hate each other. at one point it looked like they would come to blows.  

you talk tough, mr. president, but have done nothing about china killing our jobs and economy. 
such long rhetorical and boring answers from obama. no wonder nothing gets done. 
.@mittromney much better on libya and middle east problems. obama has no answer. 
obama keeps namedropping bill clinton he is no bill clinton. 
obama weak on immigration. all words, no action. he's been prez 4 years. 
obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @mittromney is looking strong and sharp. 
obama just said @mittromney was a very successful investor big mistake for obama to admit he has less and less credibility. 
obama keeps saying that he will do something but why hasn't he done it? it's all talk. 
.@mittromney looks much stronger and much more presidential 
then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices? 
good response on jobs by @mittromney. 
why has obama let china and others take our jobs? 
why hasn't obama created jobs? 
getting ready to watch the debate as they say let's get ready to rumble 
i was just told by one of the top @pgatour players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country. very nice compliment i agree. 
we should be able to negotiate a deal with iran because they know we could blow them away to the stone age.they just don't believe we would. 
@drumline_mormon it is selling great at macy's thanks 
for political purposes only, obama is planning to hit libya for the benghazi embassy attack right before the election? 
great win last night by peyton manning & @denver_broncos in san diego coming from 24 points behind on the road. very impressive. 
if the @yankees can somehow beat verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series. and i will go to games 6& 7 so they will win 
get ready for tonight 
@missusa olivia we love you. you are doing a great job. 
.@mittromney if obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records & transcripts he will quiet down quickly. 
good luck @mittromney tonight have no doubt you will be great. 
congratulations to @jamesokeefeiii on exposing more democrat voter fraud. @dnc was caught red handed telling people to vote twice. 
i bet the terrorists in libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in benghazi. 

between libya, the national security leaks and fast & furious, obama has had more national security scandals than any other president. 
.@reince is doing a fantastic job for the republican party hope he gets the credit he deserves. 
.@antbaxter i tried watching but fell asleep. 
.@history's wonderful the men who built america with me on tonight at 9 bad timing, i'll be live tweeting the debate 
because obama was so pathetic in the first debate, tonight's audience will be humongous people want to see if he is for real. 
the coca cola company is not happy with me that's okay, i'll still keep drinking that garbage. 
it's amazing my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @cnbc draw the highest ratings. and they get bigger week by week thanks folks 
had a great time with @paulryanvp last night on the intrepid. paul is terrific. 
obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. at least he is consistent. 
all the morons that cause the controversy in scotland have made my development far more successful than anticipated. 

diet coke tweet had a monster response dammit, i wish the stuff worked. 
.@antbaxter thanks for helping promote & make trump international golf links scotland so successful you stupid fool 
.@antbaxter your documentary died many deaths. you have, in my opinion, zero talent. 
i can confirm the reports @billrancic, my first season winner, will be returning to this all star season of @celebapprentice. 
.@rupertmurdoch is absolutely right, it will be a nightmare for @israel if obama is re elected. 
verlander is great but very beatable. does not have a good era in playoff games 
i turned down going to the debate tonight so that i could do live tweets to my many followers. 
i have no doubt that mitt will do really well tonight. we'll all be watching @mittromney. 
lots of pressure on obama tonight even more than a rod. if he doesn't perform well it could be over. 
i hope a rod has a great night for the yankees he owes it to them especially with derek hurt. 
@jbluvx2 happy birthday 
gov. gary johnson pulling votes from @mittromney don't waste your vote. obama must go 

based on very popular demand, i will be live tweeting tomorrow night during the presidential debate. 
the invisible hand of the market always moves faster and better than the heavy hand of government. @mittromney 
sometimes the best thing you can do is just let things ride, let time go by. donald j. trump 
the more diet coke, diet pepsi, etc you drink, the more weight you gain? 

if @mittromney has a good debate tomorrow night, obama is finished 


once again obama fails to classify china as a currency manipulator. he just helped china steal even more jobs and money from us. 
looking forward to honoring the great dogan family and the success of the trump towers project in istanbul @followturkey annual gala dinner 
a rod should donate his contract to charity. he doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform. he is a $30m/yr rip off. 
looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @mittromney supporters at the intrepid. mitt's doing well. 

the @brooklynnets logo is plain and boring but if they win it won't matter. 
.@antbaxter's documentary on my scottish golf club was so boring and wrong. he is a small timer with no talent. 
my @foxandfriends interview discussing @joebiden's performance, the libya cover up and tomorrow's crucial debatehttp://bit.ly/qnyqhu  
barack obama is not who you think he is. most overrated politician in us history. 
isn't it time that obama release his college records and applications? boy would that create a mess he is not who you think.

lots of response to my comment on diet coke  let's face it, it doesn't work just makes you hungry. 
lots of response on derek but i told him his apartment was lucky we love derek. 
in case you missed it, my @todayshow interview discussing announcing the all star cast of @celebapprenticehttp://on.today.com/qvmyd0  
.@arsenioofficial why not everyone else is using it it's available at @macys. 
@schroedboss @erichfschroeder and your parents meant the world to me 
a rod was a great player when he lived at trump park avenue even though he was on the juice 
@mcginness1 thanks a great country 
derek jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at trump world tower i told him not to sell karma? 
.@sbelsbel3555 sorry, @piersmorgan is a very smart guy 
.@erichfschroeder your dad was a great man & great leader. 
@leighannmac thank you 
i love @libertyuniversity such great people 
a rod is just not making it. we want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great. 
i feel guilty not having attended the last two @yankees games (losses). they would have won 
obama will be trying very hard at next debate he doesn't want to lose the boeing. 
who says obama will do better in the next debate has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks 
.@mittromney's poll numbers are looking really good. one more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout.  
i have never seen a thin person drinking diet coke. 
no, i wasn't at the @yankees game yesterday can't go today either. when i go, they win. 

yankees can win today. kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher. 
a rod hit ball hard first at bat. time for him to step up and leave. 
swisher should have caught ball in right field last night. 
.@yankees are in trouble without derek. try a rod at short get him some confidence. 
a bad thing finally happened to derek jeter he is a great champion. 
so much for washington shutting down strasburg they deserved to lose. 
roadway steel on beautiful verrazano narrows bridge is rusting and rotting away. scrape and paint before too late. 
tonight, despite everything, put a rod in the lineup.  
everyone's wondering what's wrong with a rod. not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore the real reason.  
they found jessica in colorado body was mutilated death to the pervert killer. 
joe girardi did a great job of managing the yankees this series. 
i'll bet obama goes down just like washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win. 
washington should have brought in strasburg to relieve they would have won. 
when strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency washington will say what were we doing . 
i told you, whenever i go to a @yankees game the @yankees win. 
leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality. warren g. bennis 
when an employee leaves me and begs to come back i never let them. loyalty is very important. 
i look forward to tuesday night's presidential debate i wonder if obama will use my name again. 
very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate. 
what we are watching on our tv screens is the unraveling of the obama foreign policy. @paulryanvp 
obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families. the price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected. 
with our amazing all star cast, @joan_rivers, @johnrich, @arsenioofficial & @piersmorgan are also returning as boardroom advisors. 
great to hear that our loyal @celebapprentice fans are happy with today's announcement of the new cast. this will be something special 
.@dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act. 
i'm going to the @yankees game tonight to root them on they always win when i am there. 
my scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world a great honor for me. 

doing the @todayshow with @mlauer was great i really like matt. 

there are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still. pres. franklin d. roosevelt 
@dennisrodman @apprenticenbc great to have you back for the best season yet 
obamacare is a complete disaster. many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it. terrible. 
wing bangers the name given to wind turbines by bird lovers for the thousands of birds they kill in the u.s. 
british pm cameron is making a fool of himself by wasting billions of pounds on unwanted & environment destroying scottish windmills. 
going over to @todayshow now to introduce @apprenticenbc cast etc. watch. 








looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment. 

another sign that @jack_welch is right. new government labor report casts even more doubt on the september jobs datahttp://www.aei ideas.org/2012/10/new government report casts even more doubt on the september jobs data/ … 

it's thursday and only 26 days until the election. how many illegal donations from china and saudi arabia did obama collect today? 

our foreign policy decisions are dumbest in u.s. history 
live tweeting during tonight's vp debate...should be a great time 
how the hell does the libyan government get off telling our embassy security they can't have loaded guns for protection? 
why the hell did we help the libyan rebels in the first place. that is the real scandal. 
outright disgusting the obama administration has continually stonewalled and lied to us amb. sean smith's motherhttp://drudge.tw/rxv7in  
i suspect @joebiden could do well tonight. don't be fooled by his gaffes. he is a seasoned and feisty debater. 
if @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish. a beater is always a beater just watch 
amazing that derek jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well. 
$30m a year and a rod is now relegated to the bench. @yankees would have lost if girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction) 
i guess they have lance armstrong cold. brutal report. a waste of taxpayer money to take down an american hero. 
.@apprenticenbc cast will be announced tomorrow at 7:30am et on the @todayshow with @mlauer 
staff at trump park avenue disliked a rod to put it mildly the staff at trump world tower loves derek jeter. 
asking why my dislike of a rod dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal 
great move to take a rod out of game. now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation (drugs). 
raul ibanez did something never done in baseball history. amazing move by manager joe g.

@usa67us thank you 


congratulations to @flgovscott on getting an a grade from @catoinstitute on his fiscal policy. rick is a fantastic governor. 

i am more concerned about biden in the debate than i am about obama. be careful on thursday night 
you have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving big bird. @mittromney 

a rod must be dropped in the yankees line up tonight if they want to win. he simply can't perform without drugs. 

receiving thousands of thank you letters from @libertyu students for my convocation speech. the honor was all mine great people. 

47m on food stamps. over 23m americans unemployed. 50% of college grads unemployed. and obama wants us talking about big bird. 
has barack obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations? media? 
i just had to fire someone, he didn't have a clue he reminded me of obama on wednesday night. 
27 days until america's greatest test since our founding. in this election, we decide whether we become great again. 
it doesn't matter who you vote for it matters who is counting the votes. be careful of voter fraud 
obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate. let's see how he reacts under pressure. 
remember, obama limped across the finish line he should have lost to hillary. be careful 
i don't think obama will do well in the second debate he is psyched out just like a rod. 
i will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. on this, there will be no flexibility with vladimir putin. mitt 
how can british pm cameron spend so much money on scottish windmills which are ruining the countryside? 
by popular request i will also be tweeting live during the vice presidential debate thursday night. it will be very interesting, i promise. 
.@davidletterman @late_show fully apologized last night for calling me a racist. thank you david we are again friends. 
the public is about to learn a lot more information on barack obama and his true background in the coming weeks… 
now that obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in libya or iran. he is desperate. 
mitt’s subsequent rise in the polls post debate shows that the american public can still spot a real winner. 
“in order to build your wealth and improve your business smarts, you need to know about real estate.” think like a billionaire 
with these record high gas prices, what does it say about obama that he was trying to brag about his energy policy in the debate? 
looking forward to live tweeting during the rest of the debates. will be a lot of fun. 
when will the unemployment numbers be corrected? sadly, after the election 

george will is a political moron. last month he said romney couldn't win. 
in the end, andy pettitte did not rat out his friend roger clemens. i like him again, a lot. 
drop a rod in the order and cut his salary based on unreported drug use. also, not a pressure player. 

why isn't obama protecting us from ridiculous gas prices? 
california gas prices going thru the roof, others to follow. an election losing event for obama. 
greece should get out of the euro & go back to their own currency they are just wasting time. 
.@erraticslk shout out = work hard 
.@carlosbeltran15 is playing great for st. louis cardinals. they made a wise decision. 
.@jack_welch is correct these reporters would not have been so brave while jack was running ge. 
our many loyal viewers should expect a major announcement very soon on next season's @celebapprentice. our fans will be pleased. 
sleepy eyes @chucktodd whenever you mention me unfairly i will likewise mention you. 


china is taking the oil in libya while our embassy is being attacked after we won the war for the rebels. obama's policies suck 

@bigtigga12 work hard, love what you do, keep focused, never lose your momentum. 
how long did it take for obama to call hugo chavez and congratulate him on his 'reelection?' who do you think chavez supports in ours? 
congratulations to @drewbrees on setting the @nfl record with 48 consecutive games with a td pass. he is a great guy and player. 
at the request of many i will be doing live tweets during the next presidential debate. 
great win last night for the @yankees in baltimore. 
sleepy eyes @chucktodd is an absolute joke of a reporter. he is in the bag for obama. he can't carry @jack_welch's jock. 
who is more believable on the state of employment the great @jack_welch or some government bureaucrat who is voting for obama? 
it's great that sleepy eyes @chucktodd gets no traction. 


i would do same thing if i were china. they want obama.http://bit.ly/sxja4d  
i told alex salmond that he should never have released al megrahi when he foolishly asked me for support

@hightide1989 amazing is good too. 
@lulucornbread @celebapprentice most likely in february. 
the upcoming season of @celebapprentice will be terrific a great cast. 

congratulations to michelle and barack obama on their 20th anniversary. 
happy to have just passed 1.5m followers on twitter. we picked up over 14,000 yesterday alone. it's great to speak to everyone daily. 
i'm eagerly awaiting the next polls. the debate performance could be devastating to the obama team. let's see what happens. 
@fstltd @tonyrobbins will be a great event. see you in london. 
both being optimistic and remembering the big picture have served me well throughout my life. you need to stay positive. 
.@sethmacfarlane will be a great oscar host. he did an amazing job at my @comedycentral roast. 
@ajb073 thank you. 
wind farms are ugly, not cost effective and don't produce worthwhile returns or energy. no wonder governments are giving up on them. 
as a big job creator, i was greatly honored to have been mentioned twice tonight during the debate. 
congratulations to mitt romney. he was not only good, he was absolutely fantastic tonight 
invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the attack. sun tzu 
there's only one candidate who cut medicare and that's barack obama. cut over $700m to move into obamacare. 

have you heard? china just told obama to jump. obama asked how high. 
obama's '07 speech which @dailycaller just released not only shows that obama is a racist but also how the press always covers for him. 
i'm always amazed when i travel to my foreign properties.seeing the trump brand across 4 continents proves that excellence can be universal. 
@siphosimelane thank you. 
@escobedoantonio thank you 
@lexi_michaels yes, absolutely.

i'll be on @gretawire tonight on @foxnews at 10 pm. 
great to hear that @nfl legend and hall of famer john elway has endorsed @mittromney in colorado. co is a must win state for mitt. 
under obama, iran has taken over iraq, al qaeda has taken over libya, the muslim brotherhood now controls egypt. worst foreign policy ever. 
woody johnson's comments that he would rather have @mittromney win the election than his @nyjets win games shows real patriotism. 
the chinese are now hacking white house computers. why not? they already own the place. 
big win by @yankees last night to take control of al east. jeter & company now control their destiny. 
wednesday's debate is day one of the election. over 70 million voters will be watching.

a clip from @katieshow where i take @katiecouric's audience on the katie coachhttp://bit.ly/sgq1cq  

if obama mentions mitt's tax returns in tomorrow's debate then mitt should immediately ask for obama's college records & applications 



al qaeda taking over libya after we made it possible really amazing. 
venezuelan leader hugo chavez said in a television interview that aired on sunday if i were american, i'd vote for obama. 
big cancer risk from new environmental light bulbs a big price to pay 
obama now wants to give another $450m to the muslim brotherhood. money we don't have going to people that hate us. moronic. 
how many more of our soldiers have to be shot by the afghanis they are training? let's get the hell out of there and focus on u.s.

lots of people agree that the emmys were a joke got bad ratings no credibility 
.@cheaterbella thanks (i think) 

republicans and @mittromney must get tough very soon. 

in debate, @mittromney should ask obama why autobiography states born in kenya, raised in indonesia.

...never let yourself be pushed around but treat the good folks great.

...well into our 4th week of shooting the record 13th season of @celebapprentice. the 'all stars' are hard at work...

muslim brotherhood head of egypt morsi is already making demands on obama before the wh visit. obama's foreign policy is a complete failure. 
coincidence? obama and ahmadinejad each describe @israel's warning over the iranian nuclear program as just 'noise'http://bit.ly/sf3s2d  
home values have sunk a record 15% under obama. 
the debates are going to have a big impact on the election. @mittromney has proved in florida he delivers under pressure. 

living in denial only 15% of democrats think that recent economic news is poorhttp://cbsloc.al/r33nlq  
scary obama's budget deficits are so out of control that he has to borrow 40 cents on every dollar he spends. 


congratulations to brandt snedeker on his $11.4m payday on sunday by winning the tour championship and fedex cup. well done. 
rt @mittromney: i am running for president to get us creating wealth again not to redistribute it. 
with obama and bernanke destroying the value of the dollar, gold and real estate should continue to rise in value. 
the attack on our libyan consulate was the worst attack on the us since 9/11. time for obama to come clean. 
despite all of china's cheating, they are not doing that well we can beat them our country has great potential 
all these polls released by news outlets are oversampling democrats. they want to influence public perception of the race. 
the emmys are all politics, that's why, despite nominations, the apprentice never won even though it should have many times over. 
amazing race winning an emmy again is a total joke. the emmys have no credibility no wonder the ratings are at record lows. 
despite the emmy's being terrible as a show, @jimmykimmel was excellent and i think his late night show will be a hit. 
the emmys were horrendous...the absolute worst show

@libertyu @michelebachmann it was an honor for me. thank you. 
with all of the bad economic numbers and horrendous foreign policy, obama should be down by 12 points and he's not. 

reverend @jeremiahwright has to be really angry. they threw him aside like he was nothing. 
the republican party must spend its money wisely and do incredible television commercials. they must be tough and smart. 
why did @mittromney give his tax returns without demanding that obama release his college records & applications in return? 
just left liberty university. chancellor jerry falwell jr.& his father have done an amazing job...great school & the students were fantastic 
the ryder cup will be amazing this week.

@jessestroup nice to hear and good luck 




my @cnn interview with @piersmorgan explaining why mitt should not apologizehttp://bit.ly/pxlzgj  


isn’t it great that obama had time yesterday to fundraise with jay z and do @late_show while there is a record 21% real unemployment 
qe3, a political favor for obama, will cause record inflation on food and fuel. this hits low income families the hardest. big mistake.

technology has shown we have tremendous energy resources right under our feet that we didn't know about 5 years ago. 
the stage is set for the real debate it will be very interesting 
obama should play golf with republicans & opponents rather than his small group of friends. that way maybe the terrible gridlock would end.

can you believe they are blaming @mittromney for egypt. 
.@rickymoney i don't know a lot about failures. and as you know, i never went bankrupt. 
.@lightjzup industrial turbines are destroying our land. 
liberal press won't look into why obama ignored security warnings for embassies but is obsessed with romney's private comments. 
none of romney's leaked comments change the fact that obama is a complete disaster. 20% real unemployment and $6t in deficit spending. 
it's tuesday. how many more non stories will the liberal media try to manufacture so everyone ignores obama's record? 
the majority of americans agree with @mittromney's comments on @israel and iran. 
with 49 days until the election, @mittromney needs to stay on offense. he should not be apologizing. deflect onto obama's record. 



@princeetornam they had both interest and aptitude. they've done a terrific job. 

@rdowns i never went bankrupt. enemies love to say i did. didn't happen.

@iona1991 thank you, and happy to hear you enjoyed our colt's neck course, it's a beauty.

after being ripped off for years, obama finally figured out that china is taking advantage of us. he's finally listening to me. 
who wouldn't take kate's picture and make lots of money if she does the nude sunbathing thing. come on kate 
kate middleton is great but she shouldn't be sunbathing in the nude only herself to blame.

hey @kimkardashian i hear you are undecided in the election. i can explain why you should vote for @mittromney. 
if you want to know how to prevail through tough circumstances then read the art of the comeback. 



@shawn_maynard this is our 13th season. no precise date yet but most likely in the early spring. shooting is underway. will be terrific. 
@steelchecker jody agreed. 
rt @mittromney: for nearly 4 years, barack obama has refused to crack down on china's cheating & american workers have paid the price. 
why doesn't obama let our marines who are guarding the embassies in egypt have live ammunition? they need it fast. 
it's amazing @hardball_chris has completely lost all connections to reality. he is a complete shill for obama. 
@scottsaia23 thanks scott. i appreciate your nice words.

must see video obama's criticism of @mittromney is identical to carter's on reaganhttp://bit.ly/qqswgb  



.@mittromney should continue to stay on offense on the embassy issue. obama, who put these radicals in power, deserves blame. 
obama's convention bounce is gone. @mittromney has retaken the lead in the latest @rasmussenpollhttp://bit.ly/ovetn  
it's thursday, how many more bias press reports will be released against @mittromney? 
why are we still giving billions of dollars we don't have in foreign aid to the muslim brotherhood in egypt? 
i will be speaking monday, september 24, (10 a.m.) at liberty university, to a record setting student body. i look forward to it 
the media is pathetic. our embassies are savaged by radicals while obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @mittromney. 
what a coincidence that obama's good friends in libya and egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies. 
with allies like egypt and libya, who needs enemies? 
shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11? 
obama told @nbc that egypt is no longer an ally. they used to be until he pushed out mubarak. 
filming of the record 13th season of @celebapprentice has started. be sure to be on the lookout for future updates. 

if obama was smart, he would cancel the muslim brotherhood's wh visit later this month. he won't. 

with the high prices of corn to continue expect even more inflation on the price of food. 
obama's foreign policy is a complete and total disaster the worst president we have ever had. 
we threw our ally mubarak overboard and egypt is now our enemy. great going obama israel is in trouble. 
this is all about american weakness and an incompetent president. 

weakness, cow towing and not standing firm is provocative. we are getting pushed around and robbed under this president. 
the only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. vince lombardi 
our $16t national debt is now bigger than our $15t gdp. if obama is re elected watch for an economic meltdown in 2013. 
deja vu i can remember a time when our embassies were stormed under another failed president. obama=carter. 
i guess obama's cairo speech really worked out. the muslim brotherhood stormed our embassy on 9.11. imagine if obama speaks in beijing? 
those who refuse to draw red line to iran don't have the moral right to put a red line to @israel. @israelipm @netanyahu 

obama will go down as the worst president in history on many topics but especially foreign policy. 


opec will use yesterday's attacks on our embassies to raise the price of gas. they are always ripping us off. 
it's wednesday, how many more of our embassies will be stormed by islamists? 
what did we get for fighting in libya besides a dead ambassador. demand their oil. 
as bad as they were, i don't remember our embassies being attacked when mubarak and gaddafi were in power. 

obama is a disaster at foreign policy. never had the experience or knowledge. he is not capable of doing the job. 
libya is selling its oil to china i notice the chinese ambassador is very safe. 
i always said the people we fought for in libya were bad news. once again, i was right. 


we fight to free libya and they kill our ambassador and other americans. obama's foreign policy is a joke. 
when will obama next go on vacation if he wins the election? the day after. 
i've read many books about china over the decades. i know the chinese and made a lot of money with them. the art of the deal 
why is the pentagon wasting precious dollars on going 'green.' complete waste. we need the best & easiest fuel for our military. 
i hope the @gop realizes that if they blow this election the tea party won't be with them next time. 
there is no instance of a nation benefitting from prolonged warfare. sun tzu 
if obama wins it is the end of the republican party. @limbaugh 
amazing. @celebapprentice has started filming our record 13th season this week thanks to our big and very loyal fan base. 
priorities while fundraising and campaigning on our dime, obama has skipped over 50% of his intel briefingshttp://wapo.st/pid36v  

why won't obama release his college applications? is there something 'foreign' about them? 
84% of us troops wounded & 70% of our brave men & women killed in afghanistan have all come under obama. time to get out of there. 
whatever happened to obama's 'independent investigation' into national security leaks from his administration? where's the media? 
the onus of the chicago teachers' strike falls squarely on the teachers & their union. inexcusable to leave children without school. 
on this solemn day of remembrance we can all take joy in the fact that bin laden's last sight was a navy seal pulling the trigger.

one of the best moves i ever made was staying out of last decade's artificial real estate boom. but i used the downturn to my advantage. 

a lot of people strongly advised me against doing @apprenticenbc. next week we start filming the record 13th season hence, go with your gut 
if @barackobama had to use the same labor participation he had when he entered office then the unemployment number would be 11.2% 

unemployment rate only dropped because more people are out of labor force & have stopped looking for work.not a real recovery, phony numbers 
there are now 119,000 fewer americans employed than there were in july. the economy is still terrible. 
today's job report is dismal. now a record 88,921,000 americans are no longer in the work force. 
drew peterson, a real sleaze, just convicted of killing wife. change the law so he gets death penalty. 
dems had a very good and professional convention. the republicans must be smart and tough and fast 
the republicans must get virgil goode out of the race in virginia. he will take votes away from @mittromney. 

under @barackobama, 1 out of every 7 americans is on food stamps. 
scary while @barackobama has been potus for 1.6% of america's history, he has amassed 33.3% of the total debt. 
we've gone from $10 trillion that the president inherited from all prior presidents to $16 trillion @mittromney 
forty seven million now on food stamps. when he came to office there were 32 million. he's added 15 million people. @mittromney 

remember while @barackobama is lauding himself tonight with self indulgent compliments we have our brave soldiers fighting in afghanistan. 
after @barackobama's speech tonight which should be well delivered reality will hit friday morning when the new jobs report is released. 
the delegates at the @dnc convention keep shouting four more years. four more years of 18% real unemployment and another $6t in debt? 
now we will never know if @barackobama would have been able to fill bank of america stadium. pretty convenient. 
.@barackobama is now taking credit for changing party platform language but he reviewed it prior to the conventionhttp://drudge.tw/ty2o4o  

iran is flying supply planes to syria through iraqi airspace. thank you, united states, for making this possible 
bill clinton did a great job last night the democrats are lucky to have him. do you really believe he likes @barackobama?

scary thought is the sexual pervert anthony weiner now in charlotte? did he bring his phone with him? 
the democrats dropped all references to god from their platform. not good 

better off? the $16t us debt works out to $136,260 per household, a 50% increase since @barackobama took office. 
north carolina is a fantastic state with wonderful people. i enjoy my time there when i visit trump national charlotte. 
i wish the 23 million who are unemployed were able to celebrate like the democrats in charlotte right now. 
almost every t.v. show is asking me to go on especially the @late_show. it's simple i get the ratings 

with all the talk of fiscal responsibility at the @dnc convention yesterday, it was ironic that the debt passed $16t. 
.@lancearmstrong, revise your decision to quit go back and fight. 
why does us doping agency destroy an american icon, @lancearmstrong, for events that took place years ago in france? 
.@lancearmstrong teammate is angry and jealous he is no lance. 
very good speech by @michelleobama and under great pressure dems should be proud 

july u.s. construction had biggest drop in 12months. bad indicator on economic numbers for rest of the year. 
what message does it send when @barackobama's campaign has to spin whether america is better off than it was 4 years ago? 
opec is better off than they were 4 years ago. gas has more than doubled during @barackobama's term. outrageous 
the chinese are better off than they were 4 years ago. they have stolen even more from us in jobs & trade during @barackobama's term. 

nbc wall st journal poll of african american voters: 94% @barackobama, 0% @mittromney.even worse than hillary's old numbers. is that racism? 
with our national debt passing $16t during the @dnc convention, @barackobama has amassed more debt than the first 42 presidents. scary. 
record setting gas prices in the u.s. we're really looking dumb. lots of $'s being made on us. 
the media can track down @paulryan's old girlfriend and marathon time but can't find @barackobama's college applications or other info. 
smart move by @barackobama having pres. bill clinton deliver the @dnc convention keynote. 
this week the @dnc convention will deliver hard hits on @mittromney. @rnc will regret being soft on @barackobama last week. 
.@robinroberts of @gma is terrific get better soon. 
.@barackobama claims to have policies for working people... 

is this hope & change? a record 46.7m americans were on food stamps this past june. we must do better. 
why does @barackobama have such a fascination with my plane? he is more than welcomed to come for a ride. 
joe paterno's family should sue the idiots @pennstate that made that ridiculous deal and commissioned the one sided report.

.@barackobama's assault on coal and gas and oil will send energy and manufacturing jobs to china. @mittromney 
i am sure the chinese are getting anxious. they watch the polls. @mittromney won't let them cheat us anymore. 
we have all the cards. now is the time to make a great deal with iran.

if you accept the expectations of others, especially negative ones, then you will never change the outcome. michael jordan 
gas prices are about to hit a record high during the labor day weekend. @barackobama could have stopped this. 
it's friday, how many advertisers dropped @huffpost today? 
a fact golfers don't get aches & pains like others who don't golf. it is amazingly remedial. 
of course @hardball_chris attacked 'birthers' in praising @condoleezzarice's speech. chris has completely lost it. 
letterman @late_show begging me to go back on his low rated show calls lots must apologize for racist comment. 
too busy playing golf? @barackobama sends form letters with an electronic signature to the parents of fallen sealshttp://bit.ly/sueuzm  
i am impressed with how clearly @paulryanvp explains the challenges we face and the solutions @mittromney will bring as president. 
book on bin laden is a terrible violation of code makes @barackobama's story a big lie. 
i wonder what @joebiden was thinking last night as @paulryanvp delivered that knockout speech. joe should call in sick for the vp debate. 
after four years of getting the run around, america needs a turnaround, and the man for the job is governor mitt romney. @paulryanvp 
the dummies left iraq (and libya) without the oil 
let me say it as clearly as possible, that the attack on my catholic brothers and sisters is an attack on me. @govmike huckabee 
congratulations to @govmikehuckabee on last night's tremendous speech. mike united the party faithful and explained that we can do better. 
only two weeks until we start shooting @celebapprentice. we really have something amazing for the fans this year. 
gas prices are way too high. with an economy contracting and lower demand, how do opec & the speculators get away with this? 

it's thursday and again i ask how much money is china stealing from us? 
i was putting together my early deals in new york & i was advised by many that i was too young. believe in yourself & you can do anything. 

i am astonished that the media continues to lie. @barackobama gutted welfare reform. it is a fact 
america needs @mittromney and @paulryanvp and we need them right now. @govchristie 
no one will work harder. no one will move heaven and earth like mitt romney to make this country a better place to live @anndromney 
new business start ups at the lowest level in 30 years and the epa is now the employment prevention agency. @bobmcdonnell 
it's wednesday, how much money is china stealing from us today? 
great speech by my good friend @govchristie. he did something you won't hear at @barackobama's convention tell the truth. 

congratulations to @anndromney on delivering a knock out speech last night. america can't wait to call her our first lady. 

china must be worried that @mittromney will win this november. they have never had such a pushover like @barackobama. 

.@barackobama's dismal job record is reason alone that he must be defeated this november. 
i am very worried that if @barackobama is re elected then medicare will be destroyed. we must take care of our seniors. 


i stand ready to lead us down a new path, where we are lifted up by our desire to succeed, not by a resentment of success. @mittromney 
it's tuesday how much inflation has @barackobama's spending caused today on the price of food and gas? 
.@govchristie is going to do a fantastic job tonight explaining why @mittromney should be elected and @barackobama has to go. 
.@melaniatrump and i are looking forward to watching @anndromney's speech tonight. she is an amazing woman who will be a great first lady 
happy to hear that @ralphreed's faith and freedom chapters are at the @rnc convention supporting @mittromney. we must be united to win

my robocall on behalf of @mittromney playing across the state of michiganhttp://politi.co/ala4rx  





@celebapprentice is having wonderful ratings once again. @ivankatrump & @donaldjtrumpjr. i am very proud of this season. 


the more i get to know @mittromney the more i like him. he has the judgment and private sector experience america needs in the white house. 






if the gop will have any chance to beat @barackobama in november, the great people of michigan need to support @mittromney's candidacy. 










our ally canada wants to send their oil down south to us. @barackobama is forcing canada to send it west to china. 


don't forget sunday night at 9 pm est on @nbc celebrity apprentice is back tune in for a great show. @apprenticenbc 



weakness is very dangerous: @barackobama is going to unilaterally disarm our nuclear arsenal. america keeps the world safe 

the fed is considering issuing even more us bond debt into the market. not good

very successful fund raising for @mittromney yesterday. good to see my friend woody johnson. 
@memoinc you have to find a business that you love. that's number one. success requires passion. then keep your focus and never give up. 
@dansalbreiter maybe they don't want to. 
@stecbeck thanks, i'll keep at it. 
@jtatsuno no, not trademarked. 



wrong policy: @barackobama wants to cut defense spending by $487b while china is building their navy in the pacific.http://reut.rs/zttd4f  
the recession was made worse by @barackobama. a $900billion deficit is not getting better. 
when the economy is bad, @barackobama wants to raise taxes. when the economy is good, @barackobama wants to raise taxes. notice a trend? 
iran's attack on israeli diplomats is an attack on the west

@atlthrasher i don't think it has run its course. there are opportunities. finding them and maximizing them are key components for success. 
@hangersmensline my agenda is such that i can't meet with you, but it's always nice to be asked and i wish you the best. 
@the_joey that could be a possibility but there are no plans at the moment. this season of celebrity apprentice is great be sure to watch. 




flattering. over 500 upset people called mar a lago disappointed i am not running for president but mitt romney will do a great job. 






@barackobama's budget funds the arab spring with $800b and the muslim brotherhood in egypt $1.3b in military aid. he loves radical islam. 


so wrong @barackobama is hosting china's vp xi jinping today at the pentagon with a full honor ceremony with music and cannons... 
a day after @barackobama released a trillion dollar budget deficit, he is hosting china's future leader vp xijinping. america's new reality. 

a day after greece burned @barackobama released a $3.8 trillion budget for 2013 with a $900 billion deficit.he will turn america into greece

my @foxandfriends interview discussing my friend whitney houston, @sarahpalinusa's cpac speech,the economy and primaryhttp://bit.ly/xdexcb  
whitney houston was a great friend and an amazing talent. we will all miss her and send our prayers to her family. 
this week we saw what obama care actually does when implemented. it is a losing issue for @barackobama and must be repealed. 
@barackobama’s class warfare rhetoric is taking a backseat for the dnc convention. he is charging $1 million for a single suite. 
the $25 billion settlement with the banks on mortgages will slow the housing market down even more and create higher user fees. stupid 


@mittromney will give a great speech at cpac today. he understands the threat from china. 




keystone must be approved. oil is at a record high. we need to use our resources and support allies like canada. 
@wyattbrian timing is important, so considerations such as your financial situation and how solid your plans are should be reviewed. 
the church is yet another victim to his liberal agenda: @barackobama lied to his catholic supporters to pass obamacare. 

the fed is destroying the dollar. when inflation hits the economy then even more jobs will go overseas. 
q/a @stalkinpeople yes, i'd give the real numbers. 
q/a @saychowder i receive a great many requests for interviews, nationally and internationally.

@misterglorious i wear suits from the donald j. trump signature collection. 
jon huntsman called to see me. i said no, he gave away our country to china @jonhuntsman

@ianbqueen in answer to your question, my favorite thing to do is spending time with my family. 
@nathanfuchs @lawrence he's not a smart man. he is a poor journalist and he likes fabricating the truth all reasons why his ratings stink 
eli manning. great athlete. great guy. @nygiants great teamwork 
why is @mittromney the only guy who talks about getting tough with china and their currency manipulation? 
china did a major number on us during the reign of @jonhuntsman. he was easy pickens 




i see @flgovscott poll numbers are improving. good man doing a good job. 
many, many people are disappointed i didn't run third party but i won't risk @barackobama benefiting from a split in the anti obama vote. 
i endorsed @mittromney not because i agree with him on every issue but because he will get tough with china. 












the prayer breakfast was used by @barackobama to say that the bible commands higher income taxes. that's not the way it is 
the economy is in terrible shape. @barackobama is manipulating the job numbers to hide the truth.http://bit.ly/x5j3nx

keystone must be approved through congress. @barackobama is costing america over 20,000 jobs and driving the price of gas high. 
the gop primary is getting very nasty. the candidates need to remember that @barackobama is the main target. he must not be reelected.

check out this great story from the @wsj...http://on.wsj.com/a59nxq  

last night in his sotu, @barackobama claimed that he is a friend of israel. does anyone really believe that. 

after solyndra, @barackobama is stil intent on wasting our tax dollars on unproven technologies and risky companies. he must be accountable. 
notice how @barackobama failed to mention obamacare last night in his sotu. even he knows it is terrible. 

tom brokaw keeps calling mitt romney george (mitt's father). sadly, time is up for tom. 


all i heard in the sotu was proposals for more govt, more spending and more bureaucrats. very bad 
my daughter ivanka thinks i should run for president. maybe i should listen.http://bit.ly/wovnkn  
it is a shame keystone wasn't powered by solar panels and wind because then @barackobama would have wasted billions on it. 
a gallon of gas has more than doubled while @barackobama has been potus and he still won't approve keystone. 
it has been 1,000 days since @barackobama has passed a budget. he continues to spend this country into the ground without any control. 
tonight in his sotu, @barackobama won't talk about keystone. he will continue to dissemble about his record and play class warfare. 



it is time he proves he can negotiate a good deal: @johnboehner must tie any payroll tax cut extension directly to keystone being approved. 
my @foxandfriends interview discussing @newtgingrich's sc win, gop primary and successful business characteristicshttp://bit.ly/zktmqi  


iran is threatening to shut the strait of hormuz and @barackobama won't approve the keystone pipeline. his energy policy makes america weak. 
a tough week was had by@mittromney, but he's come back from adversity before. 



my @newsmax_media interview from friday where i predicted that @newtgingrich in south carolina would change the race.http://bit.ly/xofms6 
congratulations to @newtgingrich on a stunning win in south carolina. all eyes are on florida now. 

canada will now sell its oil to china because @barackobama rejected keystone. at least china knows a good deal when they see it. 

the white house should stop publicly pressuring israel on iran. iran's nuclear program is the threat, not israel's right to self defense. 


the law requires individuals pay 15% on carried interest. why would a potential president pay more than he or she is supposed to? 
the national debt continues to rise at record levels and today @barackobama is in disney world. he lives in a fantasy. 
when will @barackobama release his transcripts? what is he hiding? 
playing politics with the keystone decision? @barackobama vetos 20,000 jobs and cheaper oil. 
texas is lucky to have him @governorperry is a great guy

enjoyed giving a special video message yesterday at @ralphreed’s faith and freedom sc presidential kickoff. 


the debate was great last night all performed well 



while @barackobama is slashing the military, he is also negotiating with our sworn enemy the taliban who facilitated 9/11. 



our marines are sent to kill the taliban not coddle them. usmc should be praised not investigated. semper fi 
newt attacks on @mittromney record at bain an attack on free enterprise and entrepreneurship. mistake 
an iranian nuclear scientist's car exploded in tehran yesterday lots of problems to come @barackobama we need real leadership. 

with unempoyment over 10% in 2009, @barackobama held an extravagant alice in wonderland party. he is a man of the people 





opec has just raised oil to over $102/barrel. and @barackobama still won't approve the keystone pipeline. does he want high gas prices? 
why are we building a $1billion embassy in iraq when the country kicked us out, didn't give us any oil & is about to get taken over by iran? 
3 chief of staffs in less than 3 years of being president: part of the reason why @barackobama can't manage to pass his agenda. 
new hampshire has a major decision to make today. hopefully we won't have to hear any more mandarin spoken in future debates. 
this is why @timtebow is a winner. he lays everything out on the field. he never quits and never gives up. that's why he is a success.

my @todayshow interview where i reveal the new cast of celebrity apprentice and discuss the gop primary fieldhttp://on.today.com/a2ud5c  


nobody cares about the iowa straw poll is what @jonhuntsman said yesterday. his problem is that nobody cares about his campaign (or him). 

michele bachmann just dropped out of prez race when she didn't do the newsmax debate it showed great disloyalty and people rejected her. 
we left iraq and it is quickly falling apart what a waste of lives and money and so obvious. 



he should be ignored: @ronpaul's foreign policy is a dream come true for our enemies. he has zero chance to beat @barackobama. 
michele bachmann got less than 1,200 more votes in the caucus than she did in the ames straw poll. very sad for her a nice woman 
congratulations to @ricksantorum for coming out of iowa a winner 
it's no wonder @ricksantorum is surging in iowa he agreed to participate in the newsmax @iontv debate

the washington establishment will never rein in government spending, waste, fraud and abuse. a great thinker and outsider is needed. 
when will the us government finally classify china as a currency manipulator? china is robbing us blind and @barackobama defends them. 


i play golf to relax. my company is in great shape. @barackobama plays golf to escape work while america goes down the drain. 
nyc should hold a parade for returning iraq and afghanistan veterans. 

i like russell brand, but katy perry made a big mistake when she married him. let's see if i'm right i hope not. 
america wasted billions and precious lives in iraq and iran will soon take control very very sad. 


i predicted the 9/11 attack on america in my book the america we deserve and the collapse of iraq in @timetogettough. 
americans elect on track to put an indy presidential candidate on the ballot in all 50 states. 



the fed's reckless monetary policies will cause problems in the years to come. the fed has to be reined in or we will soon be greece.

@trumpcollection tops @travlandleisure 500 best hotels in the world congrats @trumpnewyork, @trumplasvegas, @trumpchicago, @trumpsoho 


the keystone pipeline will create 20,000 jobs and lower gas prices. but obama says no. dumb. 

a vote for @ronpaul is a totally wasted vote. if he wins iowa bad for iowa's credibility. 
govt. collapsing in iraq only 2 weeks after withdrawal of our troops. sadly, i called this one and please remember, i alone called it. 
the habitual vacationer, @barackobama, is now in hawaii. this vacation is costing taxpayers $4 milion while there is 20% unemployment. 
congratulations to my friends @newsmax. readership up 247%. 7 million people a month now reading. 
in order to preserve my options and guarantee that @barackobama is defeated, i changed my voter registration to independent. 

@trumpcollection tops @travlandleisure 500 best hotels in the world congrats @trumpnewyork, @trumplasvegas, @trumpchicago, @trumpsoho 
the keystone pipeline will create 20,000 jobs and make us less energy dependent from the middle east. @barackobama says no 
the safest way to preserve medicare is with a robust and vibrant economy. we should lower corporate and capital gain taxes immediately. 







my @foxnews interview with @gretawire discussing how @barackobama is delusional and how a 3rd party candidate can win.http://bit.ly/ugcgid  
barney frank looked disgusting nipples protruding in his blue shirt before congress. very very disrespectful. 

he is delusional: @barackobama believes that he is the 4th best potus ever. 
the wh yesterday defended biden's comments that the taliban aren't our enemy. when did the american people decide this?http://fxn.ws/v93olk  


i really enjoyed last night's tele town hall with @ralphreed's faith and freedom coalition. thanks to the thousands who joined. 
i still can't believe we didn't t take the oil from iraq. 




joe biden said that the taliban 'is not our enemy.' i wonder how our troops in afghanistant that are under attack view biden's statement. 
what a shock the u.s. capitol christmas tree pays homage @barackobama but failed to mention jesus. 
he thinks that the wealth you create belongs to the gov't. @barackobama doesn't respect the fact that the money he wastes belongs to us. 







china taxing imports from the us 22% why aren't we taxing china? 
dummies left iraq without the oil not believable 
iraq in political turmoil one day after we leave i told you so. 
even @barackobama's former national security advisor jim jones has called the keystone pipeline 'a national must.' america needs it. 

barney frank admited that obamacare does have 'death panels' yesterday. obamacare must be fully repealed or healthcare will be destroyed. 
with a record deficit and $15 trillion in debt, @barackobama is spending $4 million of our money on his hawaii vacation. just plain wrong. 
our diplomats are weak: @jonhuntsman's china policy proves why we need businesmen to negotiate against china. 
railing at obama over china: @maggiepoliticohttp://politi.co/vqdtgd

opec is setting crude at $94/barrel on 'signs us economy is improving.' opec uses any excuse to rip us off and our leaders just watch. 
china just put a tariff on us cars and trucks 22% china is laughing at our inept leaders. @barackobama 
the lightweight, @jonhuntsman, used my name in a debate for gravitas it didn't work. sad 


my interview with @barbarajwalters in her @abc special 'most fascinating people of 2011'http://abcn.ws/tnrmll  




so biased: @time made 'the protester' as the person of the year. @time celebrates ows but vilified the tea party last year. 

if speeches and memoirs created jobs then @barackobama would be ronald reagan. 



with the number of tweets sad sack @rosie has done, she has totally lost control of herself hopefully not a breakdown. 





the habitual vacationer, @barackobama, has sacrificed so much. he is delaying his 17 day hawaii vacation a couple of hours. 
iran is closing the strait of hormuz for a military exercise. imagine what they will do with nukes? 
the mullahs laughed when @barackobama asked iran to return our drone they will show it to china first.

real unemployment is 20%. we must simplify the tax code and start making our own products again to bring our jobs back from overseas. 

who handed iraq over to iran yesterday? @barackobama. we have gotten nothing from the iraqis we should have them pay us back with oil. 

don't forget my book signing tonight at costco on 1250 old country road in westbury, ny, from 6 8 pm. hope to see you there. 






a clip from my @foxandfriends interview discussing how newsmax @iontv debate is determining the gop primary pollshttp://huff.to/tldsob  
@barackobama has accumulated more debt in 3 years than the first 42 presidents combined. he is simply out of control. 
why did @barackobama let iran keep our drone? now it is going straight to the chinese. he should have taken it out. 
i was on a tele townhall with @teambachmann and hosted her 4 times in trump tower yet she declined the newsmax @iontv debate. no loyalty. 
donald trump, i think, would be fairer than a lot of the folks that have been moderating debates over the past few months. @ricksantorum 
china and opec were not mentioned in a single question in the @abc iowa debate this past saturday. wait for the newsmax @iontv debate 

if these guys have any integrity they'd say no to msnbc a network that few watch and is very negative. @andrewbreitbart re debate.

president reagan put it best: welfare's purpose should be to eliminate, as far as possible, the need for its own existence. 






@ronpaul is out of the newsmax @iontv debate. now there won't be any candidates who believe america caused 9.11 or iran should get nukes.

newly released emails prove that scientists have manipulated data on global warming. the data is unreliable.http://on.wsj.com/ukykym  




america's trade deficit with china is one of our greatest national security threats. time for fair trade. we must produce our own products. 
the banks were bailed out by us. they should start lending to private entrepreneurs. the banks are slowing american growth. 
my @foxandfriends interview from yesterdayhttp://bit.ly/vzo4gi  
in order to get elected, @barackobama will start a war with iran. 





third quarter gdp was lowered to 2% . there won't be any economic recovery until @barackobama is defeated. 
why does @barackobama support the radical islamists in egypt protests yet has such a high disregard for the tea party? 
washington will continue to run record deficits into the election. we are borrowing at a rate of $1.40 from china. truly unsustainable. 
iran will soon take all of the oil in iraq...and iraq itself keep the oil. 



american sanctions alone cannot stop iran's nuclear drive and @barackobama cannot get china and russia to agree on new iranian sanctions. 


i dictate my tweets to my executive assistant and she posts them. time is money the art of the deal. 

the habitual vacationer @barackobama spent 9 days before the critical super committee deadline traveling. he failed to lead, again. 

yesterday @barackobama actually spent a full day in washington. he didn't campaign, fund raise or play golf. shocking. 


egypt is turning into a hot bed of radical islam. the current protest is another coup attempt. we should never have abandoned mubarak. 
the house's failure to pass the balance budget amendment was another unforced error by the gop. very disappointing. 
when the super committee fails, @barackobama will get exactly what he really wants automatic cuts in defense spending. this is his plan. 
if @barackobama wanted the super committee to succeed, he would have lead. instead he has been campaigning. where is the leadership? 

the super committee is finding ways to raise all our taxes without admitting it. the republicans made a big mistake agreeing to this deal. 
obamacare is one of the greatest threats our country faces. it is unsustainable and will lead america into complete insolvency. 
@thedailyshow @lawrence panama is not a trump development. we only manage it after it is built. they also licensed the name. 

there was no need for violence at the ows protests. some are looking to make trouble. time to go home. 




regardless of the usc's ruling, obamacare can only be defeated politically. it must be legislatively repealed or america will go bankrupt. 


the stimulus is a net negative effect on the growth of gdp over 10 years as admitted by @barackobama's own cbohttp://bit.ly/vq075b  
@israel faces an existential threat in iran's nuclear drive. unfortunately @barackobama is no friend of israel. 

crude has skyrocketed since @barackobama delayed the keystone pipeline. not only are 20,000 jobs gone, but family budgets are tightening. 
the federal government has increased its employment by 12% since 2007. we need to stop replacing retired workers unless position is needed. 


in the span of two months @barackobama, the habitual vacationer, has called america soft and lazy. he loves to criticize america. 
iraq's army chief of staff is already seeking stronger ties with iran. once we leave, iran will take over iraq.http://bit.ly/ujzfv6  
@barackobama is obviously going to approve the keystone pipeline after the election if he wins. his supporters are being played.

“when mistakes are made, and they will be, the entrepreneur’s true character emerges and further growth takes place.” – the midas touch. 
waterboarding ksm gave us the intelligence that lead to bin laden. 

@barackobama has increased the epa budget by over 150%. the epa is an impediment to both growth and jobs. it sends jobs overseas. 



fewer americans are now insured through their employers due to higher premiums. obamacare must be fully repealed.http://bit.ly/vqxjng  

americans who can afford to buy enough food is now at a 3 year low. is this @barackobama’s ‘recovery’?http://bit.ly/sp4apx  
@barackobama, the habitual vacationer, called america lazy this past weekend while in hawaii. 


@barackobama made a campaign decision on delaying the keystone pipeline to 2013.the pipeline would lower oil prices and create jobs. 
october has a 7% foreclosure increase last month. is this @barackobama’s economic recovery? 
2012 is the most important election of my lifetime. @barackobama must be defeated. 
to the brave men and women, past and present, in our armed services best wishes on veterans day. 
the arab spring has turned into the islamist winter. our ally @israel is in a perilous position. we must stand behind @israel. 


the death tax should be abolished the government is simply taxing you twice. it is also a job killer. 

solyndra's government loan and subsequent bankruptcy prove that @barackobama is both corrupt and inept. 
the fed should not bail out the eu. europe's financial mess is their problem, not our problem 
herman cain handled the pressure of the debate really well. @thehermancain 
rick perry is a good guy who had a really tough evening. @rickperry 
mitt romney did great in the debate last night. 
the fannie and freddie execs should not get million dollar bonuses with our tax dollars. they were bailed out with $169b of our money. 

he is out of real solutions @barackobama's job bill is nothing more than a tax increase. 
the @supercommittee will fail. the republicans never should have agreed to the debt deal. 
instead of trash talking @pmisrael on the world stage, @barackobama should be defending @israel. 
america should not be pressuring @israel to show restraint against iran. we should be working to stop iran's nuclear drive. 
some @ows protesters are sincere people frustrated with the system others just in for the party. 
our deficits are caused by runaway spending, not inadequate taxing. washington does not have a revenue problem. 
the federal government spent over $3.7 trillion last year. this is unsustainable and a true danger. the american dream is being destroyed. 

a record high 6.7% of americans are living in extreme poverty. this is tragic. we can do better. 
reporter @alhunt is one boring and low vision guy 


iran's quest for nuclear weapons is a major threat to our nation's national security interests. we can't allow iran to go nuclear. 
malfeasance at fannie mae and freddie mac helped cause our current financial meltdown. 

watch my interview with greta van susteren @gretawire tonight on fox news at 10 p.m. 
the oil companies collude with opec to keep oil artificially overvalued. they need to be reigned in. 
the greatest threat to our security is our debt. it is already past 100% gdp. we need to make real budget cuts. 
the economy won't fully recover until @obamacare is fully repealed. it is a job killer 
egypt's muslim brotherhood just made its first visit to hamas led gaza. why did @barackobama promote the arab spring ? 

the @supercommittee must cut spending, not raise taxes. washington has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. 
another company that the doe has given money to just filed for bankruptcy. this is how the money we borrow at 40% from china is wasted. 

the republicans never should have agreed to this past summer's debt deal. military cuts will now come along with tax increases. 

it snowed over 4 inches this past weekend in new york city. it is still october. so much for global warming. 
the al qaeda flag is now flying over benghazi. @barackobama spent over $3billion of our money for this? 


our economy cannot stay competitive with policies like these: @barackobama is proposing over $90 billion in new regulations. 
obamacare contains marriage penalty taxes. why should married couples be penalized for having healthcare?

my interview yesterday with @teamcavuto discussing europe's debt deal and the gop primaryhttp://bit.ly/rxiwdb  
the us air force won the war in libya to clear the way for islamic extremist control of libya. 
our worst threat to unemployment is @obamacare. it will also destroy our country's basic standards. 
when will our nation's sacrifices be respectfully appreciated? iraq and libya should reimburse us in oil. 
the debt is our nation's greatest threat. @barackobama is out of touch. 
watch me tonight at 9pm et on @cnn, full hour. @piersmorgan won @apprenticenbc before taking over larry king's slot should be interesting. 
why aren't we getting any oil from iraq before we leave? we are leaving the country wide open for iran. big mistake. 
when will washington stand up to china. china is manipulating its currency and stealing our jobs. washington should move on legislation. 
i am happy to see the majority of the gop candidates agree with me that the tax code must be simplified and the rates dropped. 
my @foxnews interview last night with @gretawirehttp://bit.ly/uwuatb  

read this about @lawrence....http://nyti.ms/qcskxw  
i heard, because his show is unwatchable, that @lawrence has made many false statements last night about me. maybe i should sue him? 
watch me tonight on fox news at 10 p.m. with greta van susteren, @gretawire. 
the 2012 election is the most important in my lifetime. we must nominate a candidate who will win and will roll back @barackobama's damage. 

stop calling my office to do your show, i have more important things to do with my time nobody's watching you @lawrence 

it's sad with only 57,000 followers on twitter that you are topping your broadcast. @lawrence 
please only respond by tweet @lawrence because like everyone else, i don't watch your show. 
@lawrence there is no such thing they can't get much lower than yours. 
@lawrence yes, great hair, and it's actually mine. 
does @barackobama ever work? he is constantly campaigning and fundraising on both the taxpayer's dime and time not fair 



libya is adopting a more radical form of sharia law now under their new leadership. is this what @barackobama wanted? 
so much for creating american jobs @barackobama gave $529 million to a green car company so they can be manufactured in finland. 
the job plan by @barackobama is nothing more than a second stimulus. the first failed and so will this one. 

we are leaving iraq after expending a tremendous amount of blood and treasure. we should be reimbursed with oil don't give it to iran. 
the dollar is at an all time wwii low against the yen. the fed's recklessness is going to lead to record inflation. 
why do we continue to sit idly by while china steals our national security and corporate secrets? china is an enemy, not a friend. 
the misery index is at a 28 year high. 
why did @barackobama liberate libya and do nothing for the iranian protestors? iran is a threat to our national security. 
a simplified tax code will help promote growth in the private sector. 
why did we spend billions of our money on libya if we are not going to get any of the country's oil? what do we get out of this? 
why is crude oil priced at $86/barrel? opec is ripping us off. not worth $30/barrel. america needs new leaders. 

the ows protesters are doing nothing to advance the interests of the 99%. time for them to go home 
@barackobama claims that all his choices were the right ones. i am sure the 20% of americans who are unemployed disagree. 
bob beckel, a commentator for fox is bad for the @foxnews brand: @bobbeckel is close to incompetent.

my beautiful wife melania will be appearing on qvc this evening from 8 to 9 pm.

my @foxnews interview last night on @hannityshow discussing ows and @barackobama's incompetent leadership.http://bit.ly/qum5hz  
our country is blowing up and @barackobama is out campaigning. 
everyone makes mistakes, but it's what you do with them and what you learn from them that matters. midas touch 
iraq's government is treating us like fools. we should demand their oil. 
if obamacare is not repealed then we can expect stagnant growth, long term unemployment and record high premiums. 


iran was planning to attack the israeli and saudi dc embassies. we should respond accordingly. the diplomatic window is closed. 
@barackobama is holding taiwan's request for 66 advanced f 16's. wrong message to send to china. 
it is time for iran to face serious consequences. this regime is a threat to our national security. 
late last friday @barackobama announced his 2011 budget deficit was $1.299 trillion the second largest in us history. 
@johnboehner: stop the china curse pass the china currency bill 
happy to have passed 800,000 followers. looking forward to passing 1m sooner than later. 
why is @barackobama always campaigning or on vacation? 

china's military buildup is a major threat to the free world. we must remain resolute and maintain our national defense at all costs. 
be sure to watch my wonderful wife melania trump tonight on @qvc at 1am est 


if the wall street protesters are upset about the economy then they should really be protesting @barackobama at the white house. 
stop the china curse pass the chinese currency bill 


tune in tonight to greta van susteren's show, on the record, which airs on fox news at 9 p.m. 
mitt romney is right about the chinese rip off of america. 
the debate was very interesting last night. there were numerous winners and governor romney did very well. 
when will @barackobama release an actual budget? 
i don't want to be the only billionaire in america i want all americans to be rich. 
if the prez wants to create jobs talk to some business people not liberal intellectuals. 
the only way to spread economic growth is to lower taxes and end unfriendly regulatory practices. 
the fed's reckless monetary policy is going to create record inflation. 
new study shows 80% of congress have no business experience it shows 
a guy named @bobbeckel on fox, their resident liberal, was not born with much of a brain. 
i have traveled the world. america is the most beautiful country on earth. 
the only job @barackobama cares about is his own. everything he does is for his own reelection. 
when will we stop wasting our money on rebuilding afghanistan? we must rebuild our country first. 
the gop primary schedule is a disaster. not enough time. 

@barackobama is trying to pass another stimulus after the first was a complete failure. does he really believe we are that stupid? 
why is the un condemning @israel and doing nothing about syria? what a disgrace. 
in order to save medicare and stop record premium increases we must repeal obamacare. 
washington is wasting over $2 billion this year on solyndra type loans. yet they want to cut military spending. 
china is threatening washington over the currency bill. we should pass it immediately. 
@barackobama sold guns to the mexican drug cartels. they were used in the murders of americans . where is the outrage? 
@barackobama now says that he is an underdog in 2012. america should be so lucky. we still need a solid candidate. 
our national debt has grown by 30% and a gallon of gas has doubled so far under @barackobama. he is a disaster. 
the democrats in the super committee want to raise taxes first in deficit talks. huge mistake. cut wasteful spending first. 

great meeting with @thehermancain yesterday in trump tower. great guy 
looking forward to visiting the trump vineyard estates today in charlottesville, va, for a press conference and the grand opening. 

i was on cnn last night with @erinburnett.

it's about time italy recognized the innocence of @amandaknox great news 


@thecelebrityapprentice cast is set the best we've ever had. shooting starts in 2 weeks airs in february. 
@usgovernment has done nothing to help @amandaknox. 
@amandaknox is innocent. italian government should pay for this travesty. 
sadly, vanity fair is a rapidly dying magazine. needs new blood and fast going the way of spy magazine. 
the unemployment numbers are tragic. we are letting the world take our jobs. it has to stop 
@barackobama said yesterday that we have gone soft. how can the world respect us when our own president doesn't? 
how many more billions of dollars will @barackobama continue to waste in these solar companies? 
everyone should boycott italy if amanda knox is not freed she is totally innocent. 
@jonhuntsman called to set up a meeting. haven't returned his call. 

my interview yesterday with @myfoxnyhttp://bit.ly/qexyik  

a simplified tax code would spur economic growth and help create jobs. unfortunately, washington is incapable of simplifying anything. 
the only way for medicare and social security to remain solvent is if our economy is healthy. @barackobama doesn't get it. 
the iranians have just threatened to send warships to our coasts. they laugh at us. we can't allow them to develop nuclear weapons. 
the fed's reckless policies of low interest and flooding the market with dollars needs to be stopped or we will face record inflation. 
china does not negotiate from a position of strength, we simply negotiate against ourselves. we have all the advantages but don't execute. 
my @foxnews interview from yesterday discussing my recent meetings in trump tower and also @govchristiehttp://bit.ly/qmuuux  
really bad ratings for lawrence o'donnell on msnbc o'reilly is killing him 
@jonhuntsman has zero chance of getting the nomination. whoever said i wanted to meet him? time is money and i don't waste mine. 
the @erictrumpfdn golf invitational featuring a performance by @bretmichaels was a great event. enjoy the video....http://bit.ly/pfw6pi  
when will @barackobama present an actual budget? enough with the games. 
sleepy chuck todd of nbc falls far short of the late great tim russert. 
china is stealing our jobs. we need to demand china stop manipulating its currency and end its rampant corporate espionage. 

obamacare must be completely repealed. a recent report from ubs shows that it is the number one reason employers are not hiring. 

happy new year to all my jewish friends. 

it seems @barackobama had our tax dollars buy guns for mexican drug lords that were used to kill americans. we need answers now.

my @foxnews interview from last night with @gretawire discussing yesterday's meeting with @mittromneyhttp://bit.ly/qdvtu2  


our country's debt crisis cannot be solved by tax increases. we must cut government spending. 
obama care’s taxes vest in 2014. conveniently after the 2012 election. coincidence? 

our deficit spending is china’s gain. @barackobama is bankrupting our country. 
i couldn't make the faith and freedom confab in orlando so i sent a video...http://bit.ly/nv99vz  

government waste, fraud and abuse should be immediately addressed. this will help solve our deficit crisis both short and long term. 
@erictrump is doing a great job on completing our new trump winery in virginia. 
@barackobama's jobs plan sure looks like a tax increase plan to me. 
australia is a beautiful country with terrific people who love america. 
china is neither an ally or a friend they want to beat us and own our country. 
our next president must stop china's rip off of america. 

rick perry is right when he says we must stand by israel in the un. 
obamacare will destroy small business the backbone of america's economy. 
if you're going to think think big the art of the deal 
sorry i will miss the cpac gathering in orlando there in spirit obama must go. 

i find it really hard to listen to @barackobama's speeches. he doesn't have a clue. 
it seems there is never a problem for which @barackobama cannot find a reason for another speech and another tax. 

how will raising taxes create jobs? washington is all out of answers. new leadership is needed. 
i am increasingly concerned with the un's ploy against @israel this coming week and will monitor all events closely from australia. 

if china had a tenth of the natural resources we do then they would already be energy independent. instead we continue to buy oil from opec. 

it doesn't cost any money to think bigger. the art of the deal 
@barackobama great job on solyndra. you are some extremely skilled venture capitalist. stick to the memoirs and speeches. 
@barackobama honored and excited to be listed on @attackwatch. thanks. btw where are the jobs? donald. 
i applaud @netanyahu for announcing that he will show up at the un to defend @israel. a true us friend and great leader. 
we can create jobs in the american economy by protecting our own manufacturing sector. 
can you imagine if @barackobama had passed cap and trade? energy costs would be double from already record highs. 
the solyndra scandal @barackobama's $500million photo op. he loves wasting our money. 

had dinner with @rickperry last night great guy, straight shooter, impressive record. 
third gun linked to 'fast and furious' identified at border agent's murder scene. when will the white house come clean? 
@barackobama's job bill contains the word 'tax' over 330 times that will sure work 

bob turner great guy, great businessman, will be a great congressman. was happy to help him win. 
i'm looking forward to seeing you all this afternoon at macy's herald square. 5:30 pm at the crystal department on 8. 
@barackobama will hear loud and clear today the message ny 9 is sending by electing @bobturner9th @israel is our friend and ally. 


the white house is continuing to be openly uncooperative with the fast and furious investigation. american lives were lost. we need answers. 

how can the economy ever recover when @barackobama keeps threatening the private sector with more taxes. this is no way to spur growth. 
i'm urging my friends in brooklyn to vote for bob turner tomorrow send @barackobama a message. 
friends in ny 9, let @barackobama know that you don't approve of his mistreatment of @israel. vote for @bobturner9th tomorrow 
the american economy would grow if washington didn’t keep threatening higher taxes and more regulations. government is not the solution. 


the world economic forum now ranks the us the fifth most competitive economy in the world. we have fallen from first under @barackobama. 
iran’s nuclear program must be stopped – by any and all means necessary. 
very exciting. i will be at macy’s herald square this wednesday at 5:30pm to celebrate the launch of trump home crystal 
want jobs? slash corporate tax rate. tax incentives for companies that create jobs in us. america will boom. 
@barackobama the stimulus will fail, just like the first. 
i watched potus speech from europe same old tax and spend won't create jobs. 
@ivankatrump always makes me proudhttp://bit.ly/pwz8xi  
why is the un planning to attack @israel's sovereignty and ignore iran's nuclear program? the us should look at future funding. 
china is happy to learn that @barackobama plans to borrow another $300 billion. @barackobama is their favorite client. 
if only speeches could create jobs then @barackobama wouldn't have such a dismal economic record. 

my interview with @gretawire last night on @foxnews: @barackobama 'missed his opportunity'http://bit.ly/otjwin  
america needs a tough negotiator not a community organizer. 
why was @barackobama selling guns to mexican drug dealers? 
a robust growing economy is how to fix social security and medicare not cuts on seniors. 
us should have told libya rebels give us 50% of your oil for our military support. 

@barackobama trillion $ stimulus was supposed to create jobs instead it gave us more debt and higher unemployment. 

@barackobama wishes speeches could create jobs. his job is costing america all of ours. 
fast and furious gun running goes all the way to the white house. we need answers now 
oil is double the price now compared to last year opec is laughing at @barackobama. 
fast and furious put semi automatics in the hands of mexican drug lords that killed americans @barackobama should answer all questions. 
the white house is predicting 9% unemployment throughout 2012 – and when obama care takes effect in 2014 expect it to go even higher. 
make no mistake fast and furious goes all the way to the white house. 
@barackobama is so inept that i think he simply made a mistake in originally scheduling the joint session on september 7th. just sad. 

we must stand firm against the un's ploy to sabotage israel if the un grants the pa statehood then we must immediately defund it. 
i'll be on greta van susteren's show tonight at 10 pm on foxnews. tune in. 

libya is being taken over by islamic radicals with @barackobama's open support. 

china's business interests reach far and wide even domestically within our borders. we need to reassess our relationship. 
the new libyan government should turn over the lockerbie bomber now. 
obamacare must be fully repealed or it will destroy america's small businesses. 
if the un unilaterally grants the palestinians statehood, then the us should cut off all its funding. actions have consequences. 
if the palestinians want statehood then why are they run by the terrorist group hamas? 
crude is at $85 right now – isn’t even worth half that. opec is ripping us off. 
@barackobama must release a budget before @johnboehner begins negotiations on a continuing appropriations resolution. 

libyan rebels should have given us 50% of the oil in return for our military support we don't even ask 

more and more americans seem fed up with both parties i agree. 
there is no substitute for private sector experience. 
why did @barackobama and his family travel separately to martha's vineyard? they love to extravagantly spend on the taxpayers' dime. 

america needs a president who can negotiate better deals for the american people. 
china's corporate espionage is a continued threat to the american economy. with the right leadership, it can be stopped. 
@barackobama inherited $10.6 trillion in national debt will leave after his first term with the debt at over $17.6 trillion. 
there usually is an easy solution to every problem. for instance, a lot of our country's problems can be solved in next year's election. 
we have spent over $1 billion on the libya operation. what are we getting back? 

as bad as qaddafi was what comes next in libya will be worse just watch. 
let's not start celebrating over libya until we see who takes over. 
we spent over a billion on libya and lead the way why is europe getting the oil? 
@ronpaul has some serious ideas which deserve serious consideration. wrong for media to ignore him. 
we don't need another stimulus. the first one was a complete failure. why repeat the same mistake? 

israel is being barraged by rockets from gaza recently. they must respond accordingly in defense of their citizens. 
@barackobama is sure a master delegator. he has sent @joe_biden to china. the chinese are laughing at us. we must do better. 
@barackobama’s new job plan will certainly do the following – 1. not create any jobs. 2. borrow more money from china.  

insurgents in iraq show they can still mount horrifying attacks us wastes trillions. 
many people have been asking to see my plane, the apprentice's @amandatmiller will give you a tour...http://bit.ly/qtiqo6  
karl rove lost gop both houses of congress and the white house gave us obama. 

ron paul is right when he says we are wasting lives and money in iraq and afghanistan. 
my interview with @gretawire on fox news for those who missed it 'obama's constantly on vacation'http://bit.ly/qr8ara  
@barackobama has a record low 39% gallup approval rating. why so high? 

amazing obama speaks, market goes down trump tells cnbc he's buying stock market goes up should not be that way 



china is a threat to america. they are not our friend. 
unemployment is plaguing both black and hispanic youths. very troubling. 

@barackobama played golf yesterday. now he heads to a 10 day vacation in martha's vineyard. nice work ethic. 
reporters say it's the trump bump i tell cnbc i am buying stocks and the market goes up. 
economic growth can save social security, medicare and america. 
mike huckebee, a great guy, said the president should appoint me treasury secretary. china and opec would not be happy. 
ron paul is right that we are wasting trillions of dollars in iraq and afghanistan. 
obama has no understanding of how to create jobs or opportunity. he believes in government. 
it's easy to see why americans are sick of career politicians and both parties. 
how will mitt romney defend his record on jobs and romneycare in tonight's debate? 
looking forward to the gop debate and the outcome of the ames straw poll. we must get a real leader. 


the fed continues to flood the market with us dollars. wrong move. 
oil is starting to rise again despite the horrible times. opec continues to rip us off. not worth $30. new leadership needed. 
congress should get back to washington, but @barackobama doesn't want to interrupt his vacation in martha's vineyard. 







the s&p downgrade is a direct result of @barackobama's increased reckless budget spending and obama care. he owns this. 

obama care is already having a devastating impact on our economy. 


america's debt officially became 100% of our gdp on @barackobama's 50th birthday coincidence? 

thanks to giovanni's coal fire pizza of florida for donating enough pizza to feed 750 police athletic league youngsters in ny this friday. 
watch my interview with greta van susteren on her show, on the record, tonight on fox news in the 10 p.m. hour. 

morning joe panel is stealing many of my statements and ideas to better america without giving credit the story of my life 
republicans gave obama a free pass to the white house they just don't get it. 
i believe america can be great only with proper leadership. 
wake up america china is eating our lunch. 
all those politicians in washington and not one good negotiator. 

no taxes the only good thing about dc debt deal. 

the more you learn about the debt deal, the worse it gets. 

republicans and democrats have both created our economic problems. 
why should we have any defense cuts in any deal? america must remain strong. 
this is the best deal the republicans could get? 
disappointed in gop and dems giving obama power to raise the debt limit next year is a mistake. 
ex presidential pollster pat cadell says most voters sick of both parties and their failure. 
we need economic growth and jobs not blue ribbon panels to study the problem. 
no taxes in boehner or reid plan important victory for america. 
watched sean hannity last night a great guy. 
if obama has to re fight this fight next year he loses watch the fine details in every deal the art of the deal 
blue ribbon commission to find and agree to future spending cuts? bad idea. 
never quit and always hit back the art of the comeback 
i just got mike leach's new book, swing your sword. he's a great coach, and he's written a great book. it's definitely worth reading. 

@barackobama has not released his own debt plan yet. he's totally lost, ineffective, desperate. gop has its best chance to make a great deal 
my wife melania trump's show was a tremendous success last night. in case you missed her, you can see her again tonight on @qvc at 7 pm et 
@johnboehner the worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. the art of the deal 

@karlrove's @crossroadsgps new ad criticizes obama for his excessive spending and debt, borrowing from china. didn't bush do the same thing? 

people ask me every day to pose for pictures but the camera never works the first time they are never prepared or maybe just very nervous 
know when to walk away from the table. the art of the deal 
watch my wife melania trump tonight on @qvc at 1 a.m. so proud of her 
higher taxes kill job creation cut wild government spending and waste. 
china has so much of our debt that they can't put us in default w/o killing themselves us needs our toughest negotiator and fast 
america's debt is greater than our gdp. time for new thinking. 


fiscal mismanagement of cash costing us taxpayer billions cut fraud and waste before cutting funding for seniors. 
obama, sadly, has no business or private sector background and it shows. 

the answer to both social security and medicare is a robust growing economy not cuts on the elderly. 
we need a balanced budget amendment because congress has no fiscal discipline. 
unfortunately@barackobama's continued attack on the us $ will lead to ever rising gas prices at the pump and lots of other really bad things 
ronald kessler's new book the secrets of the fbi is a great book that should be read by everyone. 
increasing america’s debt weakens us domestically and internationally. us senator @barackobama, 2007 

the gang of six yet another unmitigated disaster. any deal needs to repeal obamacare. t e a. 
china is our enemy they want to destroy us redstate interview 
obama is addicted to spending america into insolvency. his record proves it. 
robust economic growth is the answer to the medicare problem not cuts on the elderly. 
while @barackobama seeks to further destroy our credit, our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. such a total failure as a president. 
@johnboehner @ericcantor you can't con people...if you don't deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on. the art of the deal 
so china is ordering us to raise the debt limit...how low have we as a nation sunk? 
the gop doesn't waste an opportunity to waste an opportunity. defunding obamacare should be central to any deal. 
every dollar @barackobama spends costs $1.40 with interest borrowed from china on our children and grandchildren's backs. cut cap balance 
@barackobama has sold guns to mexican drug lords while his doj erodes our 2nd amendment rights. 

congratulations to my daughter ivanka and her husband jared on the birth of their daughter arabella rose yesterday. 
@marcorubio is right. we need to create more taxpayers, not more taxes. cut, cap and balance.http://onforb.es/pbvguq  
@barackobama you have increased discretionary spending by 25% annually and amassed over $4 trillion in debt. t e ahttp://on.wsj.com/onsy3b  

what is better advice the art of the deal or rules for radicals ? i know which one @barackobama prefers. 
cut, cap and balance. taxed enough already 

us news named the top10 best hotels in the us and trump int'l hotel & tower nyc and trump int'l hotel & tower chicago are on the list 
@barackobama you have abandoned israel and engaged the muslim brotherhood, and even the arab world does not like ithttp://politi.co/qutxsa  

my interview last night with greta on the gop going el foldohttp://bit.ly/oprtzh  
@johnboehner debt ceiling sometimes no deal is better than a bad deal. 

@macmiller donald trump the song gets 16m hits on youtube. who wouldn't be flattered? 
@johnboehner much as it pays to emphasize the positive, there are times when the only choice is confrontation. the art of the deal 
@johnboehner mr. speaker, bring the balanced budget amendment to the floor for a vote let's get the ball rolling. 


house gop wants to cut medicare, obama took $500 billion from medicare for obamacare. both wrong 


@johnboehner message for house gop the worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. the art of the deal. 
if only @obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening israel's borders then america would be on the path to solvency. 
the art of the deal the best thing you can do is deal from strength, and leverage is the biggest strength you have. cut, cap and balance. 
republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @barackobama in today's debt talks first and foremost cut,cap and balance. 
congress is back.time to cut, cap and balance.there is no revenue problem.the debt limit cannot be raised until obama spending is contained. 
perhaps this is the kind of thinking we need in washington ...http://on.wsj.com/ldleoy
