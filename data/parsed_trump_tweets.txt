Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP 32 2 MILLION  CLINTON 27 8 MILLION  Thank you 

Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania  It would be a major media event @CNN @FoxNews 
NATO commander agrees members should pay up via @dcexaminer:http://www washingtonexaminer com/nato commander agrees members should pay up/article/2598183 custom_click=rss … 
Wow  NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS  This is a general I will like 
The Rust Belt was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico  END 
Crooked's stop in Johnstown  Pennsylvania  where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians  drew less than 200 with Bill  VP 

Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania  Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA  
I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch  Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics  they will do much better 
Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two Big Thursdays when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches Republican's won ratings 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime  supports open borders  and wants massive tax hikes  A formula for disaster 
Violent crime is rising across the United States  yet the DNC convention ignored it  Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities  
Just got back from Colorado  The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible  Big crowds 


American homeownership rate in Q2 2016 was 62 9% lowest rate in 51yrs  WE will bring back the 'American Dream 'pic twitter com/yI4Q8FHRjp 
We are suffering through the worst long term unemployment in the last 70 years  I want change Crooked Hillary Clinton does not  
Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters  Her foreign wars  NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes  
Colorado was amazing yesterday So much support  Our tax  trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country  


As usual  Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games  Same as last time w/ Bernie  Unacceptable 

Hillary Clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts  





What Bernie Sanders really thinks of Crooked Hillary Clinton pic twitter com/VgMaAsZBep 
I am watching Crooked Hillary speak  Same old stuff  our country needs change 
Wow  my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary  She sold them out  V P  pick 

The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech  He wishes he didn't make that deal 

Crooked Hillary said that I couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign  Really I just beat 16 people and am beating her 

Little Michael Bloomberg  who never had the guts to run for president  knows nothing about me  His last term as Mayor was a disaster 

Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech  Many of her statements were lies and fabrications 

@AnnCoulter: I believe in science Dem code for we're shutting down coal mines  steel plants and any other remaining manufacturing 

Two policemen just shot in San Diego  one dead  It is only getting worse  People want LAW AND ORDER 
Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me  and forgot to mention the many problems of our country  in her very average scream 
The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke  @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD 
No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes  
Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction  terrorism and ISIS across the world  
Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power  no jobs  no safety  
Hillary will never reform Wall Street  She is owned by Wall Street 
Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words  
Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam  as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees  is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country  




Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office  It will only go further down under Clinton  
A vote for Clinton Kaine is a vote for TPP  NAFTA  high taxes  radical regulation  and massive influx of refugees  




@trumplican2016: @realDonaldTrump @DavidWohl stay the course mr trump your message is resonating with the PEOPLE 

Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty  violence and despair  
Shooting deaths of police officers up 78% this year  We must restore law and order and protect our great law enforcement officers 






If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33 000 illegally deleted emails  perhaps they should share them with the FBI 

Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining then a small one  Pathetic 
Our not very bright Vice President  Joe Biden  just stated that I wanted to carpet bomb the enemy  Sorry Joe  that was Ted Cruz 
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about  The danger is massive  NO 
Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally  Get tough 
The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country  No recognition SAD 
Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said Trump is a genius  America 1st 
As I have been saying  Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election  despite her statements to the contrary: top adv  
Just like I have warned from the beginning  Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP http://www politico com/story/2016/07/terry mcauliffe hillary clinton tpp trade 226253 … 
Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena  Did Bernie go home and go to sleep  
I hate to say it  but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention 
No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it  the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible  Highly overrated 
You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is  and neither does ISIS (a good thing)  Please get your facts straight thanks  @megynkelly 
For the record  I have ZERO investments in Russia  
In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster  the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump  Crazy 

Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here  
Bernie's exhausted  he just wants to shut down and go home to bed 
The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar 



Pocahontas bombed last night Sad to watch  
Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS  bad trade deals  broken borders  police and law and order  The Republican Convention was great 
Funny  if you listen to @FoxNews  the Democrats did not have a good day  If you listen to the other two  they are fawning  What a difference 
Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton  All of that work  energy and money  and nothing to show for it Waste of time  
Elizabeth Warren  often referred to as Pocahontas  just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary  who she always hated 
Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution  We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs  
If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party  they have no future I know more about Cory than he knows about himself  
I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me  I said fine  He then trashes on air 
Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold  He got NOTHING for all of the time  energy and money  The V P  a joke 
While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people  we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers  
Clinton betrayed Bernie voters  Kaine supports TPP  is in pocket of Wall Street  and backed Iraq War  





The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE 
Wow  the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess  But fear not  the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn 
Here we go again with another Clinton scandal  and e mails yet (can you believe)  Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in  B never had a chance 
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the DNC they just got caught  that's all They laughed at Bernie  
If Bernie Sanders  after seeing the just released e mails  continues to look exhausted and done  then his legacy will never be the same  

Hillary was involved in the e mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened 
How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e mails  using even religion  against Bernie 
The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e mails  which should never have been written (stupid)  because Putin likes me 
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes  No way they are going to fix America's problems  ISIS & all others laughing 
The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good  but for the final night  my speech  great  Thank you 
The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that  after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory  she's out 
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing E mails say the rigged system is alive & well 
Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength  I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook 
Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top  DWS  Too bad Bernie flamed out 
If the Republican Convention had blown up with e mails  resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player  (Bernie)  media would go wild 
The @CNN panels are so one sided  almost all against Trump  @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher  Don't watch CNN 
I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated  The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted  no energy left 
Today proves what I have always known  that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one  not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets ) 
Sorry folks  but Bernie Sanders is exhausted  just can't go on any longer  He is trying to dismiss the new e mails and DNC disrespect  SAD 
There is no longer a Bernie Sanders political revolution  He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure wants it all to end 
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates  
Looks like the Bernie people will fight  If not  their BLOOD  SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time  Kaine stands for opposite 
Wow  President Obama's brother  Malik  just announced that he is voting for me  Was probably treated badly by president like everybody else 
Bernie Sanders started off strong  but with the selection of Kaine for V P   is ending really weak  So much for a movement TOTAL DISRESPECT 
The Crooked Hillary V P  choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters  Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H 

@NancyNielsenn: @realDonaldTrump Dinesh D'Sousa Hillary's America  see it 

Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night  From the heart 
The Wikileaks e mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her  unless he is a fraud 
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together  ISIS and our other enemies are drooling  They don't look presidential to me 
I will bring jobs back and get wages up  People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years  Clinton killed jobs 
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved  Job killer 
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs  I will bring jobs back 
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania  Against steelworkers and miners  Husband signed NAFTA  
Leaked e mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders  Mock his heritage and much more  On line from Wikileakes  really vicious  RIGGED 
Pocahontas wanted V P  slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate  Also  Crooked Hillary hates her 
Tim Kaine is  and always has been  owned by the banks  Bernie supporters are outraged  was their last choice  Bernie fought for nothing 
The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine  who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for  Philly fight  

I highly recommend the just out book THE FIELD OF FIGHT by General Michael Flynn  How to defeat radical Islam  
Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did  
Another attack  this time in Germany  Many killed  God bless the people of Munich  
One of the best produced  including the incredible stage & set  in the history of conventions  Great unity Big T V  ratings @KarlRove 
Thank you Cleveland  We love you and will be back many times 
What a great four days in Cleveland  So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all  The police and Secret Service were fantastic 





Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses  the party is VERY united  Great love in the arena 
Ted Cruz talks about the Constitution but doesn't say that if the Dems win the Presidency  the new JUSTICES appointed will destroy us all 
I am soooo proud of my children  Don  Eric and Tiffany their speeches  under enormous pressure  were incredible  Ivanka intros me tonight 


Arena was packed  totally electric 
 @mike_pence was fantastic tonight  Will be a great V P  

Wow  Ted Cruz got booed off the stage  didn't honor the pledge I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway  No big deal 


Thank you to Governor @ScottWalker for such warm support  Great speech 



John Kasich was never asked by me to be V P  Just arrived in Cleveland will be a great two days 

The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails  
Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press 
In November  I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state  Jobs 
Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena  More than in past years  
Congratulations to my children  Don and Tiffany  on having done a fantastic job last night  I am very proud of you 
Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States  I will work hard and never let you down AMERICA FIRST 
The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention  Very exciting 


@RoxaneTancredi: Democrats are coming to TRUMP  I used to be proud of the dem party  No more It is crooked and not for the people  



Networks other than low ratings @CNN have been very fair and exciting 
 @CNN is the worst They go to their dumb  one sided panels when a podium speaker is for Trump VAST MAJORITY want: Make America Great Again 
Looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife  Melania  Place looks beautiful 

President Obama just had a news conference  but he doesn't have a clue  Our country is a divided crime scene  and it will only get worse 
Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching  We are not looking good  we are not looking smart  we are not looking tough 

I will be on @60Minutes tonight at 7:00 P M  with Mike Pence talking about LAW AND ORDER and many other subjects Bad times for divided USA 
We are TRYING to fight ISIS  and now our own people are killing our police  Our country is divided and out of control  The world is watching 

The ratings at @FoxNews blow away the ratings of @CNN not even close  That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like 
 @FoxNews is much better  and far more truthful  than @CNN  which is all negative  Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary I don't watch  
If Goofy Elizabeth Warren  a very weak Senator  didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today  Pick her H 
I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren  sometimes referred to as Pocahontas  as her V P  Then we can litigate her fraud 
It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience  look at all of the bad decisions she has made  Bernie said she has bad judgement 
As the days and weeks go by  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions 
We are going to have a great time in Cleveland  Will lead to special results for our country  We will Make America Great Again 
Goofy Elizabeth Warren  who may be the least productive Senator in the U S  Senate  must prove she is not a fraud  Without the con it's over 
Thank you to Jack Morgan  Tamara Neo  Cheryl Ann Kraft and all of my friends and supporters in Virginia  GREAT JOB 

Thank you to Chris Cox and Bikers for Trump Your support has been amazing  I will never forget  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street  lobbyists and special interests  She will sell our country down the tubes 
Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes  Crooked Hillary Clinton  can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money 
Crooked Hillary  who embarrassed herself and the country with her e mail lies  has been a DISASTER on foreign policy  Look what's happening 
Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience  yet look what her policies have done 
Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana)  My first choice from start 
Look forward to Governor Mike Pence V P  introduction tomorrow in New York City  
I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate  News conference tomorrow at 11:00 A M  
Four more years of weakness with a Crooked Hillary Administration is not acceptable  Look what has happened to the world with O & Hillary 

My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice  France  We are with you in every way 
In light of the horrible attack in Nice  France  I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement  
Another horrific attack  this time in Nice  France  Many dead and injured  When will we learn  It is only getting worse  
I employ many people in the State of Virginia JOBS  JOBS  JOBS Crooked Hillary will sell us out  just like her husband did with NAFTA  


I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan  Details to follow  
If I win the Presidency  we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions 
Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach  What was she thinking  
Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct  Big mistake by an incompetent judge 
On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party  I am spending a lot myself and also helping others  
Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity  

Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common pic twitter com/teoVCYXKOR 
Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves  Think about it and let me know 
The Republican platform is most pro Israel of all time 
New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall  We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN 



Justice Ginsburg of the U S  Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me  Her mind is shot resign 


I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 8pm  Enjoy 

To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests  we welcome you with open arms  People first  
Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro war pro TPP pro Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton  
Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs  

I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters  They are not happy that he is selling out 
Bernie Sanders  who has lost most of his leverage  has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton  He will endorse her today fans angry 

For too many years  our inner cities have been left behind  I am going to deliver jobs  safety and protection for those in need  
Crime is out of control  and rapidly getting worse  Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities  Not good 

Senior United States District Judge Robert E  Payne today ruled in favor of Trump campaign delegates who had argued  https://www facebook com/DonaldTrump/posts/10157294436575725 … 


Thoughts and prayers with the victims  and their families along with everyone at the Berrien County Courthouse in St  Joseph  Michigan  

I heard that the underachieving John King of @CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies  Happily  few people are watching dead network 
The media is so dishonest  If I make a statement  they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish They think the public is stupid 
President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think  He is living in a world of the make believe 
Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton  We are a divided nation 

Way to go @serenawilliams you are a true champion  Proud of you 

Isn't it sad that on a day of national tragedy Hillary Clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on @CNN  
Due to the horrific events taking place in our country  I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity today in Miami  
Last night's horrific execution style shootings of 12 Dallas law enforcement officers   https://www facebook com/DonaldTrump/posts/10157277205810725 … 
Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country 
After today  Crooked Hillary can officially be called Lyin' Crooked Hillary  



Just leaving D C  Had great meetings with Republicans in the House and Senate  Very interesting day These are people who love our country 



Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow  Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live  
I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton  Check it out Sleepy Eyes  @MarkHalperin @NBCPolitics 
Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd  a man with so little touch for politics  is at it again He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N C  
Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A C  Others to follow  Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City  
Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves Convention Center  Airport and destroyed City 
I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago  great timing (as all know)  Pols made big mistakes  now many bankruptcies  
Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country  She is sooooo guilty  But watch  her time will come 
The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges  but   https://www facebook com/DonaldTrump/videos/10157263351880725/ …pic twitter com/8CBSfNpl2l 
Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest  incompetent and of very bad judgement  
Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive  highly classified information  Not fit 
Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U S  Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong  BAD JUDGEMENT 
I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with murder  Come November 8  she's out 
Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party  There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning  Lots of support Win 
I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 11pm  Enjoy 
My son  @EricTrump will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on @FoxNews  Enjoy 
Looking forward to meeting with @SenBobCorker in a little while  We will be traveling to North Carolina together today  

The system is rigged  General Petraeus got in trouble for far less  Very very unfair As usual  bad judgment  
It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday  She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U S  Will see her again 
Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary  A total disgrace 
On @FoxNews at 7:00 P M  Special: Meet the Trumps Hope you enjoy 
Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary  She is flying with him tomorrow  Who pays  
With Hillary and Obama  the terrorist attacks will only get worse  Politically correct fools  won't even call it what it is RADICAL ISLAM 
Crooked Hillary Clinton is guilty as hell but the system is totally rigged and corrupt Where are the 33 000 missing e mails  
The only people who are not interested in being the V P  pick are the people who have not been asked 
I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey  She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa 
Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday  Very impressed  great people 
Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday  Despite a totally one sided interview by Chuck Todd  the end result was solid 
Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star  or plain star 

Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS it will just go on forever  We need change 
The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS  200 dead in Baghdad  worst in many years  We do not have leadership that can stop this 
In Bangladesh  hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran  20 were killed 
I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U S A G  So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught 
The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U S A G  in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting go away  no pictures  
Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U S A G  talked only about grandkids and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac  
THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED 
On Saturday a great man  Elie Wiesel  passed away The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil 
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U S A G  to work out a deal  The system is totally rigged & corrupt 
Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U S A G  was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know  
Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd  and the entire show  is against me The good news the people get it 
It was just announced by sources that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton  Like I said  the system is totally rigged 
It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton  What she did was wrong What Bill did was stupid 







The speakers slots at the Republican Convention are totally filled  with a long waiting list of those that want to speak Wednesday release 
Just read in the failing @nytimes that I was not aware the event had to be held in Cleveland a total lie  These people are sick 

Just returned from Colorado  Amazing crowd 





 @TraceAdkins great job on FOX this morning  Keep up the good work 
Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton  The system is totally rigged  Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence  
Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret  Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter  
As Bernie Sanders said  Hillary Clinton has bad judgement  Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary 

I will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on FOX Enjoy 
The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple  I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx  $50 million loan  I have totally terminated the loan 
The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign  Done deal 



The story with Hillary will never change https://www washingtonpost com/news/the fix/wp/2016/06/28/hillary clintons email story continues to get harder and harder to believe/ … 
For reasons only they can explain  the @USChamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better  
Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine  Thank you to everyone for making it so special 
@Gengm7: @jakeda @realDonaldTrump As of April this year  Hillary had spent $264 000 000 on her campaign Mr Trump $55 000 000  self funding 
I will be on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 P M  Enjoy 
ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch she's done nothing about it and never will  Not capable 


Just watched Senator John Barrasso on @FoxNews He was great Thank you John  
Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters  
The @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker  China  and many others  are taking advantage of U S  with our terrible trade pacts 
Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was  The media makes everything up 
@jtsbk: @AllenWest thanks for sharing Eric we need @realDonaldTrump now as this administration is incapable of keeping our country safe 
We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States  
Yet another terrorist attack  this time in Turkey  Will the world ever realize what is going on  So sad  
Hillary Clinton’s Presidency would be catastrophic for the future of our country  She is ill fit with bad judgment  
Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure  It just never seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton  

@kridan1: Canceled cable sick of their bad coverage of you and the fawning over Clinton     Listened to your great speech on YouTube 


@Patricia_Graf: @GovBrewer @cvpayne let's get Trump supporters out in massive numbers and make America Great Again create jobs 

@GovBrewer: I'll be a guest today on Making Money with @cvpayne on @ Fox Business 6 PM ET / 3 PM PT Discussing @realDonaldTrump  Tune in 
 @CNN is all negative when it comes to me  I don't watch it anymore  
The media is unrelenting  They will only go with and report a story in a negative light  I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong)  watch November 
Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U S  Senate  goofy Elizabeth Warren  who lied on heritage  




The dirty poll done by @ABC @washingtonpost is a disgrace  Even they admit that many more Democrats were polled  Other polls were good  

Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong  I said LEAVE will win  She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement  Only a question of time 
Hillary Clinton is not a change agent  just the same old status quo She is spending a fortune  I am spending very little  Close in polls 
People in our country want borders  and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win  It is time for CHANGE and JOBS 

The @ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats  Very dishonest why would they do that  Other polls good 
Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry  Shows me hitting shot  but I never did = lie Was there to support son 
Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads  Disgraceful 
Crooked Hillary Clinton  who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama)  is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call  
George Will  one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago)  has left the Republican Party He's made many bad calls 
Just landed in New York a one night stay in Scotland  Turnberry came out magnificently  My son  Eric  did a great job under budget 
Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs  That ends when I am President 
I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' but we must enforce the laws of the land 

We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place  
Thank you to everyone who came out & joined us @TrumpTurnberry yesterday @EricTrump @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJrpic twitter com/hQ1JTMrUtG 


So funny  Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly  and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U K  All talk  no action 

@Jolena3: @realDonaldTrump And we will get it back once we have President Trump Can't wait 
@DarrenWaggener: @realDonaldTrump What has happened in the UK in the last 12 hours is exactly what will happen in November  vote TRUMP 2016 
Many people are equating BREXIT  and what is going on in Great Britain  with what is happening in the U S  People want their country back 
The opening of Trump Turnberry in Scotland was a big success  Good timing  I was here for BREXIT  Very exciting news conference today 
Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT she went with Obama and now she is saying we need her to lead  She would be a disaster 
I want all Americans to succeed together  President Obama's illegal executive amnesty undermines job prospects for   https://www facebook com/DonaldTrump/posts/10157210293405725 … 
New Government data by the Center for Immigration Studies shows more than 3M new legal & illegal immigrants settled  https://www facebook com/DonaldTrump/posts/10157214830260725 … 
America is proud to stand shoulder to shoulder w/a free & ind UK  We stand together as friends  as allies  & as a people w/a shared history  
Self determination is the sacred right of all free people's  and the people of the UK have exercised that right for all the world to see  
Getting ready to open the magnificent Turnberry in Scotland  What a great day  especially when added to the brave & brilliant vote  

Just arrived in Scotland  Place is going wild over the vote  They took their country back  just like we will take America back  No games 
Congratulations to my son  Eric  on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding Turnberry  and its great Ailsa Course  Always support kids 
Leaving now for a one night trip to Scotland in order to be at the Grand Opening of my great Turnberry Resort  Will be back on Sat  night 
Meet the amazing mother whose letter I read during my speech  She lost her son to policies supported by Clinton http://www breitbart com/2016 presidential race/2016/06/22/momsaysclintonscampaignspewshate/ … 

Here is another CNN lie  The Clinton News Network is losing all credibility  I’m not watching it much anymore http://www breitbart com/big journalism/2016/06/23/cnns clinton cash fact check ends embarrassment cristina alesci laurie frankel/ … 
CNN  which is totally biased in favor of Clinton  should apologize  They knew they were wrong http://www breitbart com/2016 presidential race/2016/06/23/cnns tom foreman caught lying in trump refugees fact check/ … 
Our inner cities have been left behind  We will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border  
On immigration  I’m consulting with our immigration officers & our wage earners  Hillary Clinton is consulting with Wall Street  
Obama & Clinton should stop meeting with special interests  & start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration  

SC has kept us safe from exec amnesty for now  But Hillary has pledged to expand it  taking jobs from Hispanic & African American workers  

ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama  Donald J  Trump 
Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency  Donald J  Trump 
Thank you to Donald Rumsfeld for the endorsement  Very much appreciated  Clinton's conduct has been disqualifying  
@AllegrettiVicki: You have great children  future presidents   and we all see were raised right and out there for their father  Thank you  

@justininglv: @realDonaldTrump great speech today It's all about America and that's why you will become president Thank you  



@chrisboydbrew: @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness   Saw your interview You are the best Great questions  great answers Lou is great 
Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy 
I will be interviewed by @LouDobbs tonight on @FoxBusiness 7pm ET 
Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State  She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich Corrupt  dangerous  dishonest  
If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty & judgment  ask the family of Ambassador Stevens  
Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays  
I am the king of debt  That has been great for me as a businessman  but is bad for the country  I made a fortune off of debt  will fix U S  

Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans and make everyone less safe  
How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk  
Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State  costing Americans millions of jobs  
Hillary says this election is about judgment  She's right  Her judgement has killed thousands  unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy  
I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton  
Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president really bad judgement and a temperament  according to new book  which is a mess 
When I said that if  within the Orlando club  you had some people with guns  I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees 
 @DJohnsonPGA We are so proud of you Dustin  Your reaction under pressure was amazing  First of many Majors  You are a true CHAMPION 


How can the NY Times show an empty room hours before my speech even started when they knew it was going to be packed  So totally dishonest 





In Las Vegas  getting ready to speak 








MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN 
People very unhappy with Crooked Hillary and Obama on JOBS and SAFETY Biggest trade deficit in many years More attacks will follow Orlando 
Amazing crowd last night in Dallas more spirit and passion than ever before  Today  all over the great State of Texas 







@realericjallen: @realDonaldTrump is a Common Sense Conservative President Trump=Competence  Safety  Unity  & US JOBS  JOBS  JOB  
I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P M  @FoxNews 



I will be meeting with the NRA  who has endorsed me  about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list  or the no fly list  to buy guns  
The press is so totally biased that we have no choice but to take our tough but fair and smart message directly to the people 
An: Media fell all over themselves criticizing what DonaldTrump may have insinuated about @POTUS  But he's right:http://bit ly/1tpAFlM  



Thank you to the LGBT community I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs  
AMERICA FIRST 
American must now get very tough  very smart and very vigilant  We cannot admit people into our country without extraordinary screening  



I thought people weren’t celebrating  They were cheering all over  even this savage from Orlando  I was right http://nypost com/2016/06/13/orlando killer cheered 911 attacks former classmates say/ … 
In my speech on protecting America I spoke about a temporary ban  which includes suspending immigration from nations tied to Islamic terror  




I am watching @FoxNews and how fairly they are treating me and my words  and @CNN  and the total distortion of my words and what I am saying 
I will be going to New Hampshire today  home of my first primary victory  to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday  2:30 P M  
I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror  Hillary just broke said she would now use 
What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning  Our leadership is weak and ineffective  I called it and asked for the ban  Must be tough 
@WandaWalls20: @realDonaldTrump Please make us safe  We cannot have Hillary as president  We will be in so much trouble  
Reporting that Orlando killer shouted Allah hu Akbar as he slaughtered clubgoers  2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade  
Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism  If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace 
Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism  I don't want congrats  I want toughness & vigilance  We must be smart 
Horrific incident in FL  Praying for all the victims & their families  When will this stop  When will we get tough  smart & vigilant  
Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story  I would NEVER mock disabled  Shame 
Really bad shooting in Orlando  Police investigating possible terrorism  Many people dead and wounded  
Goofy Elizabeth Warren  sometimes referred to as Pocahontas  pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career  Very racist 
Riley Rone was a great young man  We will miss him dearly pic twitter com/R0tm44nMao 




Sad case @USATODAY did article saying I don't pay bills false  only don't pay when work is shoddy  bad  or not done They should do same 

Don King  and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me  would not have done so if they thought I was a racist 
Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog  Now he calls me racist but I am least racist person there is 






Heading to D C  to speak at Faith and Freedom Coalition and visit OPO  

The great boxing promoter  Don King  just endorsed me  Nice 



Pocahontas is at it again Goofy Elizabeth Warren  one of the least productive U S  Senators  has a nasty mouth  Hope she is V P  choice  


Thank you Roseanne  very much appreciated http://thehill com/blogs/blog briefing room/news/282864 roseanne barr we would be so lucky if trump won … 
How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up and where are your 33 000 emails that you deleted https://twitter com/hillaryclinton/status/740973710593654784 … 

Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary  He wants four more years of Obama—but nobody else does 
Crooked Hillary Clinton will be a disaster on jobs  the economy  trade  healthcare  the military  guns and just about all else  Obama plus 
As expected  the media is very much against me  Their dishonesty is amazing but  just like our big wins in the primaries  we will win 
@KathyCeurter: @realDonaldTrump please Mr Trump make @SenatorJeffSessions your VP  He is a perfect running mate  He is a great guy 
Bernie Sanders must really dislike Crooked Hillary after the way she played him  Many of his supporters  because of trade  will come to me  
@mabynshingleton: JohnKasich  the VOTERS have spoken We want @realDonaldTrump  You AGREED to support NOMINEE  Get on board or leave @GOP 
@Dale_Dangler: @realDonaldTrump You will be the greatest president the world has ever seen Thanks  
I would have had many millions of votes more than Crooked Hillary Clinton except for the fact that I had 16 opponents  she had one 
@nauthizjane: @realDonaldTrump Congratulations Mr  Trump  Thank you 
@setfire2flames: Senator Sanders spent more than @realDonaldTrump yet lost  

@lovusa4: @RichardWeaving Why @foxandfriends @NewDay WHERE IS THE REPORTING @realDonaldTrump <MOST VOTES FOR PRESIDENT IN HISTORY OF USA 
@mariadaq: HISTORIC what's historic is OUR national debt  record unemployment  &pocketbook crisis THE PEOPLE NEED TRUMP2 make USA RICH 
@sara_wejesa: @realDonaldTrump Great speach Thanks 
@jimhewitt:   @FrankCaliendo doing @realDonaldTrump on @MikeAndMike is awesome  Number one presidency of all time 
@JoeDeFranco: Top RINO hack for MSNBC Joey Scarborough on the air and calling the next President Trump a racist and bigot  Shame on you 
Nobody is watching @Morning_Joe anymore  Gone off the deep end bad ratings  You won't believe what I am watching now 
@southpaw816: @SenSanders fans  greatest way to get even with her Highness vote for @realDonaldTrump  at least you'll have a job  
Thank you to all for your wonderful comments on my speech  I could feel the electricity in thr air  Great reviews most votes ever recieved 







I will be speaking about our great journey to the Republican nomination at 9:00 P M  The movement toward a country that WINS again continues 
I will be interviewed tonight on @seanhannity Enjoy 10:00 P M  

In just out book  Secret Service Agent Gary Byrne doesn't believe that Crooked Hillary has the temperament or integrity to be the president 
A former Secret Service Agent for President Clinton excoriates Crooked Hillary describing her as ERRATIC & VIOLENT  Bad temperament for pres 
See  when I said NATO was obsolete because of no terrorism protection  they made the change without giving me credit http://www wsj com/articles/nato considers new intelligence chief post 1464968453 … 


I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff  But small is good  flexible  save money and number one 
A massive blow to Obama's message only 38 000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report  That's REALLY bad 
Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women  She is a total fraud 
Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months  Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions 

People like @KatyTurNBC report on my campaign  but have zero access  They say what they want without any knowledge True of so much of media 
Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president  She has bad judgement  poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record  Change 
I am watching @CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me  Shows are predictable garbage CNN and MSM is one big lie 
The Clinton News Network  sometimes referred to as @CNN  is getting more and more biased They act so indignant hear them behind closed doors 

Thank you Attorney General Gonzales  so many people feel this way http://thehill com/blogs/ballot box/presidential races/282222 former bush ag trump right to challenge judges fairness … 
We just had the worst jobs report since 2010  
The Mayor of San Jose did a terrible job of ordering the protection of innocent people  The thugs were lucky supporters remained peaceful 
Many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were illegals  They burned the American flag and laughed at police 


Muhammad Ali is dead at 74 A truly great champion and a wonderful guy  He will be missed by all 

Great evening in San Jose other than the thugs  My supporters are far tougher if they want to be  but fortunately they are not hostile  
So much interest in my visit to Scotland I greatly look forward to attending the opening event @TrumpTurnberry taking place on June 24th  

In Crooked Hillary's telepromter speech yesterday  she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact  Not honest 
I don't watch or do @Morning_Joe anymore  Small audience  low ratings I hear Mika has gone wild with hate  Joe is Joe  They lost their way 
Rally last night in San Jose was great  Tremendous love and enthusiasm in the hall  Big crowd  Outside  small group of thugs burned Am flag 
Terrible jobs report just reported  Only 38 000 jobs added  Bombshell 

@LiliannyLeebou: I think the first female president of the USA will be @IvankaTrump a beautiful intelligent young genuine successful lady 


@Crz4basball: @JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump Looks like several legal Hispanics supporting Trump They know he will be good for them too  
Then  on June 25th back to the USA to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
After @TrumpScotland  I will visit @TrumpDoonbeg in Ireland  the magnificent resort fronting on the Atlantic Ocean  
After @TrumpTurnberry I will be visiting Aberdeen  the oil capital of Europe  to see my great club  @TrumpScotland  
On June 22 I will be going to Scotland to celebrate the opening of the newly renovated @TrumpTurnberry Resort  the worlds best  


@RobertMordica: @realDonaldTrump Only Trump can save America  Right leader at the right time  THANK YOU 
@Valenti317: @realDonaldTrump she's a criminal and you're the only person that can stop her  

@free_SA_BD: @realDonaldTrump A vote for Trump is a vote to restore our great country  
A 60% increase in Texas Blue Cross/Blue Shield through ObamaCare  I told you so  there is panic and anger as healthcare costs explode 
So great to have the endorsement and support of Paul Ryan  We will both be working very hard to Make America Great Again 
Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton Reading poorly from the telepromter She doesn't even look presidential 
Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility too much failure in office  People will not allow another four years of incompetence 
Crooked Hillary Clinton  who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary  is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions  
After the litigation is disposed of and the case won  I have instructed my execs to open Trump U( )  so much interest in it I will be pres  
Even though I have a very biased and unfair judge in the Trump U civil case in San Diego  I have thousands of great reviews & will win case 
With all of the Crooked Hillary Clinton's foreign policy experience  she has made so many mistakes and I mean real monsters No more HRC  

Wow  USA Today did todays cover story on my record in lawsuits  Verdict: 450 wins  38 losses  Isn't that what you want for your president  
Do you ever notice that @CNN gives me very little proper representation on my policies  Just watched nobody knew anything about my foreign P 
Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement 
Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero natural talent she should not be president  Her temperament is bad and her decision making ability zilch 

@SCPioneer: @stockdaleism @JamesRosenFNC @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Not for slackers Happy w/courses I took  Thanks  

Same failing @nytimes reporter who wrote discredited women's story last week wrote another terrible story on me today will never learn 
Crooked Hillary Clinton is a fraud who has put the public and country at risk by her illegal and very stupid use of e mails  Many missing 

So I raised/gave $5 600 000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad They do anything to belittle totally biased  
Congratulations to @seanhannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings  Speaking of ratings I will be on his show tonight @ 10pE  
I am getting great credit for my press conference today  Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days  
Katie Couric  the third rate reporter  who has been largely forgotten  should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc  
I will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10pmE on @FoxNews  Enjoy 

So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave It was my great honor they do an amazing job  
Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5 600 000 that I raised/gave 
I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS  and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so  Watch 
So many great things happening new poll numbers looking good News conference at 11:00 A M  today  Trump Tower 
I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge  Gonzalo Curiel  who is totally biased against me  
I have a judge in the Trump University civil case  Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego)  who is very unfair  An Obama pick  Totally biased hates Trump 
I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day 
I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent  instead of sixteen  Broke record 
Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 

@FrankyLamouche: how many of donald's rolling thunder brigade will sign up and go to war for him in the middle east  



The endorsement of me by the 16 500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate  Nice 
In getting the endorsement of the 16 500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you)  the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary 
Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W H  
If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent  say good bye to the Supreme Court 
The Republican Party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in November  Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate 
Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs an embarrassed loser  but if the GOP can't control their own  then they are not a party  Be tough  R's 
Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do  
Heading to D C  to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER  Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY  Great spirit 
Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country We love them  

Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign  The only quote that matters is a quote from me 
I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes  but when I won the GOP nomination  I'm in the back of the paper  Very dishonest 
The media is on a new phony kick about my management style  I spend much less money & get much better results What we need as Prez 
The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style & that I don't have many people  I have 73  Hillary has 800 & I'm beating her  
I (we) broke the all time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary by a lot and with many states left to go Thank you  
The U S  has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders  How nice  but what do we get  NOT ENOUGH 

Obama administration fails to screen Syrian refugees' social media accounts:http://m washingtontimes com/news/2016/apr/26/obama administration fails to screen syrian refuge/ … 
 @SanDiegoPD Fantastic job on handling the thugs who tried to disrupt our very peaceful and well attended rally  Greatly appreciated 
Thank you @BillyJoel many friends just told me you gave a very kind shoutout at MSG  Appreciate it love your music 

I am on @oreillyfactor tonight  a big special  @FoxNews at 8:00 P M  ENJOY 


Poll data shows that @marcorubio does by far the best in holding onto his Senate seat in Florida  Important to keep the MAJORITY  Run Marco 




I find it offensive that Goofy Elizabeth Warren  sometimes referred to as Pocahontas  pretended to be Native American to get in Harvard  

 @kimguilfoyle just watched you on @OutnumberedFNC thank you 
The Inspector General's report on Crooked Hillary Clinton is a disaster  Such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the W H  

Thank you Washington Honored to say  on behalf of our great movement  we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history  
The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag  The rally inside was big and beautiful  but outside  criminals 
Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie  I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates  Hillary doesn't have it 
Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma has done less in the U S  Senate than practically any other senator  All talk  no action 
@elizabethforma Goofy Elizabeth Warren  sometimes known as Pocahontas  bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing  Total hypocrite 
@gordonsr1052: Washington  BIG Thank You for supporting Trump We are all going to help Trump Make America Great Again Trump2016 
@buiIdthewall: @realDonaldTrump high energy 
@PiperSul: Great speech tonight Mr Trump Good Luck in California Thank you  
@DeepakS76435750: @realDonaldTrump congratulations from India 


@tcloer11: @realDonaldTrump Great job Make America Great Again 
@elizabethforma Goofy Elizabeth Warren  sometimes referred to as Pocahontas because she faked the fact she is native American  is a lowlife 
Great rally in New Mexico  amazing crowd Now in L A  Big rally in Anaheim  


After raising  w/ no obligation  almost $6M for Vets  I couldn't believe protesters formed @ Trump Tower  JUST OUT SENT BY CROOKED HILLARY 


A wonderfully written article concerning Israel by @JasonDovEsqhttp://blogs timesofisrael com/a trump presidency means a safer israel/ … 
A great new book has been written about Crooked Hillary  Read it & you will never be able to vote for her  @Ed_Kleinhttp://www amazon com/Unlikeable Problem Hillary Edward Klein/dp/1621573788 … 
Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates  overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs  Most importantly  she suffers from plain old bad judgement 
I just released my financial disclosure forms  the largest numbers in the history of the F E C  Even the dishonest media thinks great 
Amazingly  with all of the money I have raised for the vets  I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media  
Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed  with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups  
While under no obligation to do so  I have raised between 5 & 6 million dollars  including 1million dollars from me  for our VETERANS  Nice 

I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 P M  Enjoy 
Obama’s VA Secretary just said we shouldn't measure wait times  Hillary says VA problems are not ‘widespread ’ I will take care of our vets 

In trade  military and EVERYTHING else  it will be AMERICA FIRST This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 

The American people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists 
Bernie Sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that Crooked Hillary Clinton will be forced out of the race e mail scandal 

Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees  We can’t allow this  Time to get smart and protect America 
How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam  which horribly oppresses women  
Why do the networks continue to put dopey @BillKristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs  
Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad Would be four more years of stupidity 
Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom  Wrong 
@dubilujane: I trust @realDonaldTrump more anyone ever to protect America He WILL do the right thing for the U S A  without a doubt  

Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria  Iraq and Libya  She is reckless and dangerous 

 @CNN is so negative  getting even worse as I get closer  Just had two anti Trump losers with zero rebuttal from my team  Turning off 

Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed  No more guns to protect Hillary 
While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day  the TSA is falling apart  just like our government Airports a total disaster 
Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me  She is a very dishonest person 
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment  No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton 
Thank you @TheTodaysGolfer for the wonderful statement that the new par 3 9th hole @Trump Turnberry could be the most dramatic in Britain  
@montgomeriefdn Colin  great to have you at Trump Turnberry  So proud of you and your GREAT playing You made winning MAJORS look easy 




Failing @NYTimes will always take a good story about me and make it bad  Every article is unfair and biased  Very sad 
Thanks @piersmorgan Trump is the most unpredictable  extraordinary  entertaining&massively popular candidate this country has ever seen  


A Call for Unity by Jason Greenblatt @JasonDovEsqhttps://medium com/@jgreenblatt/a call for unity 2e7a33eceef3# k45jbtw9t … 
Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary  Four more years of this  No way 
Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential  I don't think so Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back  ISIS LAUGHS 
Look where the world is today  a total mess  and ISIS is still running around wild  I can fix it fast  Hillary has no chance 
Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina  ISIS  China  Russia and all would love for her to be president  4 more years 
I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because she has very bad judgement Bernie said the same thing 

How quality a woman is Rowanne Brewer Lane to have exposed the @nytimes as a disgusting fraud  Thank you Rowanne  
Looks like yet another terrorist attack  Airplane departed from Paris  When will we get tough  smart and vigilant  Great hate and sickness 
My list of potential U S  Supreme Court Justices was very well recieved  During the next number of weeks I may be adding to the list 
Some low life journalist claims that I made a pass at her 29 years ago  Never happened Like the @nytimes story which has become a joke 



Why did Clinton supporter @AlisonForKY declare Crooked Hillary winner in KY when AP hasn't even called the race  
Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats the system is rigged against him  Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me 
Paul Begala  the dopey @CNN flunky and head of the Pro Hillary Clinton Super PAC  has knowingly committed fraud in his first ad against me  
@ShoneeP: @realDonaldTrump Trump for President Bernie is a joke  knows nothing and Hillary is yesterday's and today's nightmare 

Congratulations to THE MOVEMENT  we have just won THE GREAT STATE OF OREGON  The vote percentage is even higher than anticipated Thank you  


@sandrajeanne48: No way I believe Trump at 70% disapproval with women  Went to 3 rallies  At least 1/2 women  MSM LIES @TheFive 
Michael Barbaro  the author of the now discredited @nytimes hit piece on me with women  has in past tweeted badly about me  He should resign 
@michael_favreau: @JIS3 @realDonaldTrump He will destroy Hillary but why give CNN record breaking ratings CNN can go to hell  Trump 2016 
I look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton Democrat Primaries are rigged  e mail investigation is rigged so time to get it on 
I can't believe that @CNN would allow the very nice Jeffrey Lord to be savaged by a panel of seven Trump haters  7 to 1 Don't watch CNN 
@COWBOYSFORTRUMP: @ChristiChat @Rockprincess818 @realDonaldTrump That man is a pillar of strength and will be perfect as our next president 
Well  that is it  Well done Megyn and they all lived happily ever after Now let us all see how THE MOVEMENT does in Oregon tonight 
Will go back on for a final question now

@longbyfive: @realDonaldTrump great interview with @megynkelly Thanks  

@wesleyfelixpsi: @realDonaldTrump speaks from the heart 4 all of America His intention is for a positive future 4 all  @FoxNews @megynkelly 
@manakoa:DonaldTrump  you are fearless This interview shows you are the Leader we need  @megynkelly is a tough interview Respect to both 
@ragdollive: @megynkelly @realDonaldTrump what's with the soft wimpy questions    It's not a therapy session    Not really soft at all 
@xGodfatherxzx: @realDonaldTrump amazing on Megan Kelly Thanks  
@TrumpTrainRider:  @realDonaldTrump Watching you on Fox with @megynkelly now  Can't wait to hear what you two talked about  
I will be live tweeting @megynkelly Show in 10 minutes  Should be interesting  Will be on Fox Network ENJOY 
Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud  just like Crooked Hillary Their main line had nothing to do with women  and they knew it  Apologize  
Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal  If she can't win Kentucky  she should drop out of race  System rigged 

I look forward to watching @megynkelly tonight  8 PM ET  It will be interesting to see how she treats me—I think she will be very fair  
How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA  the worst economic deal in U S  history  
Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy If so  he should run not her Will he bring the energizer to D C   

Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders  Will be another bad day for her 
Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U S  political history 
Oregon is voting today  Keep the big numbers going VOTE TRUMP MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women  Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts My hit was on China 
The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line  You can tell them to go BLANK themselves was about China  NOT WOMEN 
Wow  30 000 e mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton  She said they had to do with a wedding reception  Liar How can she run  

What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly  and for years  trying to come back  I said no  
I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N Y  construction job  when that was unheard of  and now she is nasty  So much for a nice thank you 
In politics  and in life  ignorance is not a virtue  This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U S  history 
The writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes  Michael Barbaro  who was interviewed on CBS this morning  was unable to respond  
Over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6  That’s because there were so many positive statements  
No wonder the @nytimes is failing—who can believe what they write after the false  malicious & libelous story they did on me  
The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women  
Rowanne Brewer  the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday joined @foxandfriends https://amp twimg com/v/ebf3185d 9258 407b a53a a92289f9e7fb … 

With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me  we have exposed the article as a fraud 
A political commentator for @cnn  which I no longer watch  said Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries  I set all time record 
Wow  Rowanne Brewer  the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday  was on @foxandfriends saying Times lied 
The @nytimes is so dishonest  Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer  who said it was a lie 
That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is 
Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems  The system is rigged against him  He should run as an independent Run Bernie  run  

The @washingtonpost report on potential VP candidates is wrong  Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration  

The media is really on a witch hunt against me  False reporting  and plenty of it but we will prevail 
Why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers  DISHONEST 
Wow  I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece  Massive front page for that 
Why doesn't the failing @nytimes write the real story on the Clintons and women  The media is TOTALLY dishonest 

@tzard000: @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Everyone continues to pile onto Donald  but they can NEVER take away our votes Thank you 
Everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women I gave them many names of women I helped refused to use 

@MrTohNey: Leicester & DonaldTrump seem to have the same trajectory  both were written off  but they keep scaling the heights  History  
@QueenCharlotteO: @realDonaldTrump @nytimes I'm a women & I 100% support @realDonaldTrump & I have since the beginning  Thank you 
The failing @nytimes wrote yet another hit piece on me  All are impressed with how nicely I have treated women  they found nothing  A joke 
Thank you for the nice words this morning @KellyRiddell  Well delivered and totally logical @CNN @FoxNews 

Wow  @CNN is really working hard to make me look as bad as possible  Very unprofessional  Hurting in ratings bad television 

If Crooked Hillary Clinton can't close the deal on Crazy Bernie  how is she going to take on China  Russia  ISIS and all of the others  

 @thehill Your story about me & the carbon tax is absolutely incorrect—it is just the opposite  I will not support or endorse a carbon tax 
Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday  very much to my surprise  and we had a very interesting talk about national security  and more 


If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren  we’d have no jobs in America—she doesn’t have a clue  
In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete  not after election 
Isn’t it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump & gets nothing done in Senate  
Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage  See media—asking for increase 
Our Native American Senator  goofy Elizabeth Warren  couldn’t care less about the American worker…does nothing to help 
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman’s card like her friend crooked Hillary  See her dumb tweet “when a woman stands up to you…” 
If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been  she would lose 
Thanks Piers https://twitter com/piersmorgan/status/730465526993039360 … 

Goofy Elizabeth Warren didn’t have the guts to run for POTUS  Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold  
Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U S  Senate  She has done nothing 
I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary  His time will come 
Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska  Get ready for November Crooked Hillary  who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie  will lose 


The Clintons spend millions on negative ads on me & I can’t tell the truth about her husband  Don’t feel sorry for crooked Hillary 

It was so great being in Nebraska last week  Today is the big day get out and vote 
I look very much forward to meeting w/Paul Ryan & the GOP Party Leadership on Thurs in DC  Together  we will beat the Dems at all levels 
Via @JTAnews and Jason Greenblatt Donald Trump is a Visionary With Talents Our Country Needs @JasonDovEsqhttp://www jta org/2016/04/18/news opinion/politics/donald trump is a visionary with talents our country needs … 


It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position  
It was Rosie O'Donnell who ate the cake in the vicious Hillary commercial about me  not Crooked Hillary @marthamaccallum 
Why does the media  with a strong push from Crooked Hillary  keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes  Exactly opposite 

Get out and vote Nebraska  we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Get out and vote West Virginia  we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 


I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate  Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current 
I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party despite having to compete against 17 other people 
If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton  I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did 
Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump  But I had 17 people to beat—she had one 



@daybastrop @foxandfriends @BretBaier The liars that signed the pledge and now won't support @realDonaldTrump IS the reason they are losers 
@NathanDWilsonFL: @MariaBartiromo you had a great interview with Donald today I started watching your show due to Donald Trump  
Will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo on @FoxBizAlert at 7:30 A M  Enjoy 
@RichBooth6: @realDonaldTrump @CNN good interview Mr  Trump  You set the facts straight  Thank you  
Wow  I hear @Morning_Joe has gone really hostile ever since I said I won't do or watch the show anymore They misrepresent my positions 
I will be interviewed on @CNN at 7:00 A M  
 @drmoore Russell Moore is truly a terrible representative of Evangelicals and all of the good they stand for  A nasty guy with no heart 

I will be interviewed on @NewDay @CNN at 7:00 A M  
I will win the election against Crooked Hillary despite the people in the Republican Party that are currently and selfishly opposed to me 
On @seanhannity show @FoxNews now  ENJOY 
Crooked Hillary just can't close the deal with Bernie  It will be the same way with ISIS  and China on trade  and Mexico at the border  Bad 
 @KellyannePolls Kellyanne  you were fantastic on @meetthepress today  Keep going I will win for the people  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
I will be interviewed on @meetthepress this morning  Enjoy 
I will be interviewed on This Week with George S this morning  Enjoy 

@matandsher: I want a leader that will shoot straight with us  The politicians can't  @realDonaldTrump will give his all for us 
 @EdGoeas thank you for your support tonight on @JudgeJeanine  
Remember when the two failed presidential candidates  Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush  signed a binding PLEDGE  They broke the deal  no honor 
I am honored that the great men and women of the @Teamsters have created a movement from within called Teamsters for Trump Thank you  
I am going to keep our jobs in the U S   and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure  Crooked Hillary has no clue @Teamsters 

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective  Does nothing  All talk  no action maybe her Native American name  
Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant  She is too easy I'm driving her nuts  
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders  Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me  
Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska  Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant  but leaves behind amazing legacy  
Goofy Elizabeth Warren  Hillary Clinton’s flunky  has a career that is totally based on a lie  She is not Native American  
Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American  I say she’s a fraud 
I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate  I will defeat them both  

I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run  This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win  
Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed  then John Kasich and that didn't work  Not much power or insight 
Thank you to teachers across America When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now  
Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability  As Bernie Sanders says  she has bad judgement  Constantly playing the women's card it is sad 
Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special  the Republican Party  Wrong  I didn't inherit it  I won it with millions of voters 

So many great endorsements yesterday  except for Paul Ryan We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Governor Rick Perry said Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen  Thank you Rick 
Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton  who wants to destroy all miners  I want wages to go up in America  We will do so by bringing back jobs 

Can you believe Crooked Hillary said  We are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&coal companies out of business  She then apologized  

Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates & otherwise  He should show them  & run as an Independent  

I will be interviewed by @BretBaier @SpecialReport at 6pm ET tonight @FoxNews 
Many reports that I will be attending the Alvarez/Khan fight this weekend in Vegas  Totally untrue Unfortunately I have other plans  

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30 A M  Enjoy 
I will be interviewed on @TODAYshow and Good Morning America at 7:00 A M  
I will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 6:15 A M  Enjoy 
I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie 
What a great evening we had  So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary  The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him 
 @oreillyfactor Please correct  I WON Virginia 
Thank you Indiana  we were just projected to be the winner  We have won in every category  You are very special people I will never forget 

Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will  and must  win Indiana  If he doesn't he should drop out of the race stop wasting time & money 
Wow  Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today  Made all sorts of crazy charges  Can't function under pressure not very presidential  Sad 







Will be in South Bend  Indiana in a short while big rally See you soon 





I will be campaigning in Indiana all day  Things are looking great  and the support of Bobby Knight has been so amazing  Today will be fun 
Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags  I want America First so do voters 
Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs  and he thanks me I will bring back jobs to USA  
Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to dealing with men who get off the reservation  Actually  she has done poorly with such men 
I will be interviewed on @CNN @NewDay at 7:30 A M  Enjoy 



 @KarlRove is a failed Jeb Bushy  Never says anything good & never will  even after I beat Hillary  Shouldn't be on the air 

Will be in Terre Haute  Indiana in a short while big rally See you soon 
I watched Sen  Graham @FaceTheNation  Why don't they say that I ran him out of the race like a little boy  and in the end he had no support  

I will be in Indiana on Sunday and Monday at four MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN rallies  See you there 
Thank you @MikeOzanian for the nice comments on @FoxNews today  Great job 

The economy is bad and getting worse almost ZERO growth this quarter  Nobody can beat me on the economy (and jobs)  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 

The protesters in California were thugs and criminals  Many are professionals  They should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement 
 @AC360 Anderson  so amazing  Your mother is  and always has been  an incredible woman 
We are now at 1001 delegates  We will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged 

Crooked Hillary Clinton  perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency  is also one of the all time great enablers 
Wow  the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up  What a dumb deal dead on arrival 







So many false and phony T V  commercials being broadcast in Indiana  Reminds me of Florida where thousands were put up I won in a landslide 
I will be in Evansville  Indiana  with the great Bobby Knight (who last night endorsed me) at 12:00 this afternoon  See you there 
Lyin' Ted Cruz  who can never beat Hillary Clinton and has NO path to victory  has chosen a V P candidate who failed badly in her own effort 
I will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow at 7:00 A M  this morning  Enjoy 
Thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech  I will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics 
@AnnetteJeanne: I cried when they said you made a clean sweep of all 5 states  I was SO HAPPY I really adore you Mr  Trump  so much  
Getting the strong endorsement of the great coach  Bobby Knight  has been a highlight of my stay in Indiana  Big speech tomorrow with Bobby 
I am in Indiana where we just had a great rally  Fantastic people Staying at a Holiday Inn Express new and clean  not bad 





















How bad is the New York Times—the most inaccurate coverage constantly  Always trying to belittle  Paper has lost its way 

Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates & otherwise  He should show them  and run as an Independent 


The Cruz Kasich pact is under great strain  This joke of a deal is falling apart  not being honored and almost dead  Very dumb 





On the way to the great state of Rhode Island big rally  Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night 
Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him  Typical politician can't make a deal work  
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses  
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one  Shows weakness 
Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate  Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them  Sad 
Wow  just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination  DESPERATION 
I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing  It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down  Becoming irrelevant 
@DiamondandSilk:  @DonaldJTrumpJr awesome job on @CNNSotu  DonaldTrump has integrity & he refuses 2 play the game call Delegate Bribery 

I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally  Things are looking good for Tuesday 
 @AndreBauer Great job and advice on @CNN @jaketapper Thank you 
 @Borisep was great on @JudgeJeanine tonight  Very smart commentary that will prove to be correct 
As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads  he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton  I will win 
I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut  Looking for a big vote on Tuesday 
Congratulations to @seanhannity on his great ratings and ratings increase as reported by the @AP today  Amazing job 






Will be spending the day campaigning in Connecticut  another state where jobs are being stolen by other countries  I will stop this fast 





I met Prince on numerous occasions  He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy  He will be greatly missed 
Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237  Now he can't get to 1237  Drop out LYIN' Ted  
Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory  They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify 
Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race  He said Kasich should get out for same reason  I think both should get out 
I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife  Melania  and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall  Hopefully  it will be fun Enjoy 7A M  

We are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to Indiana 




Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race  Now all he can do is be a spoiler  never a nice thing to do  I will beat Hillary 


Thank you New York  I will never forget 

 @CNN is so negative it is impossible to watch  Terrible panel  angry haters  Bill O @oreillyfactor said such an amazing thing about me 


@kdk144: @realDonaldTrump Everybody is In A New York State of Mind now 



Who did the House Task Force on Urgent Fiscal Issues call when America needed HELP https://amp twimg com/v/6d5ebafa 67c0 48ea b4e6 82928b5c5851 … 





A big day for New York and for our COUNTRY MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
I am on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A M  ENJOY 


Lyin’ Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help  So many New Yorkers devastated  Cruz hates New York 

Kasich only looks O K  in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him 
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses I am millions of VOTES ahead Hillary would destroy him & K 
@DiamondandSilk:  @realDonaldTrump is who we need 2 fix this corrupted  rigged system  4 no Profit  Under budget & ahead of schedule  


I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie 
Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me  I am the one person she doesn't want to run against  Will be such fun 
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses  It won't work 
Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary  Despite a rigged delegate system  I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him  
I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning  Staten Island  Big crowd  will be fun 





@AshleyEdam: New CBS Poll shows defections from Cruz's core supporters & increased support for @realDonaldTrump    Not surprising  

@Trump_Supporter: Trump Holds 66% Favorable Rating in New York – Leads Hillary Clinton by 19pts in Empire   http://ln is/thegatewaypundit com/67sZu … 



I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 9:00 A M  I will be talking about the rigged and boss controlled Republican primaries 
@dmharvey89: @realDonaldTrump @wdct8110 I just voted for @realDonaldTrump in Indiana  Everyone I talk to was following suit Fantastic 
@herb_stamper: @JackoffJosh711 @SenFrankNiceley @FoxNews @WSJ we are becoming a third world country because of jerks like him Great 

@Bubble709_: @realDonaldTrump Praying for your family and your win in New York  Thank you 






Big protest march in Colorado on Friday afternoon Don't let the bosses take your vote 
The rules DID CHANGE in Colorado shortly after I entered the race in June because the pols and their bosses knew I would win with the voters 
Biggest story in politics is now happening in the great State of Colorado where over one million people have been precluded from voting 




Great to be on @andersoncooper tonight with my wonderful family  Will be rebroadcast at 12:00 A M  (EASTERN)  







A very interesting piece  by a very good writer  @KirstenPowers of @USATODAY and @FoxNews http://www usatoday com/story/opinion/2016/04/11/donald trump interview elections 2016 ayn rand vp pick politics column/82899566/ …

Colorado Trump Delegates Scratched from Ballots at GOP Conventionhttp://www thegatewaypundit com/2016/04/disgusting colorado trump delegate scratched list gop convention cruzers take delegates/ … 

@AnnesLimo: @realDonaldTrump @WVTTS1017 Thanks for Rochester rally  Great people  thank you 
@WVTTS1017: @realDonaldTrump just listened to you on fox  I love you so much  Thank you 

@TimeHasCome1: @WayneDupreeShow @ThePatriot143 Trump needs to hold a massive protest rally in Colorado  He'd get 100k & own the news cycle 
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A M  Enjoy 
The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians  Biggest story in politics  This will not be allowed 
How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary  Great anger totally unfair 

I win a state in votes and then get non representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign  Bad system 
The @nytimes purposely covers me so inaccurately  I want other nations to pay the U S  for our defense of them  We are the suckers no more 

@getreal1234: @realDonaldTrump @Kids123Nicholas @gqforbes @RepTomMarino let's go Pa he has my vote Go Trump 

@becker_berta: @vivhall3 @Reince Millions more will burn their Republican registration if GOP continues to subvert the will of the people  
@metalmom888: @Theresa_Cali If the GOP screws Trump  his millions will walk from the GOP never to return They better think long and hard 
@AnnCoulter: GOP is trying to steal nomination from the winner (Trump) not block an insurgent catching up 2 frontrunner (Sanders)  

@Mutual408Grace: @realDonaldTrump @gene70 California women love Mr Trump too  Will make it happen in New York on April 19  Go out & vote  
@Kids123Nicholas: @gqforbes @RepTomMarino @realDonaldTrump Lets get it done Philadelphia Pa Make Trump your pick for president now  






Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president  Based on her decision making ability  I can go along with that 
Isn't it a shame that the person who will have by far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else  me  still must fight 

@AlexNightrasor: @realDonaldTrump @lilrachiepoo Trump will be our best president since Reagan 

@RepaloneLori: @realDonaldTrump @kirstiealley we love you and know you will do an awesome job Saw you in bethpage Thank you

A great day in Wisconsin  many stops  many great people Melania is joining me on Monday  Big crowds  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 


Congratulations to @gohermie for winning the @ShellHouOpen  We are all proud of you @TNGCBedminster & all @TrumpGolf clubs Great going 







@Wheels155:@CNN is reviewing the week but majority of the show about @realDonaldTrump cuz there would be 0 0 ratings if not  Media's a JOKE 
I will be on @FoxNewsSunday with Chris Wallace this morning  Enjoy 




 @FoxNews should be ashamed for allowing experts to explain how to make a nuclear attack 
 @HeyTammyBruce Thank you for your nice words on Fox today  They never use my full statements on nuclear  which you would agree with 


Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade  but if I win  all of the bad things happening in the U S  will be rapidly reversed 
I will be in Wisconsin until the election  Jobs  trade and immigration will be big factors  I will bring jobs back home make great deals 
If @megynkelly stopped covering me on her show  her ratings would drop like a rock My h to h interview with @AC360 beat her by millions 
Is it possible for @megynkelly to cover anyone but Donald Trump on her terrible show  She totally misrepresents my words and positions BAD  

Can you believe that Ted Cruz  who has been killing our country on trade for so long  just put out a Wisconsin ad talking about trade  



For the 1st time in American history  America’s 16 500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsement—me Thank you  
The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) said that our open border is the biggest physical & economic threat facing the American people 
The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (Cruz) plus 143 delegates (Kasich) is more than my 739 delegates  Try again 
The Club For Growth which asked me for $1 000 000 in an extortion attempt  just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math What a dumb group 




Just had a very nice meeting with @Reince Priebus and the @GOP  Looking forward to bringing the Party together and it will happen 


@Gearssuxs: @loudobbsnews @realDonaldTrump I'm a democrat and switch over to republican just to vote for trump in the primary  Great 


Please keep your thoughts & prayers with Melissa Young Miss Wisconsin 2005 http://www cnn com/2016/03/30/politics/trump miss wisconsin emotional moment/index html sr=twCNN033016trump miss wisconsin emotional moment0214PMStoryLink&linkId=22869280 … 

 @DavidGregory got thrown off of TV by NBC  fired like a dog Now he is on @CNN being nasty to me  Not nice 


Trump defends campaign manager charged for bruising a reporter:http://dailym ai/1V15tU3  


Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference  What is in her hand  pic twitter com/HQB8dl0fhn 
This was the reporters statement when she found out there was tape from my facility  she changed her tune pic twitter com/N5815RS1At 
Victory press conference was over  Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions  Can I press charges pic twitter com/qbW2RjkINX 
Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened  that is before she found out the episode was on tape  
Wow  Corey Lewandowski  my campaign manager and a very decent man  was just charged with assaulting a reporter  Look at tapes nothing there 
How come the @TODAYshow & @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz  
I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich  and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC  
Wow  @CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows  Really one sided and unfair reporting  Maybe I shouldn't do their town hall tonight 
We need to secure our borders ASAP  No games  we must be smart  tough and vigilant  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN 
Lyin' Ted  I have already beaten you in all debates  and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates  You should focus on jobs & illegal imm 
Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak & losing big  so now he wants to debate again  But  according to Drudge Time and on line polls  I have won all debates 
After the way I beat Gov  Scott Walker (and Jeb  Rand  Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries  no way he would ever endorse me 
@PaulaDuvall2: Cruz will say anything that is contrary to what you have to say  If you're for Motherhood  he'll be against it 
Just released that international gangs are all over our cities  This will end when I am President 
@wolfblitzer: Campaign to date popular GOP totals: @realDonaldTrump 7 546 980; @tedcruz 5 481 737; @JohnKasich 2 724 749 A BIG DIFFERENCE 
Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism  as well as current mission  but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE  a must 
A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American  When will our so called leaders ever learn

@nellalda: @realDonaldTrump We stand by Trump 100% Thank you 
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30  Things are looking good  had a great Easter look forward to spending the week in Wisconsin 

The United States cannot continue to make such bad  one sided trade deals  There are only so many jobs we can give up  No more 

Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be  I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz Lawsuit coming 
Why can't the pundits be honest  Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again  I will make it strong and great JOBS 
Another radical Islamic attack  this time in Pakistan  targeting Christian women & children  At least 67 dead 400 injured  I alone can solve 
Happy Easter to all  have a great day 
My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U S  are now  finally  receiving plaudits 
Wow  sleepy eyes @chucktodd is at it again  He is do totally biased  The things I am saying are correct  far better vision than the others 
I am interviewed on This Week on @ABC this morning  Enjoy 
Remember  I am the only candidate who is self funding  While I am given little credit for this by the voters  I am not bought like others 
Don't believe the @FoxNews Polls  they are just another phony hit job on me  I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election  
Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U S   jobs are leaving  I will make our economy strong again bring in jobs 
Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J  Trump  Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong  Illegals out 
Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq were caused by me  I had NOTHING to do with story 
The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women  when they know that it is just the opposite 
The media is so after me on women Wow  this is a tough business  Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump 

@Tytan01: Dear @CNN  after doing a quick Google & Twitter search there are over 15 000 women's groups supporting DonaldTrump  Stop Lying  


@theAgeofLeo: Your instincts on foreign policy & terrorism have been better than all of these so called experienced politicians combined  
Top suspect in Paris massacre  Salah Abdeslam  who also knew of the Brussels attack  is no longer talking  Weak leaders  ridiculous laws 

Wow  just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me  How am I still number one by a lot  
I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania  he did  He knew the PAC was putting it out hence  Lyin' Ted 
Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it  If I lost monster story 



Europe and the U S  must immediately stop taking in people from Syria  This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it So sad 
Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe  Also  many in U S  I TOLD YOU SO I alone can fix this problem 
@Doctor_S_Freud: @TheView They're all brain dead puppets with skeletons in their closet  I say you go on and destroy them all A dead show 
Explain how the women on The View  which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left  ever got their jobs  @abc is wasting time 
 @TheView T V  show  which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air  is constantly asking me to go on  I TELL THEM NO 
Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years  TIME FOR A CHANGE  I WILL SOLVE AND FAST 

It is amazing how often I am right  only to be criticized by the media  Illegal immigration  take the oil  build the wall  Muslims  NATO 
Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a hell hole and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article  I was so right 
These politicians like Cruz and Graham  who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years  do nothing to make things better 
 @LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike ALL TALK AND NO ACTION Both talk about ISIS  do nothing 
It is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T V  shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run 
@missi51:  @realDonaldTrump thank God is not a politician  but he's one heck of a fighter who will fight for us  the people  
We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N A T O  Why  It is time to renegotiate  and the time is now 
N A T O  is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on 

@Kj11100Me: @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump will be greater president than Ragan  Trump will set the button for morality Christianity  
@tcsorr: @jphilman0206 @realDonaldTrump self funded and media loves him  Not beholden to masters like @tedcruz  Who owns Ted  

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
I want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win  Could not have done it without you Joe 
While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates  it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race 
I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted  Jeb spent more than $150 000 000 and got nothing  I spent a fraction of that and am first 
I will be the best by far in fighting terror  I’m the only one that was right from the beginning  & now Lyin’ Ted & others are copying me  
Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror  She’s been in office fighting terror for 20 years and look where we are 
Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates  Lyin’ Ted Cruz  Honestly  I can’t blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion 
Lyin’ Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me  and lines from Michael Douglas— just another dishonest politician  

Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G Q  model photo post of Melania  That's why we call him Lyin' Ted 
Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November  paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices 
Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona  Thank you  I will never forget 

Incompetent Hillary  despite the horrible attack in Brussels today  wants borders to be weak and open and let the Muslims flow in  No way 
Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G Q  shoot in his ad  Be careful  Lyin' Ted  or I will spill the beans on your wife 

Obama  and all others  have been so weak  and so politically correct  that terror groups are forming and getting stronger Shame  





I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody and it’s not even close  Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba  especially in the shadows of Brussels  He is being treated badly 
Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was  Not anymore  it is from a different world U S  must be vigilant and smart 

@BarronG510: @realDonaldTrump The media is corrupt We The People are fighting with you  
Wow  President Obama just landed in Cuba  a big deal  and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him  He greeted Pope and others  No respect 
Big Republican Dinner tonight at Mar a Lago in Palm Beach  I will be there 
@gamzorz: @megynkelly Dont worry Trump  They are losing thousands of viewers and money  Roger Ailes will be telling Megyn to stop 
So the highly overrated anchor  @megynkelly  is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show  but I can't fight back  Wrong 
The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday  delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours  and the media blames my supporters 
Why is it that the horrendous protesters  who scream  curse punch  shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES  are never blamed by media  SAD 
Will be interviewed on @ThisWeekABC this morning  Enjoy 
@GStephanopoulos: What’s @realDonaldTrump's strategy to secure the GOP nomination  I’ll talk to the Republican front runner  @ThisWeekABC  
The rallies in Utah and Arizona were great Tremendous crowds and spirit  Just returned but will be going back soon  
@jojo2foxy: TRUMP IS NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING OR ANYONE THAT'S THE PRESIDENT USA NEEDS TO UNITE US & KNOCK THE SOCKS OFF OUR ENEMIES 






Wow  @CNN ratings are up 75% because it's all Trump  all the time  The networks are making a fortune off of me MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 

If crazy @megynkelly didn't cover me so much on her terrible show  her ratings would totally tank  She is so average in so many ways 
Crazy @megynkelly says I don't (won't) go on her show and she still gets good ratings  But almost all of her shows are negative hits on me 



@Ma1973sk: Actually  no @FoxNews  @megynkelly has a sick obsession with Trump  Every day  every show  trashing  negative  hate  




@cmichaeld2004: Realistic Trump Poll Numbers translate to the 70 percentile range in a two man race  Gee  what happened to that 30% ceiling 
@ileanabarkus: @nytdavidbrooks I totally agree @nytdavidbrooks is strictly conceptual and theoretical and has NO COMMONSENSE 


Reading @nytdavidbrooks of the NY Times is a total waste of time  he is a clown with no awareness of the world around him dummy 
While I have never met @nytdavidbrooks of the NY Times  I consider him one of the dumbest of all pundits he has no sense of the real world 

Watching @loudobbsnews fantastic show Has very interesting take on Paul Ryan  
Just leaving Salt Lake City  Utah fantastic crowd with no interruptions  Love Utah will be back 
Why haven't they released the final Missouri victory for us yet  Could it be because Cruz's guy runs Missouri  

Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants  She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets 
Everybody should boycott the @megynkelly show  Never worth watching  Always a hit on Trump She is sick  & the most overrated person on tv  


Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue  No wonder he lost 
Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich & Marco Rubio  and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz  1/2 
Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney  the man who choked and let us all down  is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz  This is good for me 
Going to Salt Lake City  Utah  for a big rally  Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there Mormons don't like LIARS I beat Hillary 

Club For Growth tried to extort $1 000 000 from me  When I said NO  they went hostile with negative ads  Disgraceful 
With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment  my numbers continue to go up  Can anyone explain this  
 @EWErickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me  
Senator @LindseyGrahamSC made horrible statements about @SenTedCruz – and then he endorsed him  No wonder nobody trusts politicians 
Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday and he was just given the jinx a Lindsey Graham endorsement  Also backed Jeb  Lindsey got 0 

Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 

Highly overrated & crazy @megynkelly is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me  Focus on others Megyn 
Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio  Two more days and Ohio was mine 
See you in Arizona on Friday and Saturday https://twitter com/FoxBusiness/status/710488907121438720 … 
Please explain to the dummies at the @WSJ Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won  according to Drudge etc   all 11 of them 
 @WSJ is bad at math  The good news is  nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore  especially me 
 @WSJ Editorial says Clinton primary vote total is 8 646 551 Trump's is 7 533 692 a knock  But she had only 3 opponents I had 16 Apologize 
The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars a big problem 
Crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me Tough 
Great news that @FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate  How many times can the same people ask the same question  I beat Cruz debating 
Crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night  Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse  Ted can't win 
Stuart Stevens  the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss  is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump  Sad 
I will be interviewed on The O'Reilly Factor this evening at 8 pm on the Fox News Channel  @oreillyfactor 

Wow  just won Missouri 
I am making a big speech the night of the @FoxNews debate  but I wish everyone well  Yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins 
Thank you to the Governor of Florida  Rick Scott  for your endorsement  I greatly appreciate your support 
In the last 2 weeks  I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida & I won in a massive landslide The establishment should save their $$ 
Yesterday was amazing—5 victories  Lyin’ Ted Cruz had zero  Things are going very well 

 @RepTomMarino Great job on television this morning  Glad to have you on my side 
@FoxBusiness:  @RepTomMarino: I think @realDonaldTrump can beat HillaryClinton  And I'm looking forward to Trump being president  
 @pastormarkburns You were great last night and we all very much appreciate it Thank you 
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:30 A M  ENJOY 
Will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 7:40  ENJOY 
Will be interviewed on @NewDay on @CNN at 7:15 A M  
Will be interviewed on @GMA at 7:00 A M  Big wins last night 
@lucyric13835428: @realDonaldTrump @megynkelly That's funny  I switched to other media too  can't stand her 


I only wish my wonderful daughter Tiffany could have been with us at Mar a Lago for our great election victory  She is a winner 


Watching other networks and local news  Really good night Crazy @megynkelly is unwatchable  


Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore  Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race  With two people  big & over 
@DumpFoxNews: @FoxNews @megynkelly If media wasn't so biased against Trump  he would've won all of the delegates  
@SCNAK45: @megynkelly is trying so hard to bash @realDonaldTrump it's ridiculous Don't worry  everyone is wise to Crazy Megyn 

@jsconlon11: @BertShad @Foxnews @megynkelly I tried to give them a shot tonight  but they have the whole anti Trump cheerleading team  
@gregens21: @BertShad @FoxNews @megynkelly She's choking on the results Call her justifiable Kelly  Justifying everything she says  

Word is that  despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads  I had a massive victory in Florida  Numbers out soon 
A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida  Hope this is false  
I will bring our jobs back to the U S   and keep our companies from leaving  Nobody else can do it  Our economy will sing again  
In presidential voting so far  John Kasich is ZERO for 22  So why would he be a good candidate  Hillary would beat him  I will beat Hillary 
Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico  now losing Ford (and many others)  Kasich is weak on illegal immigration  We need strong borders now 
Watching John Kasich being interviewed acting so innocent and like such a nice guy  Remember him in second debate  until I put him down  

North Carolina lost 300 000 manufacturing jobs and Ohio lost 400 000 since 2000  Going to Mexico etc  NO MORE IF I WIN  WE WILL BRING BACK 


Don't reward Mitt Romney  who let us all down in the last presidential race  by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA  open borders etc )  
Please remember  I am the ONLY candidate who is self funding his campaign  Kasich  Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists 
I will bring our jobs back to America  fix our military and take care of our vets  end Common Core and ObamaCare  protect 2nd A  build WALL 
Rubio is weak on illegal immigration  with the worst voting record in the U S  Senate in many years  He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Kasich voted for NAFTA  a disaster for Ohio  and now wants the even worse TPP approved  Vote Trump and end this madness 


@realwwshelton: @loudobbsnews I believe that @realDonaldTrump will be the big winner tomorrow  Thank you 
@BrazielCarol: @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Who started this mess  the protesters of course   And media made it worse  



Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA  which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard bad for American workers 

Look forward to being in Tampa this afternoon  Wonderful crowds  Thank you  Florida 


LYIN' TEDpic twitter com/Q0qXDGCN1l 
The failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers  They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check  Really bad people 
Because Gov  Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania he cannot win the nomination & should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue  


Gov Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television  he only watches the @GolfChannel 
Ohio Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA  from which Ohio has never recovered  Now he wants TPP  which will be even worse  Ohio steel and coal dying 
Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events  Be careful Bernie  or my supporters will go to yours 
@alextrent4: It is repulsive that Trump was assaulted politicians used that 2 further themselves 2 further victimize Trump DISGUSTING 
Wow  Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania  not enough signatures  Big problem 

Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core In other words  education of your children from D C  No way 


It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago and then they say I must talk to my people  Phony politicians 
The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump and that is fact 
We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida on behalf of little Marco Rubio  No way to run a country 
Word is early voting in FL is very dishonest  Little Marco  his State Chairman  & their minions are working overtime trying to rig the vote  


MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
On my way to Dayton  Ohio  Will be there soon 
The rally in Cincinnati is ON  Media put out false reports that it was cancelled  Will be great love you Ohio 
Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U S  If it were not for striking oil  they would be bust Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud 
Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio a disaster from which it never recovered  Kasich is good for Mexico 
The organized group of people  many of them thugs  who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago  have totally energized America 


It means so much to me receiving an endorsement from Phyllis Schlafly  A truly great woman & conservative pic twitter com/11rEMu99qc

Dr  Ben Carson I concur  I believe in God who can change people he can make any of us better  @RealBenCarson 





Wow  you are all correct about @FoxNews totally biased and disgusting reporting  


Phony Club For Growth tried to shake me down for one million dollars  & is now putting out nasty negative ads on me  They are total losers 

This was a great evening I would like to thank everyone for their wonderful support  




Word is I am doing very well in Michigan and Mississippi Wow  and with all that money spent against me Will be going to Trump Jupiter now 
I hear @NBCNews / @WSJ came out with another one of their phony polls  While I am leading  they are totally discredited after last S C  poll 






Mitt Romney had his chance and blew it  Lindsey Graham ran for president  got ZERO  and quit Why are they now spokesmen against me  Sad 
Remember  I am the only one who is self funding my campaign  All of the other candidates are bought and paid for by special interests 
Sun Sentinel says: Rubio lacks the experience  work ethic and gravitas needed to be president  HE HAS NOT EARNED YOUR VOTE 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 


The Club for Growth is a very dishonest group  They represent conservative values terribly & are bad for America http://thehill com/blogs/ballot box/272013 club for growth action spends 2 million on anti trump ads …

Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio features Trump Univ  students in FL  attack ads who submitted excellent reviews https://www youtube com/watch v=QqfsbQGPLAE … 

It was great being in Michigan  Remember  I am the only presidential candidate who will bring jobs back to the U S and protect car industry 
Don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight Rubio and the R establishment  Dishonest people 
Leaving for North Carolina  Big crowd  will be fun 
Congratulation to Adam Scott and all of the folks at Trump National Doral on producing a really great WGC Tournament  Amazing finish 
I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio  A record no show in Senate  he is scamming Florida 
We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT  who could not stop Obama (twice)  ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of $'s in false ads 
Lindsey Graham is all over T V   much like failed 47% candidate Mitt Romney  These nasty  angry  jealous failures have ZERO credibility 
Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me  I destroyed his run  brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out  Now nasty 
How do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians  I will be using Facebook & Twitter  Watch 
All of the phony T V  commercials against me are bought and payed for by SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS  the bandits that tell your pols what to do 


 @meetthepress and @chucktodd did a 1 hour hit job on me today – totally biased and mostly false  Dishonest media 
I am at Trump National Doral best resort in U S  Rory and Adam Scott are doing great Watch on NBC at 3:00 P M  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 


The primary plaintiff in the phony Trump University suit wants to abandon the case  Disgraceful 
Nancy Reagan  the wife of a truly great President  was an amazing woman  She will be missed 
David Brooks  of the New York Times  is closing in on being the dumbest of them all  He doesn’t have a clue  


I will be interviewed on @FaceTheNation this morning  Enjoy @jdickerson 
 @FoxNews is devastated that lightweight Senator Marco Rubio got trounced tonight and is the big loser  I won the two big states  great 


I will be at the Cadillac World Golf Championship @TrumpDoral in Miami tomorrow Rory  Phil  Bubba  Adam  and Dustin all at the top 



Romney's failed advisors  like campaign mgr Stuart Stevens are all over TV telling people how to win  But they lost don't know how to win 
 @MittRomney was a disaster candidate who had no guts and choked Romney is a total joke  and everyone knows it 
Thank you  Kansas The line going into the Orlando event is over a mile long  Massive crowd expected  Leaving Kansas now  be there soon

Rubio puts out ad that my pilot was a drug dealer not true  not my pilot Guy owned helicopter company don't think I ever even used  




Go to Trump Doral in Miami and watch the World Golf Championship On NOW 

@CreativeXwalk: @realDonaldTrump teaching the GOP how to lose four years ago was not enough  Now Romney wants to do it again  
The phony lawsuit against Trump U could have been easily settled by me but I want to go to court  98% approval rating by students  Easy win 
Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago  
I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton  I am not a Mitt Romney  who doesn't know how to win  Hillary wants no part of Trump 
Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who  as a Senator  never even shows up to vote worst record  Marco Rubio is a joke 
I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party  while the Dems are going down  Establishment wants to kill this movement 
Failed candidate Mitt Romney who ran one of the worst races in presidential history is working with the establishment to bury a big R win 
@malski1954: I changed parties to vote for you  no one else measures up to you  The GOPe needs a reality check  Our country is at stake 
Looks like two time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected  Not a good messenger 
Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio & Cruz When you see them think of your puppet POLS 
@Johnsmi01433966: The establishment doesn't like you because they can't control you and get you to lie to us and keep ripping us off  
Because of me  the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters  a record  If they are not careful  they will all leave  Sad 


Just another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten Barrack Obama  (2/2) 
Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney is having a news conference tomorrow to criticize me  (1/2) 

 @CNN poll just hit 49% for Trump  Interesting how my numbers have gone so far up since lightweight Marco Rubio has turned nasty  Love it 

Why can't the leaders of the Republican Party see that I am bringing in new voters by the millions we are creating a larger  stronger party 

@KinnardJan: @Itsjoeco @realDonaldTrump I took Trump University class and saved my home 
Marco Rubio lost big last night  I even beat him in Virginia  where he spent so much time and money  Now his bosses are desperate and angry 
Why would anyone in Florida vote for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio  Check out his credit card scam  his house sale & his no show voting 
The special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T V  ads on me  
@JoeNBC: FOX calls Virginia for Trump  If it holds  it's a big win for Trump and a big setback for Rubio  who needed to win the state  

@NorahODonnell: Looks like Rubio won't get any delegates from TX or AL because he didn't meet 20% threshold  

@danpfeiffer: For the record  most Democrats would much rather face Cruz than Trump So true 









MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 

The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley 
Got the endorsement of Brian France and @NASCAR yesterday in Georgia  Also  many of the sports great drivers  Thank you Nascar and Georgia

While Hillary and I both won South Carolina by big margins  Repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles GROWING PARTY 
The Republican Establishment has been pushing for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio to say anything to hit Trump I signed the pledge careful 
While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil)  word is they have chosen little Marco Rubio  the lightweight from Florida 

@JimmyTheSaint09: @realDonaldTrump @RonnieMemo @ChrisChristie anything is better than @marcorubio

Just watched lightweight Marco Rubio lying to a small crowd about my past record  He is not as smart as Cruz  and may be an even bigger liar 
 #RogerStone was just banned by @CNN their loss Tough  loyal guy  
I started my business with very little and built it into a great company  with some of the best real estate assets in the World  Amazing 
I only wish my wonderful father  Fred  gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says  He didn't total fabrication 
Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version amazing people 
I am self funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz 
Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit  After the audit  no problem 
I unfairly get audited by the I R S  almost every single year  I have rich friends who never get audited  I wonder why  

I will be on @foxandfriends at 8:30 A M  Will be talking about lightweight Marco Rubio and lying Ted Cruz 
@SassyPantsjj: Michigan GOP poll 2/24/2016 Trump 35 5 Rubio 15 0 Cruz 14 3 Kasich 12 8 Carson 8 3 @realDonaldTrump Wow 


@itsblakec: @realDonaldTrump Trump is a genius  Rubio and Cruz are not  I want a brilliant mind to run this country  
@donnieboysmith: @realDonaldTrump in contrast to Rubio and Cruz you look like a giant  They look terribly weak Thank you 




They don't like Rubio in Florida he left them high & dry  Doesn't even show up for votes 
Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night  The problem is  he is a choker  and once a choker  always a choker Mr  Meltdown  
Wow  every poll said I won the debate last night  Great honor 
Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage  Not presidential material 
Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement  They failed 
Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A M  Big crowd get there early Big announcement to be made 
Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit 
Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday  Cruz is a nasty guy  not one Senate endorsement and  despite talk  gets nothing done  Loser 
I will be making a speech at 12:00 in Fort Worth  Texas  Really big crowd expected  Will be talking about the debate last night plus  plus 
@WaltSeher: @realDonaldTrump @morg25016893 @eventbrite yup 200 Polish immigrants were hired by his contractor not Trump 
@MJP1370: @realDonaldTrump Cruz talks about Hillary all the time because he knows he can't beat you Trump will win Texas 
@donell27743094: @realDonaldTrump trump won the debate  Disgusting Rubio said peed is he still in junior high school  
@tdltdltdltdl: Marco Cruz and Ted Rubio (easy to get the two politicians confused) looked like desperate  panicked DC insiders tonight 
@SkylerDeckard: @realDonaldTrump that's because you've never hired anyone to do work before favorite line from tonights debate  
@restorereality: Tonight you proved to America you are the real deal  You took fire from all sides  stayed composed  returned fire and WON 
@Slytle24: @davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump @CNN he won almost all polls and Mark Halperin gave him an A 

@morg25016893: @eventbrite Also  all the things Rubio&Cruz were using for hits  just petty  Trump  clearly the only one w/all the skills  

All the online polls have me winning the debate  I really enjoyed the evening  Not easy  but good http://thehill com/blogs/ballot box/presidential races/270873 trump leads post debate online polls … 




Failed presidential candidate @MittRomney was made to look like a fool by Senator Harry Reid & didn't release his tax returns until 9/21/12  

FMR PRES of Mexico  Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall  He must apologize If I did that there would be a uproar 
Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn't win South Carolina  it's over  He didn't win and lost to me in a landslide 


I'm going to do what @MittRomney was totally unable to do WIN 

Signing a recent tax return isn't this ridiculous pic twitter com/UdwqF4iZIZ 
Just for your info  tax returns have 0 to do w/ someone’s net worth  I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC  They are great 
Why doesn’t @MittRomney just endorse @marcorubio already  Should have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway  Too late now 
Mitt Romney  who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics  is now pushing me on tax returns  Dope 

@ChatteringTeef: @BornToBeGOP @realDonaldTrump @MittRomney hates to see Trump's success when he was so pathetic 
@classyexplorer: @ahernandez85a Romney is a pawn of the Establishment and has no individual thought process  He is jealous of Trump 
@conservativevin: @ahernandez85a Romney should have been a tough guy with Obama  He cowered and lost  BADLY He's not relevant 
@Stevekwebb: @realDonaldTrump Love it @tedcruz is done  We need someone who is proven  @realDonaldTrump will make America Great Again 

@HosierN: @foxnewspolitics A vote for @tedcruz or @marcorubio is a vote for corruption  special interests and lobbyists  Trump for POTUS 



@GriceCindy: That's why we are angry  The Republican Establishment will not support you  You are who the American people want 
@ddpick18: @realDonaldTrump This Texan will be voting Trump March 1st  Cruz is a fake Texan 
 @RepChrisCollins Chris  thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement  I will not let you down @CNN 
When Ted Cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear  I will get most of his votes no problem 
Why would Texans vote for liar Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada  lived there for 4 years and remained a Canadian citizen until recently 
When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around  he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win 

Mitt Romney who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool  is now playing tough guy 
The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters  That is how I got to 46%  When others drop out  I will pick up more  Sad but true 

In all of television the only one who said anything bad about last nights landslide victory was dopey @KarlRove  He should be fired 


 @USATODAY Poll and @QuinnipiacPoll say that I beat both Hillary and Bernie  and I havn't even started on them yet 
Big defeat last night in Nevada for Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio  @KarlRove on @FoxNews is working hard to belittle my victory  Rove is sick 
@MELANIATRUMP did great on television this morning  Poised  smart and strong  with a big heart so much to offer  We are all proud of you 
Melania will be interviewed by @morningmika on @Morning_Joe now (8:30 A M )  ENJOY 


Make sure you get on the Trump line and are not mislead by the Cruz people  They are bad BE CAREFUL  

GO VOTE FROM NOW TO 8:30 P M  NEVADA  I WILL BE AT VARIOUS CAUCUS SITES  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
My wife Melania will be on @Morning_Joe tomorrow morning at 8:00  Interviewed by @morningmika Enjoy 

Club for Growth is the group that came to my office seeking $1 million dollars  I told them no and now they are doing negative ads  
Great  Just reported on @FoxNews that many people who supported @JebBush are now supporting me  I knew that would happen  pundits didn't 
Wow  great Ohio poll  Shows me leading by 5 points  beating K 
Unlike the other Republican candidates  I will be in Nevada all day and night I won't be fleeing  in and out  I love & invest in Nevada 

@StevenMeyers11: @Vogelsong1 @EdRollins @FoxNews Ed Rollins is the only one of those people that understands process & gets it right 
I am growing the Republican Party tremendously just look at the numbers  way up Democrats numbers are significantly down from years past  
@jojo2foxy: TRUMP IS UNSTOPPABLE    HE IS WHAT COMMON SENSE AMERICANS WANT WHETHER REPUBLICAN  INDEPENDENT OR A REAGAN DEMOCRAT  
@Vogelsong1: @EdRollins gets it  Was just on @FoxNews explaining how Trump wins the general election  Thank you Ed 
Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog over and over again The Evangelicals in S C  figured him out & said no 
Ted Cruz does not have the right temperment to be President  Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm  BAD 
Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication  He used him as a scape goat fired like a dog Ted panicked  
Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S C  He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration  


Ted Cruz said on @oreillyfactor that illegals sent out of country by my administration would come right back as citizens  Another lie crazy 
A big fat hit job on @oreillyfactor tonight  A total waste of time to watch  boring and biased  @brithume said I would never run  a dope 
Great Town Hall tonight at 10:00 P M  (Eastern) conducted by @seanhannity on @FoxNews 




Just watched the very incompetent Mitt Romney Campaign Strategist  Stuart Stevens  Now I know why Mitt lost so badly  Stevens is a clown 


Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa  Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen Sad  
Just saw the phony ad by Cruz totally false  more dirty tricks  He got caught in so many lies is this man crazy  
Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks  No wonder he has lost Evangelical support 
Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false no basis in fact  Take ad down Ted  Biggest liar in politics 
Wow  Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director  More dirty tricks 
It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve  and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done  

Many people are now saying I won South Carolina because of the last debate  I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry 

@ScotMReed: No matter what liar sleazeball @rickwtyler says about @tedcruz in Tennessee  We have early voting and @realDonaldTrump has won  
I hear the Rickets family  who own the Chicago Cubs  are secretly spending $'s against me  They better be careful  they have a lot to hide 
@1sonny12: @KSmith233035 @mitchellvii FLORIDIANS ARE UPSET BECAUSE RUBIO DID NOT DO WHAT HE PROMISED ONCE HE WAS ELECTED VOTE TRUMP 
@gregusp61: You really rocked them hard in S C  Rubio and Cruz were pummled  So glad Jeb is gone Next no liar 
The reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in S C  is because he is a world class LIAR  and Evangelicals do not like liars 
I am in Las Vegas  at the best hotel (by far)  Trump International  I will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to WIN Nevada 

A number of months ago  I was not expected to win South Carolina Ted Cruz was  and yet I won in a landslide every group and category  WIN 


A quote was read from a parody account last night on MSNBC re: Jeb https://twitter com/Lawrence/status/701261627065294851 … 
The failing @WSJ Wall Street Journal should fire both its pollster and its Editorial Board  Seldom has a paper been so wrong Totally biased 
I will be live on all of the major morning talk shows  Enjoy 
Thank you @SarahPalinUSA for your amazing help and support  Big win  leaving now for Atlanta and Nevada The people of South Carolina got it 

What a great night  Thank you South Carolina  a special place with truly amazing people LOVE 
People (pundits) gave me no chance in South Carolina  Now it looks like a possible win  I would be happy with a one vote victory (HOPE) 
@CarrollKuykend2: This veteran just voted @realDonaldTrump in the SC primary  let's make America great again 
South Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands  Vote now (today)  and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Remember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration  South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in  Don't allow it 
I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque  Very sad that he did not go 
@Carolyn82471448: @WayneDupreeShow @realDonaldTrump All aboard the Trump Train 

I am the only candidate (in many years) who is self funding his campaign  Lobbyists and $ interests totally control all other candidates 

@BirgitOlsen1: @realDonaldTrump @Justice41ca @Vote_For_Trump EVERYBODY ON TWITTER GET OUT TO VOTE FOR TRUMP TODAY IN SOUTH CAROLINA 








@dnmiller2000: @realDonaldTrump I'm a Regan Dem and believe in your message God bless you and your campaign 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Just finished two major speeches in South Carolina  Big crowds  great people  Going for a third now 
Boycott all Apple products until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal 
Hopefully others will follow suit  Our country needs & should demand security  It is time to get tough & be smart 
I use both iPhone & Samsung  If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info  




I’m self funding and I am going to take care of the people – not the special interests and insurance companies like the other candidates  
I will replace it with private plans  health savings accounts  & allow purchasing across state lines  Maximum choice & freedom for consumer  
I was referring to a backstop for pre existing conditions  I will eliminate the law  in its entirety  & replace it w/ something much better  



@KathyTravels777: ĺ @andersoncooper Tonight on CNN @realDonaldTrump was GREAT  Loved the intimacy of conversation w the people 





I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar 
 @FoxNews is changing their theme from fair and balanced to unfair and unbalanced  But dying @WSJ is worse Their phony poll is a joke 



New CBS National Poll just out massive lead for Trump  The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke  No wonder WSJ is doing so badly 
I love being in South Carolina  We are leading big in all of the State polls Saturday is a BIG day  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
The just out USA Today National Poll  where I lead by big numbers  shows that in a head to head matchup  I beat both Hillary and Bernie  
Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls  the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll  




Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses  He wants to look cool  but it's far too late  1% in Nevada 
Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1%  he should take his dumb mouthpiece  @LindseyGrahamSC  and just go home  
 @FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting  They do not want Trump to win  All negative 
I will beat Hillary easily  but Lindsey Graham says I won't  and yet he got zero against me no cred Why does FOX put him on  
 @lindseygraham  who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace saying the most horrible things about me on @FoxNews  
Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I would never be president This from perhaps the worst president in U S  history 


Why does @megynkelly devote so much time on her shows to me  almost always negative  Without me her ratings would tank  Get a life Megyn 

Thank you @kayleighmcenany for your nice words great knowledge and style We are doing really well in South Carolina  @CNN @donlemon 
@Good2bqueen67: @brithume @megynkelly They're too lame to get it  Sir  When you win the election they'll get it  
 @brithume thinks that when Republicans drop out of the race  someone will pick up ALL of that vote  The fact is I will get much of it 
Explain to @brithume and @megynkelly  who know nothing  that I will beat Hillary and win states (and dem indie votes) that no other R can 






New PPP Poll just out Trump up big  Cruz  Rubio and Bush down  The debate results  even with a stacked RNC audience  were wonderful 
Spent the full day at meetings and a major rally yesterday in South Carolina  Great people and spirit  Today will be more of the same  






I'd like to call JEB a liar  but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used Eminent Domain when criticizing me (1/2) 
Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb( )  is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center  Iraq War and eco collapse  Careful 
I will be in South Carolina all week  Saturday is BIG  BIG  BIG Get out and vote MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates  Hillary would destroy them  Ted may not be eligible to run born in Canada 
Funny that Jeb( ) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name Then mommy  now brother 
Ted Cruz  along with Jeb Bush  pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court  Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice  but didn't 
Wow  in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties Thank you 
Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests the bosses 
Loved the debate last night  and almost everyone said I won  but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution  All donors & special ints 

I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning  Enjoy 
This shows what a complete & total liar Ted Cruz is he said he wouldn't have nominated John Roberts  Really http://www nationalreview com/article/214989/right stuff ted cruz … 
@autumnandews08: @realDonaldTrump @JebBush Jeb is incompetent and will lose  don't waste your energy on that cry baby 
Even though every poll  Time  Drudge etc   has me winning the debate by a lot  @FoxNews only puts negative people on  Biased a total joke 
@jeffpaine: @realDonaldTrump you crushed the debate Thank you 



All polls have me winning debate big Drudge  TIME  etc  Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty  He has zero cred totally dishonest 

Thank you I miss my father https://twitter com/eustacefash/status/698735409501757440 … 


Ted Cruz is a cheater He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts 
Nasty Ted Cruz is at it again same dirty tricks he used w/ @RealBenCarson saying I may not be on ballot & I hold liberal positions  LIES 
Wow Honored to be chosen by the highly respected accurate Washington & Lee Mock Convention  I hope you are right I will make you proud 
The totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY 
Love the people of South Carolina look very much forward to the debate tonight  

@ThtsWhtKelSaid: I'm fed up w/ DC playing 3 card Monty w/ our tax $'s  It's time we the people play the Trump card  & take back our country 





@Elvisfan1976: @NRSC stop sending me emails asking me to donate and get a free DonaldTrump sticker  I support him and he's self funding 
@dj4k4000: @realDonaldTrump @CNN Trump will be our next POTUS  every American will benefit positivey from this  
@nellalda: @DonaldJTrump45 @realDonaldTrump @Reince They are all going crazy We the people do not care at all We are with Trump 

A very big thank you to Bill Donohue  head of The Catholic League  for the wonderful interview on @CNN and article in Newsmax Great insight 

The RNC  which is probably not on my side  just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC  
Now an additional 600 700 jobs in America (2 000) being eliminated for move to Mexico via Hartford Courant pic twitter com/bOIYQLqGRG 


Just got back from Tampa  It was an amazing evening with an even more amazing crowd fantastic people Will be in South Carolina tomorrow  
Word is that little Morty Zuckerman’s @NYDailyNews loses more than $50 million per year can that be possible  
When little Morty Zuckerman closes his failing @NYDailyNews will I at least be given some credit  Will happen soon  
11 000 inside venue tonight in Tampa Broke record set by Elton John in 1988 w/out musical instruments Another 5 000 outside  Will be back 


Millions of $'s of false ads  paid for by lobbyists special interests of cheater @SenTedCruz and sleepy @JebBush  are now running in S C  
@copyover2001: @realDonaldTrump Do Americans really want a Canadian born president  First non native born in history  
@by @tedcruz good I want to see the court decide what I was always told natural born means born on American soil 

Last time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself  If he doesn't do better this time  he is out 
If @TedCruz doesn’t clean up his act  stop cheating  & doing negative ads  I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen  
Lightweight @JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC  False advertising desperate and sad 
After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me  they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect & ill informed ads  
Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution  which naturally  they did not get  

The failing @NYDailyNews  destroyed by little Morty Zuckerman  is preparing to close and save face by going online  It's dead 

How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest  
Lying Cruz put out a statement  “Trump & Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage  Cruz is the worst liar  crazy or very dishonest  Perhaps all 3  
Weak JEB getting thrown out by management during speech  Do you think he will be this tough on Putin & others https://www youtube com/watch v=9OE_lHQZGuM … 


Cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w/ @RealBenCarson  How can he preach Christian values http://www politico com/story/2016/02/donald trump ted cruz south carolina push polls 219158#ixzz3zuAXvW83 … 
@truthinvest: @CNN @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Ted Cruz is the definition of sleaze  Just ask @RealBenCarson 

We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest pushpolls on me  We are watching 
Jeb failed as Jeb He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq)  Spent $120 million Weak no chance 
He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Remember  it was the Republican Party  with the help of Conservatives  that made so many promises to their base  BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM Hi DT 
 @MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word  I never said the word  left an open blank  Please apologize 
Jeb Bush spent more than $40 000 000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5  I spent $3 000 000 to come in 1st  Big difference in capability 
There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking  It is bleeding red ink a total loser 
I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core  Get rid of Common Core keep education local 

@HARyder: Which is it @realDonaldTrump  Are you planning on getting rid of Common Core or keeping it  Get rid of it fast  
I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core  
Big speech tonight in South Carolina 7:00 P M  Tremendous crowd 
So funny  Jeb Bush called me a highly gifted politician and a great entertainer I assume that is a compliment 
Such a great experience in New Hampshire amazing people Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today  
Like the worthless @NYDailyNews  looks like @politico will be going out of business  Bad reporting no money  no cred 
Worthless @NYDailyNews  which dopey Mort Zuckerman  is desperately trying to sell  has no buyer Liabilities are massive 
Dopey Mort Zuckerman  owner of the worthless @NYDailyNews  has a major inferiority complex  Paper will close soon 
@MarkHalperin: My report card grades for the 2 New Hampshire winners: DonaldTrump A: v strong energy/close  BernieSanders B : went too long 
Thank you to the people of New Hampshire  I love you Now  off to South Carolina  

We will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into New Hampshire from our open southern border  We will build a WALL and have security  
We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare and nobody can do that like me  We will save $'s and have much better healthcare 
ISIS is making big threats today no respect for U S A  or our leader If I win it will be a very different story with very fast results 
New Hampshire vote today MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 



MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:40  A M  Enjoy 
The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION  States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me  Great 
No one has done more for people with disabilities than me  I have spent many millions of dollars to help out and am happy to have done so 
I know the Governors and Jeb Bush  who has gone nasty with lies  is by far the weakest of the lot  His family used private eminent domain 
Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D C ) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ( come as act of love )  Not a leader 



Now that Bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign  he says he would end super PACs  Sad 


Everybody is laughing at Jeb Bush spent $100 million and is at bottom of pack  A pathetic figure 


Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad  He is a weak candidate 
My two wonderful sons  Don and Eric  will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 now Enjoy  
So far the Super Bowl is very boring not nearly as exciting as politics MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 



We are going to have a big event at the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester  New Hampshire 5K Join us tomorrow:https://www eventbrite com/e/donald j trump in manchester nh tickets 20922675285 …

@JoeNBC: Trump just talked on MSNBC like a man who knows he had a very good night  


@newtgingrich: Trump shows courage in defending eminent domain as a necessity for construction of infrastructure 
@newtgingrich: Trump hits it out of the park in describing effective deal making 
@JoeNBC: Trump  Kasich  Jeb and Christie all had good nights  
@JoeNBC: Latest UMass Tracking Poll  NH GOP Trump 35 ( 1) Rubio 14 ( 1) Cruz 13 ( 1) Jeb 10 ( 2) Kasich 10 ( 2)

@MarkHalperin: My debate report card: Christie A   Trump A   Bush B   Kasich B   Cruz B  Carson C  Rubio D  Full report cards here  
@JoeNBC: Cruz really seems out of his element in New Hampshire  It is such a different battlefield then Iowa and the South  




I love New Hampshire will be an exciting evening 
@realOllieTaylor: @paintonmy: IA caucus hasn't picked nominee in 16 years Cruz dirty tricks stole it  Trump way ahead in primary states  
@paintonmyjeans: If I owned a big company that was failing  I'd hire DonaldTrump to make it great again Rubio/Cruz wouldnt be considered 
@big_carsonrocks: AMERICA   Stop being duped   WAKE UP Cruz & Rubio establishment phonies  DonaldTrump only truthful & not owned candidate 
@Enlighten2881: @ukcatwoman52 @ericnlin @AC360 How come Rubio&Cruz are going to turn America around but did nothing in the Senate for USA  


@lisabrossman: @ukcatwoman52 @ericnlin @AC360 He is for America Security for America Jobs for America There is no other leader 
Wow  Jeb Bush  whose campaign is a total disaster  had to bring in mommy to take a slap at me  Not nice 

@ukcatwoman52: @ericnlin @AC360 all candidates liars  Trump is the only one that speak the truth people need to hear what Trump is saying  

@ericnlin: @AC360 DonaldTrump: no raise in 8 years  home not worth what I paid for it  healthcare is a joke Obama is a liar  TRUMP 2016 



I told you so  Our country totally lost control of illegal immigration  even with criminals http://www breitbart com/big government/2016/02/04/exclusive immigration committee chart fugitive criminal aliens outnumber all new hampshire city populations/ … 
10 000 people in South Carolina  unbelievable evening Will be in New Hampshire tomorrow love it pic twitter com/tF033Yjhu3 
Really dumb @CheriJacobus  Begged my people for a job  Turned her down twice and she went hostile  Major loser  zero credibility 

@MaryAnn1942: @realDonaldTrump why vote for Trump  Unlike politicians all talk  Trump’s talk materializes He will make America great again 



I very much look forward to tomorrow’s debate in New Hampshire—so many things to say  so much at stake  It will be an incredible evening 

Big storm in New Hampshire  Moved my event to Monday  Will be there next four days  

@rkswaney7: @CNN @realDonaldTrump I agree  Great businessman  I like your tone tonight Keep it up & you'll have this Democrats vote  
Watch @AC360 on NOW @CNN 
I will be interviewed by Anderson Cooper at 8pm on @CNN from New Hampshire  Should be very interesting 


This is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone  a misdemeanor at minimum pic twitter com/tMav17UGkf 
 @oreillyfactor @KarlRove as per the show  an even more serious Cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone  

Thank you @billoreilly & @KarlRove  Ted Cruz should be immediately disqualified in Iowa  with each candidate moving up one notch  
Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me  He would be so easy to beat 



Dr  Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for deceit and dirty tricks and lies  

The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated a total fraud 

I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P M  Enjoy @FoxNews 
Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus  either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified  
And finally  Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and choice a total lie 
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz  Fraud 
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud  Also  Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters  
During primetime of the Iowa Caucus  Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race  and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz  
Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa  he stole it  That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated  Bad 
Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany @cherijacobus begged us for a job  We said no and she went hostile  A real dummy @CNN 

Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long  rambling  overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment 
@stephbewitching @realDonaldTrump All you haters need to realize Trump got the second highest vote in history  And he's never held office 

@ellenEspence @realDonaldTrump Amazing job in Iowa Cruz just barely won  
@93101Dianne @realDonaldTrump if you can do that well in Iowa then I see you acing it in all other significant states  Momentum is growing 
@LoreWestphal @realDonaldTrump You MUST win the Presidency in 2016 
 @Morning_Joe @mikebarnicle on @realDonaldTrump: He finished 2nd but he made the turn successfully like a pro 
I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self funding my campaign  the only one  I will keep doing  but not worth it 
I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media later in New Hampshire  Big crowd 
The media has not covered my long shot great finish in Iowa fairly  Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history 
Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa  I spent very little there a fraction of Cruz & Rubio  Came in a strong second  Great honor 
My experience in Iowa was a great one  I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place  Nice 
It all begins today WE WILL FINALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 





I will be interviewed on Face The Nation with @jdickerson this morning  Enjoy 
I am in Iowa  Will be interviewed on This Week With @GStephanopoulos this morning  ENJOY 
If I would have done the last debate  a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved)  Also  VETS got $6 000 000  
By not doing the failed  poorly rated debate  I was able to make the point of not allowing unfairness while raising $6 000 000 for VETS  
Wow  just saw an ad Cruz is lying on so many levels  There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me  will repeal & replace  He lies 
Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form  Very low interest loans  scam 
Ted Cruz is totally unelectable  if he even gets to run (born in Canada)  Will loose big to Hillary  Polls show I beat Hillary easily WIN 
I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife  Melania  After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State 
 @bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man  When I wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more  he endorsed Cruz  @foxandfriends 
 @bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event  The people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100 000 for himself Phony @foxandfriends 
 @bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy  Asked me for expensive hotel rooms  free (and more)  I said pay and he endorsed Cruz 
The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters in violation  They are now under investigation  Bad 



I will be in Iowa all day and until Tuesday morning  Finally  after all these years of watching stupidity  we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk  Not presidential material 

@gigglemitz: @GeraldoRivera @FoxNews damn fox is really acting like a baby today  I guess Trump got under their skin pretty biased 
@classyexplorer: @oreillyfactor @DRUDGE So Bill if America was SO LONGING to learn more about candidates why the 50 percent audience loss  

 @oreillyfactor The people of Iowa love the fact that I stuck up for my rights  as I will do for the U S  Also got $6 000 000 for our VETS 
 @FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night  $6 000 000 raised in one hour for our VETS  
Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse  who is easy  to endorse him  Not one Senator is endorsing Canada Ted 
 @BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U S  Senator  How the hell did he ever get elected  @greta 
The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator  Saw him on @greta totally ineffective  Wants paid for pols  
The new e mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton  At a minimum  how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president  

They say that if I participated in last night’s Fox debate  they would have had 12 million more & would have broken the all time record  




Thank you Mitchell FOX2 Michigan Poll finds Trump holds 3 1 lead over closest GOP opponents  Trump 47% Clinton 43%pic twitter com/xpaeV0YzGV 

Getting ready to take off for Nashua  New Hampshire  Big crowd  will be there soon  Fun 
Iowa was amazing last night  The event could not have worked out better  We raised $6 000 000 for our great vets  They were so happy & proud 





Thank you for the kind words tonight  @OMAROSA  You were great See you soon 


Watching biased Charles @krauthammer  a @FoxNews flunky who didn't know that I won every debate  in particular the last one  Check polls 


I hear that @SenTedCruz’s $$ man  Robert Mercer  a good man  is very angry because Cruz lied to him about liquidating his (Ted’s) holdings

@chgardens1: @mitchellvii Pathetic attempt to bribe @realDonaldTrump He can't be bought 
The debate tonight will be a total disaster low ratings with advertisers and advertising rates dropping like a rock  I hate to see this  
@laurencristmann: @realDonaldTrump why do they have so many debates this year   Also  why is Cruz still allowed to run  he's not eligible 
@hollywoodJV: @realDonaldTrump Mr  Trump  why does Cruz hate Canada so much  He should embrace his roots  it's a great country So true 
Wow  two candidates called last night and said they want to go to my event tonight at Drake University  

@Rick_Gobbi: @realDonaldTrump    Hold up a mirror so the network cameras show how big the crowd is  GREAT IDEA 
@Plazzmatic: @realDonaldTrump @danpgabriel Sounds like the advertisers want Trump  he knows what he is doing  

@dukeofbc: @megynkelly debate Cruz one on one  I would just tell him that you were to busy running for the President of USA  not Canada 
@CJCboi: @DRJAMESCABOT @realDonaldTrump @DanScavino @Carolde @PlaysTrumpCard Checked YOUR wallet lately  Mr Ailes  

@Davejager1: @creta_r 9 pm channel 70 CNN I will be watching Trump tonight  Want to have a person in the White House that takes no BS  
@HenryOray: @CNNPolitics @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump is fighting corruption  Big donors took over Cruz  No to Donors 

@splashpoint50: @realDonaldTrump Our ReTrumplican Trump support group of 9500 members say 97% will not watch the debate tonight 
@creta_r: @realDonaldTrump Looking forward to watching Donald Trump rally Thursday night on CNN 

On Greta  87% of the people said they would not watch the debate if I'm not in it  Wow what an honor 
FOX debate advertising rates falling like a rock Tune into my special event for the Veterans at 9pm EST 

It was the childishly written & taunting PR statement by Fox that made me not do the debate  more so than lightweight reporter  @megynkelly  
I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 P M  (Eastern)  Enjoy 

Even though I beat him in the first six debates  especially the last one  Ted Cruz wants to debate me again  Can we do it in Canada  
Just got to listen to Rush Limbaugh the guy is fantastic 
The statement put out yesterday by @FoxNews was a disgrace to good broadcasting and journalism  Who would ever say something so nasty & dumb 
I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo  because that would not be politically correct  Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter 







Do you think @SenTedCruz knows about @bobvanderplaats dealings  Actually  I doubt it 

 @bobvanderplaats begged me to do an event while asking organizers for $100 000 for himself—a bad guy 
Great honor Rev  Jerry Falwell Jr  of Liberty University  one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation  has just endorsed me 


Why doesn't phony @bobvanderplaats tell his followers all the times he asked for him and his family to stay at my hotels didn't like paying 

@puttster71: @bobvanderplaats The next president isn't on ur stage  @realDonaldTrump is the next president  
@AynsFriend: @bobvanderplaats CRUZ IS DONE @CNN @ChrisCuomo 
@xXFlame:  @bobvanderplaats Idiot Bob Plaats on CNN is DELUDED Cruz's favorability ratings are 0%  NO ONE LIKES HIM  VOTE TRUMP INSTEAD 


I will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo on @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness at 7:30 A M  Enjoy  
@laurencristmann: @Sharp_Trident @megynkelly it makes me not wanna watch debate because I know they are going to treat Trump unfair 
I will be doing @GMA @GStephanopoulos this morning at around 7:00  Likewise  I will be doing @Morning_Joe at around 7:00  Figure it out 
@Sharp_Trident: A huge disappointment to see @megynkelly constantly attack DonaldTrump  It has become almost unbearable to watch her show  
@WhiteJacketPink: @MyPresidentme @realDonaldTrump just google glenn beck bio  U can tell no education  very poorly written  
@DittoPost: @realDonaldTrump @Crusade4Honesty @BornToBeGOP @megynkelly I believe in Trump 
@Crusade4Honesty: @BornToBeGOP @megynkelly Megan can not contain her bias  it's in every show  Fox owners Saudi Prince agnstT 
@JackBurtonReflx: @jdenino1 @DavidWohl @ss I listen to Glenn Beck and literally nothing he says makes any sense  Same with The View  
@Belizediver88: @CNNSitRoom @CNN @megynkelly It will never happen  Fox will drop Kelly if it means no Trump  Nobody will watch w/o Trump  
@KurtSchlichter: My pal @DavidWohl was just on Megan Kelly's show He digs Trump  Thank you David  you were great

I will be on Morning's with Maria on the Fox Business Network tomorrow during the 7am and 8am ET hours  



I will be on The Situation Room with @wolfblitzer from 5 7pm est on CNN 


It's time for Ted Cruz to either settle his problem with the FACT that he was born in Canada and was a citizen of Canada  or get out of race 
@Rketeltas: Rubio isn't experienced enough to be Commander in Chief  Rubio is a carbon copy of Obama  We need a true leader Vote Trump 
@red77angelluis: @realDonaldTrump @NeilTurner_ @YouTube LET'S GET TRUMP GO TRUMP USA USA 


@Tuggers56: @PMgeezer Hillary is so afraid of him  The GOP is afraid of him  The American people embrace him Let's elect him  DonaldTrump

@noamscheiber: Dow down almost 2000 pts since start of year  but still outperforming Wall Street's investment in Jeb  

@CarolBurnett3: @AnnCoulter I just love the way Ann Coulter remembers your acts of kindness Donald Trump    GO Trump we love you 


Word is that crying @GlennBeck left the GOP and doesn't have the right to vote in the Republican primary  Dumb as a rock  
Serious doubt in Illinois as to whether or not Cruz can run for President  First of many challenges http://illinoisreview typepad com/illinoisreview/2016/01/carson supporter files to oust ted cruz from illinois gop primary ballot html … 
Just left a great event in Pella  Going to church tomorrow in Muscatine  Iowa  

 @williebosshog such an honor to get your endorsement  You are a fantastic guy It will not be forgotten  Don and Eric say hello 
Heading now to Pella  Iowa  Big crowd Remember  Trump is a big buyer of Pella windows  See you soon 

Just left Sioux Center  Iowa  My speech was very well received  Truly great people Packed house overflow 
A wonderful story on Iowa voters by @arappeport of the @NYTimes http://www nytimes com/politics/first draft/2016/01/22/donald trump challenging political correctness strikes a chord/ _r=0 … 
Failing @GlennBeck lost all credibility  Not only was he fired @ FOX  he would have voted for Clinton over McCain https://www youtube com/watch v=xMKYftaeIJ4 … 
Based on @MegynKelly's conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate  
Heading to Sioux County  Iowa  where the crowd is amazing  Dr  Robert Jeffress will make the introduction  Make America Great Again 
Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big  Because he was born in Canada and was  until recently  a Canadian citizen  many believe he cannot run 
I am in Iowa watching all of these phony T V  ads by the other candidates  All bull  politicians are all talk and no action it won't happen 
 @AnnCoulter has been amazing  We will win and establish strong borders  we will build a WALL and Mexico will pay  We will be great again 

@noamscheiber: Dow down almost 2000 pts since start of year  but still outperforming Wall Street's investment in Jeb  JEB wants Common Core 

I am in Iowa  Will be making two speeches today  Good luck to all of the great folks on the East coast  Enjoy the beauty of the storm 


Is Cruz honest  He is in bed w/ Wall St  & is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi  low interest loans  No legal disclosure & never sold off assets  

Cruz says I supported TARP  which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs  the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose  Puppet 
The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show asked many times  Very few listeners sad 
 @BrentBozell  one of the National Review lightweights  came to my office begging for money like a dog  Why doesn't he say that  
Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him  Jeb mom can't help you with ISIS  the Chinese or with Putin  
Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll what's going on  Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada  

The tax scam Washington Post does among the most inaccurate stories of all  Really dishonest reporting  

Wow New National Zogby Poll just out: TRUMP 45  CRUZ 13  RUBIO 8  Big numbers  
Leaving Nevada now for Iowa  Things are looking good great new polls 



The dying @NRO National Review has totally given up the fight against Barrack Obama  They have been losing for years  I will beat Hillary 


@Lisa_Milicaj: Truth be told  I never heard of The National Review until they tried to declare war on you  No worries  you got my vote 
After spending $89 million  @JebBush is at the bottom of the barrel in polls  He is ashamed to use the name Bush in ads  Low energy guy 
The failing @NRO National Review Magazine has just been informed by the Republican National Committee that they cannot participate in debate 



Highly respected Constitutional law professor Mary Brigid McManamon has just stated  Ted Cruz is not eligible to be President  Big problem 




@realOllieTaylor: Isn't it time we had a president  Let goofy Glen keep Canada Cruz who can't win  The American people have Trump 
Ted Cruz complains about my views on eminent domain  but without it we wouldn't have roads  highways  airports  schools or even pipelines  
The late  great  William F  Buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize  the dying National Review 
Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize  but not how to lead  
National Review is a failing publication that has lost it's way  It's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low  Sad 

Why does @Greta have a fired Bushy like dummy  John Sununu on spewing false info  I will beat Hillary by a lot  she wants no part of Trump  




Happy birthday to my friend  the great @jacknicklaus a totally special guy 
New Day on CNN treats me very badly  @AlisynCamerota is a disaster  Not going to watch anymore  
Low energy candidate @JebBush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign  Millions spent on me  He should go home and relax 
Sad sack @JebBush has just done another ad on me  with special interest money  saying I won't beat Hillary I WILL  But he can't beat me  
So sad that @CNN and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in Oklahoma  Dishonest reporting 
@AmericanAsPie: @glennbeck @SarahPalinUSA Remember when Glenn gave out gifts to ILLEGAL ALIENS at crossing the border  Me too 



Wacko @glennbeck is a sad answer to the @SarahPalinUSA endorsement that Cruz so desperately wanted  Glenn is a failing  crying  lost soul 









@ron_fournier: President Donald Trump (just getting used to it) Wow  very nice 

Judge Jeanine Slams GOP Establishment:http://insider foxnews com/2016/01/18/judge jeanine slams haley gop establishment start supporting your partys frontrunner … 

“Palin’s brand among evangelicals is as gold as the faucets in Trump tower ” said Ralph Reed  the chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition  
Wow  the highly respected Governor of Iowa just stated that Ted Cruz must be defeated  Big shoker People do not like Ted  

In the just released SC poll I increased my lead by 4 points since last poll by same firm  Up by 14 Cruz dropped 3 http://www thestate com/news/politics government/politics columns blogs/the buzz/article55176940 html … 
Thank you for your strong testimony when welcoming me to Liberty University  yesterday @JerryJrFalwell https://www youtube com/watch v=FVMVkKAHXU4 … 

 @FreeJesseJames Just read your complete statement  You are an amazing guy & I really appreciate your words & support  I will see you soon 

Really disgusting that the failing New York Times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories  
Dope Frank Bruni said I called many people  including Karl Rove  losers true I never called my friend @HowardStern a loser he’s a winner 

Wow  new polls just out have Trump up and Cruz down he is a nervous wreck 
 @TheBrodyFile great job on @AC360  Thank you for the very smart and kind words 

I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem  Doubt 
Ted Cruz is falling in the polls  He is nervous  People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks 





Thank you @IvankaTrump for the kind words  I am very proud of the role model you are for so many  NH & IA radio ad:https://youtu be/bOGD9mvzIi4  
@pbralick: @BenKissel great on @greggutfeld @GregGutfeldShow @JoNosuchinsky too Thank you Ben for your nice comments on debate 
I am self funding my campaign putting up my own money  not controlled  Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N Y  bosses  
Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday  Get tough and smart U S   or we won't have a country anymore 

Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them   but they won't buy from U S   rather Airbus 
In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners  They get $150 billion  7 most wanted and many off watch list  This will create great incentive for others 
Interesting read from Peggy Noonan pic twitter com/jAxIy8xseM 
Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning pic twitter com/rYGX9vazku 
Wow Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions  $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul  & $1M low int  loan from Goldman Sachs  Hypocrite 

Greatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St 
When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him  
Everybody that loves the people of New York  and all they have been thru  should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics 
If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage  why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage  
Ted is the ultimate hypocrite  Says one thing for money  does another for votes http://mobile nytimes com/2015/04/24/us/politics/at new york reception ted cruz is said to strike different tone toward gays html referer= … 

Ted Cruz purposely  and illegally  did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks  They own him 
Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a natural born Canadian  did he borrow unreported loans from C banks  
Oh no  just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan  this one from Citi  Wow  no wonder banks do so well in the U S  Senate  
The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace  Remember  his wife's employer  and his lender  is located there 
Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file  Goldman Sachs owns him  he will do anything they demand  Not much of a reformer 
Ted Cruz said he didn't know that he was a Canadian Citizen  He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers Not believable 
Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago  Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow  I told you so 
More radical Islam attacks today it never ends Strengthen the borders  we must be vigilant and smart  No more being politically correct  
 @FrankLuntz is a total clown  Has zero credibility @FoxNews @megynkelly 
 @oreillyfactor please explain to the very dumb and failing @glennbeck that I supported John McCain big league in 2008  not Obama 
Just got back from Iowa had a great time with amazing people  Will be back soon 
 @GeraldoRivera Thank you Geraldo for your nice words on @oreillyfactor tonight  You are a true champion Thank @ericbolling great guy 
@GeraldoRivera @SenTedCruz got ass kicked by @realDonaldTrump last night He offended every New Yorker & has no answer to Natural Born issue 


Sen  Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush  
Jeb Bush  who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero  just got Graham endorsement  Graham quit at O  


@ameriflames: @realDonaldTrump @CLewandowski_ no one wants a Bush or a Clinton  they want a straight shooter like TRUMP 


Do you think Iran would have acted so tough if they were Russian sailors  Our country was humiliated  

@melindaross123: @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump There isn't anything Donald Trump says that I don't agree with  Go Trump 

United States looks more and more like a paper tiger  Won't be that way if I win 
Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors  Horrible pictures & images  We are weak  I will NOT forget 
Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches  Romney campaign his book etc  Why does @andersoncooper put him on  
Why does @CNN & @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist  Stuart Stevens who lost BIG for Romney on the show  





Sadly  there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility  Dems will sue 
@johnkurkosky: @Carolde @The_Lady_Colors @DRJAMESCABOT @TamiDurling @AceofSpadesHQ THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT AMERICAS FUTURE  VOTE TRUMP 

Iran toys with U S  days before we pay them  ridiculously  billions of dollars  Don't release money  We want our hostages back NOW 
Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton  In a race with her  voter turnout will be the highest in U S  history I get most new voters 
The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring  rambling and non substantive I have heard in a long time  New leadership fast 
Just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me  Not nice  but OK New polls are great  




Such a serious problem for Ted & the GOP  Great doubt  Dems will sue Let's all work together to solve this problem https://www bostonglobe com/opinion/2016/01/11/through ted cruz constitutional looking glass/zvKE6qpF31q2RsvPO9nGoK/story html … 
On my way to Cedar Falls  Iowa  now  Will be great I love the people of Iowa 

The Tonight Show begins in 5 minutes  Enjoy 
 @stuartpstevens horrible advise to Mitt Romney made victory an impossibility  Don't blame Mitt Now Stevens can't get a job 

Fantastic job on @CNN tonight  @kayleighmcenany is a winner @donlemon 
Don't forget to watch The Tonight Show with the wonderful @jimmyfallon at 11:30 P M  You will not be disappointed @NBC 
Face The Nation's interview of me was the highest rated show that they have had in 15 years  Congratulations and WOW @CBSNews @jdickerson 
 @MajorCBS Major Garrett of @CBSNews covers me very inaccurately  Total agenda  bad reporter 
Thank you Michael Harrison @Talkersmagazine for your kind words greatly appreciated 

 @megynkelly recently said that she can’t be wooed by Trump  She is so average in every way  who the hell wants to woo her 

 @RinglingBros is retiring their elephants the circus will never be the same  
Congratulations to @jdickerson of Face the Nation on his highest ratings in 15 years  4 6 million people watched my interview Thank you 

So professional of @ABC news to throw out the failing @UnionLeader newspaper from their debate  Paper won't survive  highly unethical 
Great job on Fox this morning @KatiePavlich  I am sending out for your book immediately  Thank you very much 

Why does @ThisWeekABC w/ @GStephanopoulos allow a hater & racist like @tavissmiley to waste good airtime  @ABC can do much better than him 

Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog  For starters  try getting a new publisher 
UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows  They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH  
This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates  I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed  
If their highly unethical behavior  including begging me for ads  isn’t questionable enough  they have endorsed a candidate who can’t win  
I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate http://www politico com/blogs/on media/2016/01/abc severs debate partnership with union leader 217560 … 
Remember  get TIME magazine I am on the cover  Take it out in 4 years and read it again Just watch    
Heading now for Reno  Nevada  for a big rally  Good poll numberd all over 
In the just out @FoxNews Poll  I easily beat Hillary Clinton and I havn't even focused on her yet  On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Yesterday in Iowa was amazing two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds  They love that I am the only candidate self funding 

I want to thank the people of Iowa for an unbelievable day  The crowds were amazing  Will be back Tuesday 
Will be on Meet the Press with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning  Enjoy 
I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning  Tune in 
I'm protesting the @UnionLeader from having anything to do w/ ABC debate  Their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved 

(1/2) Time Magazine has me on the cover this week  David Von Drehle has written one of the best stories I have ever had  

 @JonahNRO  watched on @seanhannity and appreciate your statements I have been waiting for them for a long time  Thank you  
Thank you  @TheFix Chris Cillizza  It is a true person of character that can change his opinion & do what is right https://www washingtonpost com/news/the fix/wp/2016/01/09/still dont think donald trump can win this chart should convince you/ … 

South Carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun)  I am now off to Iowa for two big rallies packed houses  Love it 
Pat Buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @CNN way to go Pat  way ahead of your time 
Great even in SC tonight Fire Marshall would not let everyone in 5 000 turned away  Thank you for coming 
Will be at venue  in wonderful South Carolina  very soon  Big traffic back up  tremendous crowd Will be wild  



I hope all workers demand that their @Teamsters reps endorse Donald J  Trump  Nobody knows jobs like I do Don’t let them sell you out 
On my way to South Carolina  Big Crowd look forward to it 
Not good news for Jeb Bushhttp://www huffingtonpost com/entry/jeb bush liked republicans_568fba2be4b0c8beacf694f4 … 
Hank Greenberg  formerly of AIG  gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago  He is not happy  a total waste of money 
@rlbenney: @realDonaldTrump You did great and showed courage going to Burlington  No other GOP candidate would do what you did tonight 
@pink_sprnva: @pastormike7 @thehill I agree with you on this  @realDonaldTrump won't be good  He will be great 

@hofmannken: DonaldTrump  wish I could attend one of your rallies  none are close enough  Make America Great Again for my Kids Thank you 
Great time in Burlington  Vermont  Crowd was amazing  

I'm leaving now for Burlington  Vermont  It will be wild 
Joy Behar  who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings  is even worse on @TheView  We love Barbara 
The @TheView @ABC  once great when headed by @BarbaraJWalters  is now in total freefall  Whoopi Goldberg is terrible  Very sad 

Weak & ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response  False advertising 
I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster  Try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it 
 @SenTedCruz Ted free legal advice on how to pre empt the Dems on citizen issue  Go to court now & seek Declaratory Judgment you will win 
Massive crowd in VT tonight  Venue not big enough  Officials say NO to outside event and sound system  Arrive early 
Man shot inside Paris police station  Just announced that terror threat is at highest level  Germany is a total mess big crime  GET SMART 
I will be in beautiful Burlington  Vermont  tonight for a rally  Will be great fun  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago  Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted 
 @Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year  plunging 46%  Very disloyal company  Another win for Trump Boycott  
The failing @UnionLeader newspaper in N H  just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads  How stupid  how desperate 

I will be on @wolfblitzer for a @CNNSitRoom interview today  Please join us 5PM ET  
Huge crowd expected tomorrow night VT Police say first come  first serve  Arrive early 
Don’t like @SamuelLJackson’s golf swing  Not athletic  I’ve won many club championships  Play him for charity 
I don’t cheat at golf but @SamuelLJackson cheats—with his game he has no choice—and stop doing commercials 

Germany is going through massive attacks to its people by the migrants allowed to enter the country  New Years Eve was a disaster  THINK 
@becker_berta: @longtalltexan20 Trump single handedly did what no other politician ever dared to do  attacked the media for all their lies 
@ArkaysDesign: @slone @realDonaldTrump Have to get people of all ages out to vote for Donald Trump 
@CompresPhyllis: @seanhannity @FoxNews I am so glad u are for Trump your program is my favorite  The Don is by far the best 
@Kacee50: @realDonaldTrump Women make up the fastest growing market in gun sales  And Hillary wants to take those rights away from women 
@kristopheryan11: @realDonaldTrump mr trump you were excellent on @seanhannity tonight Thank you 

@Boazziz:   @DanScavino Somewhere in that crowd am I  The Gymnasium was electric  the crowd unstoppable & @realDonaldTrump Kingly  
@RubinsteinNel: @realDonaldTrump @pearl_brendan @dphilbs If Trump doesn't win  we may not be able to recuperate America  
@trumpy17: @realDonaldTrump gave an AWESOME speech in Claremont tonight 


@longtalltexan20 @realDonaldTrump I love it when TRUMP calls out MSM for what they really are Cams starting to show crowds at rallies 
@Lucky5713 @NewDay What's wrong with showing Morocco  Nothing It illustrates a Point Duh Love the video 
I don’t know @SamuelLJackson  to best of my knowledge haven't played golf w/him & think he does too many TV commercials—boring  Not a fan  
Wow @UnionLeader circulation in NH has dropped from 75 000 to around 10—bad management  No wonder they begged me for ads  
@lilredfrmkokomo: @realDonaldTrump My Facebook Groups are all voting TRUMP /4000 people Great 
@marybnall01: @realDonaldTrump watched lowell mass speech  Awesome  Great crowd  Make America Great Again 

@iLoveiDevices: @EdwinRo47796972 @happyjack225 @FoxNews @krauthammer Minimizing dependency on China is crucial Only Trump talks about that 
@SalRiccobono: @realDonaldTrump @troyconway Donald get big business back and# MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN FOR 2016 

@Mark98z: @realDonaldTrump Mr  TRUMP this was your best  most energized one to date  ( and i have watched most of them)    WELL DONE 
@samuelghaddad: Wow Let's hear it for the Factor  Let the truth be known  More are beginning to realize @realDonaldTrump is the real deal 
@thecybermenace: @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump hit one out of the ballpark in Lowell  MA tonight 

The rally in Lowell  Massachusetts  was amazing  10 000 people going wild  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Woody Johnson  owner of the NYJets  is @JebBush’s finance chairman  If Woody would’ve been w/me  he would’ve been in the playoffs  at least 
I look forward to being in Lowell  Massachusetts  today  I hear a very big crowd is expected we will have lots of fun 
@RhettRiley1234: Trump only wins with our votes  we must grow Trump nation and do our part  vote  This is our time  

By the way  Hillary & the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the Al Shabaab terror video http://therightscoop com/media gleefully reporting al shabab video with trump ignores hillary and black lives matter are in it too/ … 
The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her  Just watch  
Iran  with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama  has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia & their oil  THEY JUST FOUND IT 
@barbaraslavin1: @RuthMarcus @washingtonpost bashing distinguished women journalists won't win you votes She is 3rd rate  a total dummy 
@TINAHILLSTROM1: @FoxNews @KatrinaPierson I love @piersmorgan & @realDonaldTrump REAL MEN w/ an opinion Exciting interesting controversial 
 @RuthMarcus of the @washingtonpost was terrible today on Face The Nation No focus  poor level of concentration but correct on Hillary lying 
 @chucktodd said today on @meetthepress that attacking Bill to get to Hillary has never worked before  Wrong attacked him in '08 & won 
Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton  in 2008  worked long and hard for Hillary  She LOST Now Bill is at it again  Just watch  

Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe  If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm 
Al Shabbab  not ISIS  just made a video on me they all will as front runner & if I speak out against them  which I must  Hillary lied 
Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D T  video  The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate  
Just returned from Mississippi a great evening  




Just arrived in Mississippi for the rally  Word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive  Will be an amazing evening 

Remember  I am self funding my campaign  the only one in either party  I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests only the U S A  
When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates  beware the candidates are mere puppets $$$$ 
I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women 
Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president  Jeb Bush is a low energy individual  but Hillary is not much better 
Hillary Clinton said that it is O K  to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL  but not O K  to do so in the U S  We must be vigilant 
 @JebBush is a low energy stiff who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls  Has no chance 
 @JebBush is a sad case  A total embarrassment to both himself and his family  he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads 



The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is  by far  me  It will be the largest voter turnout ever she will be swamped 

I will be going to Mississippi tomorrow night hear the crowds are going to be massive Look forward to it  
@CASuperrunner: @georgehenryw Huckabee is a good man   but he needs to get behind @realDonaldTrump I agree 
@MEMEoryHead: I'm one of your biggest fans Mr Trump and I can't wait for you to Make America Great ifAgain Never forget you have support 
@JodiL792: We are Standing with you Spreading the Word   Trump for President 2016 I wake & sleep praying for you & the USA Israel2 
@marie7777777777: @realDonaldTrump we love u to Trump Family  God bless you  
Well  the year has officially begun  I have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around 
@sprinklermanus: @CNN @realDonaldTrump they're spending millions but you're still going to win go Donald Trump 
@jallenaip: Hillary said she was in a Fog of War as explanation for the lies about Benghazi  No fog allowed in WH  Vote Trump POTUS 



I will be on @FoxNews live  with members of my family  at 11:50 P M  We will ring in the New Year together MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
I would like to wish everyone A HAPPY AND HEALTHY NEW YEAR  WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO  FINALLY  MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND GREAT AGAIN 
Do you believe that The State Department  on NEW YEAR'S EVE  just released more of Hillary's e mails  They just want it all to end  BAD 


I would feel sorry for @JebBush and how badly he is doing with his campaign other than for the fact he took millions of $'s of hit ads on me 


@deggow: Just heard a 25 year old man say I would rather work for Donald Trump than Bernie Sanders it's time for me to leave this party  


@SenSanders: I have a message for Donald Trump: No  we’re not going to hate Latinos  we’re not going to hate Muslims  I fully agree 


People ask  why do you tweet and re tweet to millions about @JebBush when he is so low in the polls  Because of his big $ hit ads on me 
@ddpick18: @realDonaldTrump @JebBush @hughhewitt I get pissed off every time I see his ads on Fox  Waste of money Go Trump Many do 
@nikkisue69: @realDonaldTrump @JebBush @hughhewitt Jeb is such a lightweight 
@Luciano031982: @realDonaldTrump Veterans Love Trump But I love the VETS even more 

 @JebBush has spent $63 000 000 and is at the bottom of the polls  I have spent almost nothing and am at the top  WIN @hughhewitt 

A GREAT day in South Carolina  Record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm  This is now a movement to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
I predict that dying @UnionLeader newspaper  which has been run into the ground by publisher Stinky Joe McQuaid  will be dead in 2 years 


I'm going to be live with @ericbolling and @kimguilfoyle to ring in the New Year 2016  Everybody should tune in to @foxnews tomorrow night 


I never thought I'd be saying this but I've really enjoyed @RichLowry on television lately  and he was terrific hosting @seanhannity 
Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) is desperately trying to sell the @UnionLeader  It's a loser  and my comments haven't helped him much  
The dying @UnionLeader newspaper in NH is in turmoil over my comments about them like a bully that got knocked out 

@bfb123456: @trumpiowa @PlaysTrumpCard @realDonaldTrump WOW FANTASTIC   WHO KNEW AMERICANS WERE SO SMART  GREAT TO KNOW WE'RE so smart 
@hammetjohn: DonaldTrump How do u do it Donald  No one could keep up with u at your pace  Shows how hard u will work for us as President 
@videosigninc: @realDonaldTrump Keep the momentum going Mr  Trump  All the best to you for the New Year  Make America Great Again Thanks 

Iowa was fantastic last night  amazing crowd and people  I'm now in Florida  getting ready to go to South Carolina  Big crowd  very exciting 
 @CharlesHurt You were great on @seanhannity last night  Thanks for the nice words  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 

Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader wanted ads  lunches  donations  speeches from me  and tweets very unethical  
The great people of New Hampshire  who I love  are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper  
Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate 




So  I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place  Jeb Bush has spent $59 million & done  Run country my way 
My campaign for president is $35 000 000 under budget  I have spent very little (and am in 1st place) Now I will spend big in Iowa/N H /S C  

I will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow at 7:00 A M  Talking about the state of the race for president  and more  Enjoy 
@BillAtlantaGA: @realDonaldTrump @russgrand @JebBush agreed  You destroyed him with only $250k 43% 
@LandmanMarius: @realDonaldTrump @russgrand @JebBush Word on street is that @JebBush mother is voting @realDonaldTrump So cute 
 @jessebwatters is terrific at hosting on @FoxNews he really gets it 
@russgrand: @JebBush We had your brother and Father who were a disaster in office  do us a favor and drop out in favor of @realDonaldTrump 
Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008  He was terrible  failed badly  and was called a racist 

@LeeMiracle3: @FoxNews @CharlesHurt @realDonaldTrump Trump listening to voters  unlike GOP 

@IJNIPGM: No casualties  Just victory  victory  and more victory as you proclaim the truth that is in your heart  We love God and USA 






Strange  but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes  while he will double & triple them  a disaster 
Wages in are country are too low  good jobs are too few  and people have lost faith in our leaders We need smart and strong leadership now 
Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone  shipped to other countries  We now are part time  sad I WILL FIX 
The middle class has worked so hard  are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of and no effective raise in years  BAD 
If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband  with his terrible record of women abuse  while playing the women's card on me  she's wrong 
@BornToBeGOP: @realDonaldTrump We need a real President to get things done  and that's why we want you Thank you  
Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party  FAST 
Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late  Stupid RNC 

@isabellegirlxo: @realDonaldTrump @JebBush @ananavarro @secupp @CNN Ana is an illegal who needs to be deported No  she's just incompetent 
 @BernieSanders who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e mail crime  said that I feel wages in America are too high  Lie 
@DavidSadler2525: @realDonaldTrump What's going on in VA  What's the GOP doing  They will lose the state because of the RNC 
Why are @JebBush flunkies @ananavarro and @secupp  two of the dumbest people in politics  always on the @CNN panels  and yet Poll:Trump 39 
The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory  The Dems LOVE IT Be smart and win for a change 
R P Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row  Will now not allow desperately needed new voters  Suicidal mistake  RNC MUST ACT NOW 
It begins  Republican Party of Virginia  controlled by the RNC  is working hard to disallow independent  unaffiliated and new voters  BAD 
@LegacyRealtorsJ: You will come out tops Mr Trump  You are sincere  genuine  hard working  honest and willl DO WHAT YOU PROMISE THE PEOPLE 
@JimVitari: @realDonaldTrump @CAC8438 we need the change Trump is going to make  not the change Obama did by ruining the country 
@CAC8438: He supports amnesty and now they are so desperate that Trey Gowdy is going to campaign with him  
@mitchellvii: My prediction on the Trey Gowdy endorsement of Rubio is that it will do nothing for Rubio and finish Gowdy  
@mitchellvii: Face it  Trey Gowdy failed miserably on Benghazi  He allowed it to drag out and in the end  let Hillary get away with murder  

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00  Will be talking about Hillary and far more interesting subjects  Enjoy 
I will do far more for women than Hillary  and I will keep our country safe  something which she will not be able to do no strength/stamina 

Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM  so inappropriate 
@greta: If the insurance companies are making lots of money and the # of uninsured is still large Obamacare is a failure since so expensive 
A new terror warning was issued for European cties  At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart  Weak leaders 

Criminal deportations in the U S  are the lowest number in many years  We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country  MUST CHANGE 
The Phoenix V A   it has just been reported  is in worse shape than ever before  The wait is horrendous  and people are dying  I will fix it 
The same people that said I wouldn't run  or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%)  now say I won't beat Hillary  
 @chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting   and to think he was going off the air until I came along no ratings  I will beat Hillary 


@JodiL792: You know what's making my Christmas Great  Family/food/friends&YOU I HAVE MY TRUMP SHIRT ON W/HOPE IN MY HEART for America 
@Jacobsac2015: @FoxNews Thank you for your tweet today on Christmas  Can't wait to see you as President  Mr  Trump  You are awesome  

When will the Democrats  and Hillary in particular  say we must build a wall  a great wall  and Mexico is going to pay for it  Never 
Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V A  That will stop  I will fix this quickly 
Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE  He's spent $59 million and is at 3%  
We have many problems in our house (country )  and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now  because of me  starting to deport people who are here illegally  Politics 
 @deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews She gets what is going on in politics  and sees it very clearly  Have her on more 
Merry Christmas to all  Have a great day and have a really amazing year  Together  we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN It will be done 
 @danielhalper Great job on @CNN today  Very wise indeed 
 @HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video  Bad reporting  Perhaps @NBC will do better next year but doubt it 
@YesMrGilbert: @NBCNightlyNews @HallieJackson should have talked to Megyn Kelly about this story True  a total distortion of the facts 
I am now in Palm Beach  Florida  and will be going to church tonight  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
 @meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39%  21points higher than Cruz  Be honest Chuck 
Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll  CNN even better 
Wow  because of the pressure put on by me  ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS  It's about time 
Next year will be an interesting one  I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton  a totally flawed candidate  and beating her soundly 
Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias  Think about Bill 
Wow  even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll  Jeb is at 3%  I'm at 39%  Stop throwing your money down the drain 
In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me  Jeb is speaking to me during the debate  but doesn't allow my answer  which destroys him SO SAD 
Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign  I spent almost nothing  He's bottom (and gone)  I'm top (by a lot)  That's what U S  needs 
@classyexplorer: @gatewaypundit Jim you fail to mention in your CNN POLL that in the GOP RACE   Trump is leading Cruz 39 to 18   Big Detail 

@ihatematt: @realDonaldTrump why is Hillary even allowed to run    She's a criminal  
@ihatematt: @realDonaldTrump why is Hillary even allowed to run    She's a criminal  Good question 
Hillary said I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign  I deplore the death and destruction she caused stupidity 

Hillary  when you complain about a penchant for sexism  who are you referring to  I have great respect for women  BE CAREFUL 
It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories  21 pt  Lead 
Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime  He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased  Still thinks Romney won  Unfair coverage of Trump 
 @FoxNews treats me so badly  Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll  All negative 


The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic  Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card  


Big news just out NEW @CNN POLL TRUMP 39 and leads in every major category  Likeability way up  CRUZ 18 CARSON 10 RUBIO 10 
We need a PRESIDENT with strength  stamina  heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again 
It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong  Sad 
When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama  it meant got beaten badly  The media knows this  Often used word in politics 

Wow  new Reuters Poll just out  Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN TRUMP 37 CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge 



Jeb's big ad buy against me  paid for by lobbyists  shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements  He is really pathetic 
Watching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television  Boring and biased 

@schoremis1: @JebBush The Donald should've been named Man of the Year  He dominates the polls  news  talk shows & social media  MAGA 
@qbeacademy: Well I'm at 42% and your at 3%  You know Jeb you started over here you keep on moving further and further off stage  Classic 
 @JebBush's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible fumbled around  incoherent  
Why doesn't @JebBush  in his ads  show my answer to his statement in the debate  
Will @JebBush  in his phony advertising campaign  show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate  
 @JebBush just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy  Will never work 
Weak and low energy @JebBush  whose campaign is a disaster  is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy  
@_MSFL_: @realDonaldTrump @TrumpUSA16 A GREAT PATRIOT 
@realNevaDie: This suggests that online polls are more reliable so Trump is crushing both parties  @realDonaldTrump 
@philmonaco67: @realDonaldTrump 100% Donald Trump Supporter Go Trump Make AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 

@janienorris22: @realDonaldTrump Got my autographed book yesterday can't wait to read it  You got them scared to death Love it    Great 






@HerschelWalker  thanks for your support it is very much appreciated 
Getting ready to leave for Michigan will be an amazing evening See you there  
Do you think that Hillary Clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about the video of me being used by ISIS  There is no video  
Thanks @AndreaTantaros for all of your kind words and thoughts  Big progress is being made  Keep up the great work 
A suicide bomber has just killed U S  troops in Afghanistan  When will our leaders get tough and smart  We are being led to slaughter 

It's the Democrats' total weakness & incompetence that gave rise to ISIS not a tape of Donald Trump that was an admitted Hillary lie 

Getting ready to go to the great State of Michigan  Big crowd tonight  Make America Great Again 
Just out: TRUMP GOP DEBATE 18 000 000  CLINTON DEMOCRAT DEBATE 6 700 000  And they were on major network vs  cable 
Hillary said with respect to ISIS  we are finally where we need to be  Do we want 4 more years of incompetent leadership  MAGA 
I demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate  There never was a video  
Hillary said at debate ISIS is going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst  She made up story want apology 
Very sad what happened last night at the Miss Universe Pageant  I sold it 6 months ago for a record price  This would never have happened 
@msully65: Tell this knitwit @SpeakerRyan  the ppl want @realDonaldTrump  not him or his choice for President Thts why Trump has 40% 

 @JebBush today said he didn't want to be the front runner  he would rather be where he is now  2%  That is the talk of a loser  can't win 


 @MissUniverse final 3 on now  Great people  great new owner @IMG  WATCH  

It was really strange when Hillary was missing from the podium last night  Not very presidential 
Hillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me  Therefore  Hillary LIED at the debate last night  SAD 
 @JebBush was terrible on Face The Nation today  Being at 2% and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence  A basket case 


Hillary Clinton lied when she said that ISIS is using video of Donald Trump as a recruiting tool  This was fact checked by @FoxNews: FALSE 



@DomineekSmith: @realDonaldTrump is the best Republican presidential candidate of all time  Thank you  


 @jonkarl was totally misled  and he fell for it  that Hillary wants to run against me  She knows that I am her worst nightmare Jon doesn't 


@TomSkeet: @realDonaldTrump @GStephanopoulos haha she's not ready for the Donald 

@GStephanopoulos: As @realDonaldTrump dominates the latest polls  I’ll talk to the GOP frontrunner  Sunday on @ThisWeekABC  
 @GStephanopoulos stupidly believes that Hillary wants to run against me because she said so  She says that so people believe it opposite 



President Obama spends so much time speaking of the so called Carbon footprint  and yet he flies all the way to Hawaii on a massive old 747  
See  Sanders backed Hillary on E mails at the debate  hurting himself  and then she threw him under the bus (but failed)  Disloyal person 





The last thing our country needs is another BUSH Dumb as a rock 
 @JebBush has embarrassed himself & his family with his incompetent campaign for President  He should remain true to himself  

Weak & ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response  False advertising 
I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster  Try using your last name & don’t be ashamed of it 
 @MelindaDC Don’t misrepresent in order to make a point  I was always tough on ISIS as you’ll find out after I get elected  
 @CharlesHurt Thanks for defending me so brilliantly against @MelindaDC Always tough when they falsify  













Hillary Clinton is weak and ineffective no strength  no stamina  
@EndlessMike03: @realDonaldTrump @oreillyfactor OMG awesome What time zone   
@chained111: @realDonaldTrump @oreillyfactor yes sir 
@SteelerDan619: @realDonaldTrump @oreillyfactor Your the man 
@2timeslucky: @realDonaldTrump @oreillyfactor You were amazing 
@BornToBeGOP: @realDonaldTrump @oreillyfactor The only person in politics who shouldn’t have term limits is President Trump Cute 
Jeb Bush had a tough night at the debate  Now he'll probably take some of his special interest money  he is their puppet  and buy ad's  
Thank you for the nice words @ktmcfarland  The debate was interesting  and fun  Keep up the great work 
Will be interviewed on the @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 P M  Will be talking about the debate  and more 
Bill O'Reilly calls Trump and campaign brilliant  In first place by 27 points  
 @MarkHalperin works so hard but just doesn't have a natural instinct for politics  Others do  and those are the people you want to follow 
Thank you @davidaxelrod for your nice words this morning on @CNN  It was a good night 
Thank you  so many people have given me credit for winning the debate last night  All polls agree  It was fun and interesting 
@insuradude: The fix is in Donald did his best performance and @MarkHalperin @Morning_Joe has Jeb scoring higher  Jeb looked in pain Joke 




@ConradMBlack: Many thanks Donald  and all good wishes in helping to clean up the American government  Honored to be your friend  C  
@TINAHILLSTROM1: @GovernorPataki @GovernorPataki just called @realDonaldTrump THE PRESIDENT 

@SPerkins50: @CNN @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Donald represents real Americans  Thank you 
@golddstr1: @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump They noticed alright Graham and Patiki are just mad because they dont have a chance  
@JaniBetancoirt: @CNN @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Pataki needs a brain surgeon 
@RobertH25937464: @CNN @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Lindsey still doesn't hear Americans Still at Zero It's like Monty Python  

@MrDeuce25: @CNN @LindseyGrahamSC DonaldTrump Good were glad he doesn't represent what you stand for Lindsey  You are weak and have no clue 
@BillDaley1: @CNN @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Sour grapes graham  Dont blame Trump because you cant interest voters  

Highly respected PUBLIC POLICY POLLING (PPP) just announced that I am number one in IOWA  Thank you 




I won every debate so far according to all debate polls including @DRUDGE_REPORT  @TIME @Slate and more  Too bad dopey @megynkelly lies 
Between Iraq war monger @krauthammer  dummy @KarlRove  deadpan @GeorgezWill  highly overrated @megynkelly  among others  @FoxNews not fair 
I am in Trump International Hotel  Las Vegas  getting ready and waiting for the debate tonight  Look forward hope I get treated fairly 
I wonder if @megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight  No matter how well I do bad 
 @megynkelly is very bad at math  She was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and Cruz in the new Monmouth Poll 41to14  
 @megynkelly  the most overrated anchor at @FoxNews  worked hard to explain away the new Monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead  She said 15 
Why isn't anyone using the @CNN Iowa Poll with me having a big lead  They only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place) Dishonest press 
Isn't it amazing that @CNN paid a fortune for an Iowa Poll  which shows me in first place over Cruz by 13%  33% to 20% then doesn't use it 
Wow  I just had two very good Iowa polls and a phenomenal just out National Poll from @ABC @washingtonpost 38%  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 

@piersmorgan: Donald Trump vs Hillary Clinton would be the greatest presidential battle in history  
@LadyKellLiberty: @AnnCoulter I'm in PA near PBurgh  Dad will register to vote first time for Trump  Mom is changing from D to R 



@oreillyfactor  horrible defense of me against highly overrated @krauthammer  I will bring more people into the party & easily beat Hillary 


Thank you @hardball_chris for your nice words  They are very much appreciated  I fully understand that you really get it  

Can't believe Major League Baseball just rejected @PeteRose_14 for the Hall of Fame  He's paid the price  So ridiculous let him in 



Another great accolade for @TrumpGolf  Highly respected Golf Odyssey awarded @TrumpDoral Blue Monster with best redesign  Thank you 



Why doesn't @FoxNews quote the new Iowa @CNN Poll where I have a 33% to 20% lead over Ted Cruz and all others  Think about it 


People have got to stop working to be so politically correct and focus all of their energy on finding solutions to very complex problems 

@LesgartCPA: @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump Problem is I never watched you until Trump started giving you interviews and ratings on CNN  

@JPMORGAN2016: TRUMP NEEDS HIS OWN POLL A REAL POLL  IN EVERY STATE  THESE POLLS ARE SO RIDICULOUS THE MEDIA WILL ONLY GET WORSE FROM HERE 
@1rdgreenberg: @FoxNews That's why  after your interview  I couldn't watch the panel discussion  which is usually my favorite segment  
@energy43: @schnoepoe @FoxNews Not so much fairness as it is about ratings   Megan Kellys hate nightly of Trump is turn off for FOX 
I was disappointed that Ted Cruz would speak behind my back  get caught  and then deny it  Well  welcome to the wonderful world of politics 
I did interview with Chris Wallace of @FoxNews in order to be fair  He then puts on Rove  Lane and Will  three Trump bashers  to discuss  
@TheProdigy3D: Everyone vote for @realDonaldTrump and no he did not pay me for this endorsement  
@schnoepoe: @foxnews I find myself more and more drawn to CNN for fairness regarding @realDonaldTrump The Fox News Sunday pundits a joke 
@VYlvisaker: @AnnCoulter TRUMP HAS STAMINA  HE IS WORKING HARDER THAN ANY OTHER CANDIDATE  He REALLY loves AMERICA   He deserves to win  
Many think that the Championship Course at Turnberry  home of The Duel In The Sun  will be the worlds best after the renovation  
A very good NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll was just released wherein I went up from last month and am in the lead  Nice 
@BernieSanders: ABC News spent 81 minutes on Donald Trump and only 20 seconds on our campaign  That's because @ABC is smart 
 @danawhite Great job last night very exciting You have come a long way from those difficult early days  I am proud of you  
People that have read it tell me that @KarlRove book is terrible (and boring)  Save your money @FoxNews should can him  no credibility 

@Yoel_NY: @realDonaldTrump @Peggynoonannyc As a democrat I have to say  since Hillary is the front runner  I will choose Trump  
@JPMORGAN2016: @realDonaldTrump @Peggynoonannyc TRUMP IS WINNING BY SO MUCH MORE  IT'S NEAR 60% NATIONALLY  THEY ARE ALL BIASED POLLS 
@rosemarylowe105: @ShahKourosh @SpacemanChris @realDonaldTrump That is why we don't need a politician to be the next president  
@StraightHand: @realDonaldTrump I'd pay to watch that The Donald vs Hillary Get ready 

@mikepetrella17: @Peggynoonannyc I agree with Trump  Record turnouts   There's a lot of potential voters that Trump is tapping into  
Chris Wallace @fox at 10:00 A M  

 @CNN @jaketapper at 9:00 A M  
 @Peggynoonannyc An election between Hillary and myself will be the biggest voter turnout in U S  history  Just like the debates 24 M vs 2M  
 @Peggynoonannyc Interesting article  but I will beat Hillary easily  People that have given up on the system will come out to vote for me 
@Michael2014abc: @Alwaleed_Talal @realDonaldTrump Has your country  Saudi Arabia  taken ANY of the Syrian refugees  If not  why not

Just got back from Iowa  great people 

 @MonicaCrowley you were great with @SeanHannity on @FoxNews tonight  Thank you for your kind words  We will keep Americans safe  




Tom Ridge is a failed 'Bushy' & PA Governor  Him & his friend @KarlRove shouldn't be allowed to do their bias commentary nobody listens 
Tom Ridge should be focused on trying to bring the party together rather than ripping it apart w/ your faulty thought process  I will win 



 @chucktodd is a nice guy   but just hopeless  He knows so little about politics and  in particular  winning I fixed his rating problem  
 @Morning_Joe just went off the rails  I will beat Hillary easily she does not want to run against me  I am tuning them out  waste of time 
 @tedcruz should not make statements behind closed doors to his bosses  he should bring them out into the open more fun that way 
Looks like @tedcruz is getting ready to attack  I am leading by so much he must  I hope so  he will fall like all others  Will be easy 
 @Morning_Joe is so off on Iowa  which I am leading big in new @CNN poll  I will win Iowa  Also  I beat Hillary easily 
Great evening last night in New Hampshire  Got the endorsement from the New England Police Union big territory  great people Thank you

@FoxNews: @FrankLuntz: Time for the Republican establishment to accept the fact that Trump is not only a viable candidate  but lead is real 
@edwards_cristy: @realDonaldTrump I hope that you will be the next POTUS  
Respected Morning Consult poll just out  I lead all Republicans and beat Hillary head to head by a wide margin 45 to 40

Thank you to @Franklin_Graham  I have always appreciated your courage  but now more so than ever 


Establishment flunky @KarlRove is going crazy with the just released CBS poll that has me way ahead  New Fox poll has me beating Hillary  
Dummy @KarlRove continues to make and write false statements  He still thinks Romney won he should get a life 




The United Kingdom is trying hard to disguise their massive Muslim problem  Everybody is wise to what is happening  very sad Be honest

Wow  my poll numbers have just been announced and have gone through the roof 
 @Megynkelly spent a big part of her show talking about other shows spending so much time on me  Really weird  she's being driven crazy 
@jimparkey: @realDonaldTrump @donlemon @CNN great interview Speaking calmly but carrying a heavy stick Thank you 
Weak and totally conflicted people like @TheRickWilson shouldn't be allowed on television unless given an I Q  test  Dumb as a rock @CNN 
@QuinnLisaq: @CNN @donlemon   The people do not care what politician said about Trump   We still support him all the way 
Great interview tonight @donlemon very professionally done  @CNN 


@Ajdx4Sdesq: @CNN @donlemon @realDonaldTrump this is the best interview so far  Honest  well reasoned and without all the name calling  
@michaelUrso2: Mr Trump did you deny Megyn Kelly  What is her issue I used to like her  Can't stand her now  Very little talent @FoxNews 
Thank you @oreillyfactor for your wonderful editorial as to why I should have been @TIME Magazine's Person of the Year  You should run Time 

Why does @CNN bore their audience with people like @secupp  a totally biased loser who doesn't have a clue  I hear she will soon be gone 
 @secupp  who can't believe that her candidate has bombed so badly  is one of the dumber pundits on T V  Hard to watch  zero talent @CNN 
 @donlemon on @CNN at 10:00 P M  

I am interviewed on the @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00  Then at 10:00  I am interviewed by @donlemon on @CNN  Enjoy

 @Mayor_Nutter of Philadelphia  who is doing a terrible job  should be ashamed for using such a disgusting word in referring to me Low life 


I told you @TIME Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite They picked person who is ruining Germany 
@mysteriousLoser: @realDonaldTrump did you hear the mayor nutter of philadelphias comments towards you  Ignorance Yes  he is a crude dope 

@ray_aub: @nytimes @CNN People forget the policies of leaders like @JebBush allowed 9/11 killers to immigrate  drive  & pilot planes 
Hillary Clinton does not have the STRENGTH or STAMINA to be President  We need strong and super smart for our next leader or trouble 
The last person corrupt Hillary Clinton wants to run against is Donald J  Trump  I'll end up beating her in every state  New Fox Poll Trump 
The failing @nytimes does not mention the new @CNN Poll that has me leading Iowa by a massive 13 points I am at 33%  Maggie Haberman  sad 
@USAforDJTRUMP: @realDonaldTrump @CNN Mr  Trump  you need to get some rest  We need you to stay healthy so that you can be our President 
@YitzySchwartz: @CNN anyone who hates on Trump hates on America  We are a proud nation lacking a leader  Choose Trump to bring us 
Great poll numbers just coming out of New Hampshire  BIG lead for Trump according to @CNN 
Wow  what a day  So many foolish people that refuse to acknowledge the tremendous danger and uncertainty of certain people coming into U S  
Our country is facing a major threat from radical Islamic terrorism  We better get very smart  and very tough  FAST  before it is too late 
Despite my great respect for King Abdullah II  I will not be visiting Jordan at this time  This is in response to the false @AP report  
Prior to the end of the year  I will be traveling to Israel  I am very much looking forward to it  

Will be on @ABC News tonight at 6:30  Interviewed by the legendary @BarbaraJWalters Enjoy

I wish the @WSJ Wall Street Journal had reported the just out @CNN Iowa Poll correctly  I lead by a wide margin 13 points  going up big 
Just won IOWA @CNN Poll BIG: Trump 33% Cruz 20% Rubio 11%  but @WSJ reported Cruz momentum but nothing about the fact that I easily won 

@XGNRaging: @realDonaldTrump I hope you become president 

@GeneMcGee6: @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity is so great towards you  Just doesn't like people on his show to bad mouth you  He is great   
@CharlesMarino8: @3DOT DonaldTrump preach it brother First election I've been excited about in many many years  Since Reagan to be exact 


@Truth_or_Rumor: @realArthurSpina @realDonaldTrump Hey Hillary  America will feel much safer once you've failed to get into office  
@back2reason: @realDonaldTrump Can't wait for President Trump to put things in order in US  We desperately need patriot with finally brains 

Just released @CNN Poll gives me a big 13 point lead in Iowa  Change your false story failing @nytimes  Thank you Iowa 



Just put out a very important policy statement on the extraordinary influx of hatred & danger coming into our country  We must be vigilant 

I am especially grateful for the tremendous support I have received from the Evangelicals in the just out Iowa CNN poll  Thank you 
I am greatly honored by the results of the CNN poll in Iowa  In the end  I believe the final results will be even better than that 
 @washingtonpost is going out of its way to tell failing candidates how to beat Donald Trump The Post doesn’t get that I’m good at winning 
@BornToBeGOP @DanScavino Trump will only increase his lead after the terror attacks  America believes Trump will get rid of ISIS 




If @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes  its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag  The @washingtonpost scam is saving it 
The @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon Big tax shelter 
The @washingtonpost  which loses a fortune  is owned by @JeffBezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company  @amazon  
N Y C  has the worst Mayor in the United States  I hate watching what is happening with the dirty streets  the homeless and crime Disgrace 
I spoke with other candidates to a Jewish group  many friends  in D C  I said I'm a negotiator like you Got standing O rated best of day 
Obama said in his speech that Muslims are our sports heroes  What sport is he talking about  and who  Is Obama profiling  
Thank you Graham Ledger of the Daily Ledger @OANN for your really fair coverage and your great interview with Peter Roff of U S  NEWS & W R  

@WiggintonRandy: @realDonaldTrump He will never say it  therefore he will never have a solution 
Well  Obama refused to say (he just can't say it)  that we are at WAR with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS  
Should have gone after the oil years ago (like I have been saying)  
Wish Obama would say ISIS  like almost everyone else  rather than ISIL  
Is that all there is  We need a new President FAST 
@homefreeee: @realDonaldTrump He needs to stop all Visas not look at them 
@JFK4701: @realDonaldTrump he is reading off the TelePrompTer  But that is O K  in this case  

@10inchpolitics: @realDonaldTrump air strikes  Who's air strikes   
@dboiarsky: @realDonaldTrump MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN  DT 
Hope he won't spend too much time ripping apart the 2nd  Amendment 
The podium in the Oval Office looks odd Not good  but the words will be the key  
Hillary won't call out radical Islam She will be soundly defeated  
I will be re tweeting some of your better  most imaginative and hopefully insightful tweets  Make them good (great) Important stuff  
BIG NIGHT ON TWITTER TONIGHT  I WILL BE LIVE TWEETING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH AT 7:50 P M  ( EASTERN)  MUST TALK RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM

@BrianBl43802294 @JohnKasich Trump is not controlled by donors special interests Lobbyists like U Ur a total puppet Trump is working 4 U S  
So  how did I do on Face The Nation  
Watch Face The Nation will be on now 
Hillary just said that she will not use the term radical Islamic but was incapable of saying why  She is afraid of Obama & the e mails 

@JSears68: Poll numbers will go up even more for @realDonaldTrump after Obama's 'address' 
@dr_tweedy: @CNN @JohnKasich Kasick message is as muddled and stagnant as his political career  Lied about Trump crowd  Media he LIED 
I will be interviewed on Face The Nation @CBSNews at 10:30 A M  Should be interesting ENJOY 
Was going to do a phoner this morning with @jaketapper on @CNN but they could not get their phone equipment to hook in  Will do next week  
Wonder if Obama will ever say RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST  

@Pimpburgh2015: @KatyTurNBC @realDonaldTrump just tweeted that you are a third rate reporter  That's only because I'm being nice

A total refutation of the disgraceful David Brooks column in the failing @NYTimes by the @WashingtonPost:https://www washingtonpost com/news/the fix/wp/2015/12/04/the problem with the donald trump pink rug theory/ … 

 @JRubinBlogger one of the dumber bloggers @washingtonpost only writes purposely inaccurate pieces on me  She is in love with Marco Rubio  
The horrible shooting that took place in San Bernardino was an absolute act of terror that many people knew about  Why didn’t they report  
 @marthamaccallum Martha  great interview with my son @EricTrump smart  tough & professional  Thank you @FoxNews 

The virtually incompetent Republican Strategist who has had a failed career  Cheri Jacobus  is incoherent with anger that her puppets died 
 @CNN & @CNNPolitics Please thank Alisyn Camerota  David Chalian and John King for the very professional reporting of the new CNN Poll

How is Chris Christie running the state of NJ  which is deeply troubled  when he is spending all of his time in NH  New Jerseyans not happy 
Wow  the MSM is really going after me  12 000 in Sarasota  a love fest  hardly a mention  Only one negativity they only want negatives 
@charlottepturn: @Morning_Joe THERE WERE NO VIDEO CELL PHONES IS AreUall looking4bonus Near StJoes Hosp Paterson NJ Arab area outside celeb 
@wzpd8z: Mr  Trump  Chuck Todd is a moron  all kinds of youtube videos showing muslims celebrating 911  I would show it on your ads  
@wompol: @realDonaldTrump @CNN we also saw numerous (since scrubbed) videos of celebrations on 9/11 
When will @CNN get some real political talent rather than political commentators like Errol Louis  who doesn't have a clue Others bad also  
@BeckyOmz: @JuvenIle @thehill We could use a new era of greatness America needs to return to its place in the world leading 

@ThisWeekABC: Maria  why do you work with such dummies as Cokie Roberts  @BillKristol  @mattbai  You can do much better @MariaTCardona  

@Dmsrcmc12Bob: @realDonaldTrump They should all get on the Trump train So true 

@Rketeltas: Every time Trump is gracious enough to do a MSM interview he gets ambushed with nonsensical questions  why is that  


Great job @MariaTCardona on @ThisWeekABC  You made kooky Cokie Roberts and @BillKristol look even dumber than they are  You will be right 

After my meeting with the pastors  it's off to Georgia for a big rally many thousands of great people will be there  a beautiful movement 
Will be meeting on Monday at Trump Tower with a large group of African American Pastors  Many I know wonderful people Not a press event  
Just watched Cookie Roberts on @ABC  Her predictions have been so wrong for so long that she has lost all credibility  Just another sad case 



@Allibiis: @realDonaldTrump @ArtPar17 @CNN story is bogus  Donald Trump has the most diverse group of voters/supporters in the GOP field  
 @CNN has to do better reporting if it wants to keep up with the crowd So totally one sided and biased against me that it is becoming boring 
@Pablo44x: @CNN @realDonaldTrump Another hit piece by CNN  What  We're not biased 
I will be on @meetthepress in an interview with @chucktodd on Sunday morning  So much to talk about 
@ArtPar17: @CNN Your story is a total fraud I agree 
@JacoH: @CNN @realDonaldTrump I can't believe how low CNN can go  Obviously a bunch of Killary fans  @CNN only says negative bad reporters 
The Sarasota  Florida  rally today was amazing  12 000 people chanting their love for our country  It's going to happen  this is a MOVEMENT 
 @CNN Kayleigh McEnany was great on you network today  You should have her on more often Thank you Kayleigh for your nice words

I will be going to Sarasota  Florida  today for a big rally with amazing people I have one goal on mind: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 



@MargaretCrowth1: @realDonaldTrump Incompetence now the norm  NYTimes is an example  Need competent leader as role model  Trump2016 
@reallyo1: @realDonaldTrump @MarkSimoneNY Don't let the jackals in the media trip u up  Their getting desperate 
@MargaretCrowth1: @realDonaldTrump So like the media to make something out of nothing  Don't let them sidetrack from the message  
@DeusVultGeorgia: @MingBlueTeaCup @RickCanton @_Holly_Renee @realDonaldTrump should the reporter's dishonesty be shielded from ridicule  
@VaughnVhalen: Donald Trump Rises to 38% Nationally; Ted Cruz Edges into 2nd at 12% 
@MarkSimoneNY: Great twitter quote about Donald Trump: Never apologize for fake controversies whipped up by the perpetually offended media 
@Rketeltas: @realDonaldTrump If you combine the business models for both Macy's & the NY Times  both are on a rapid decline  such a pity  
@pthebnyc: @realDonaldTrump @Sari_Swensen @nytimes no need to explain  Sir  We've got your back  Thanks 
@BeezakaMrB: @realDonaldTrump Shopping @Macys is NO LONGER a family CHRISTMAS TIME tradition in my house  Great  a very disloyal chain 
The failing @nytimes should focus on fair and balanced reporting rather than constant hit jobs on me  Yesterday 3 boring articles  today2 
I do not know the reporter for the @nytimes  or what he looks like  I was showing a person groveling to take back a statement made long ago 

@PrisonPlanet:  @realDonaldTrump gets it  Never apologize for fake controversies whipped up by the perpetually offended media  

Happy Thanksgiving to all  Have a great day and look forward to the future  We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
The numbers at the @nytimes are so dismal  especially advertising revenue  that big help will be needed fast  A once great institution SAD 
So  since the people at the @nytimes have made all bad decisions over the last decade  why do people care what they write  Incompetent 
The dopes at the @nytimes bought the Boston Globe for $1 3 billion and sold it for $1 00  Their great old headquarters gave it away So dumb 
The @nytimes is so poorly run and managed that other family members are looking to take over control  With unfunded liabilities big trouble 
@RioSunny3: @realDonaldTrump @WKRG I lived in New Jersey at that time and witnessed all that as well  
The failing @nytimes should be focused on good reporting and the papers financial survival and not with constant hits on Donald Trump 
@Keeping__Real: So good to see the @realDonaldTrump family out with him on the campaign trail It really shows the family man that he is 





@KarlRove just totally bombed on @Morning_Joe  @FoxNews has him on even though he has lost all credibility a loser Fox should dump Rove  
@FranMFarber: @Morning_Joe @FoxNews @morningmika did not say very nice things about you this morning on her show  Typical liberal True

@patty_laughlin: DonaldTrump @karl @Morning_Joe @FoxNews Never thought much of Carl   Make America Great Again Trump for President 2016 
@DonnySmith557: @karl @Morning_Joe @FoxNews Karl is a total joke If he didn't have the Bush family and Fox he wouldn't have anything 
South Carolina was so great last night  Will be back soon 
Why would @greta use @KarlRove as an election analyst when he has made so many mistakes  He still thinks Romney won  An establishment dope 
@idawhannadoyou: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Love it  Wish I could get @OANN I hear good things about them such as objective unbiased reporting  



A wonderful evening in South Carolina big crowd  amazing energy 
@PatSheldon10913: @realDonaldTrump had a great time in Myrtle Beach tonight  


What is Frank VanderSloot getting for agreeing to back Marco Rubio  Last victim was Mitt Romney see how that turned out  
 @BradPaisley came up to see me  A really nice and talented guy pic twitter com/duJ7vXLGZw 
@cecki: Leave our candidate @realDonaldTrump alone Do not embarrass yourselves further

Will be doing @seanhannity at 10 PM on @FoxNews  As always with Sean  will be interesting 
Heading to Myrtle Beach  South Carolina  Really big crowd—so much to talk about 
Republicans must stop relying on losers like @KarlRove if they want to start winning presidential elections  Be tough and get smart 
@Good2bqueen67:  @realDonaldTrump @Sandikay60 I enjoyed the speech so much tonight  you were on point Sir Thanks  

@Port3Star: @JDiamond1 @CNNPolitics You know he has great vision  The very best  Many people have told him so  Thousands of people 
@JeffPage5: @realDonaldTrump @WSJ @GOP they're finally gettin the message  we're fed up & we're not going establishment  

@beingmesuzieeJ: @realDonaldTrump    You ROCKED IT AGAIN IN OHIO Come to Nebraska   Please Trump 2016 Thanks and I will 
Just left Columbus rally of 14 000 people a far bigger crowd than even I expected Unbelievable evening  incredible spirit in the arena 

@DonnySmith557: @realDonaldTrump Everything Mr  Trump touches turns to gold  what a great negotiator Thanks  
Heading for Ohio really big crowd of amazing people Much to talk about 

 @WSJ reports that @GOP getting ready to treat me unfairly—big spending planned against me  That wasn’t the deal 



Going to Columbus  Ohio today for a tremendous rally of thousands  The silent majority is no longer silent 
 @AP has one of the worst reporters in the business @JeffHorwitz wouldn’t know the truth if it hit him in the face  
 @AP continues to do extremely dishonest reporting  Always looking for a hit to bring them back into relevancy—ain’t working 
 @MatthewJDowd thank you for the nice comments recently  especially on @BarbaraJWalters  My family & I greatly appreciate your kind words  
Hillary Clinton is weak on illegal immigration  among many other things  She is strong on corruption corruption is what she's best at 

@ktd101551: @CNNPolitics Trump gave a great speech in Ala  What's more important a protester  I wouldn't give these folks 1 sec of attn 
@jrpantiques: @realDonaldTrump @TheFix @pbump THE SCRIPT FOR A GREAT WORLD CHANGING LEADER TO ARISE HAS BEEN WRITTEN & IT WAS FOR MR  TRUMP 
@bloggerjulie: @FoxNews The reporter is the one who mentioned the national database FIRST and not DonaldTrump  Y not report HONEST NEWS  
@MJP1370: @realDonaldTrump @TheFix @pbump We need Trump now Obama isn't protecting Americans 

@drewtheg: Trump is the epitome of integrity  good spirit  forthright honesty    you pull no punches and call a spade a spade  diggin it 


@heiressarts: @realDonaldTrump By going after you  Jindal also lost the LA governor race Politicians Beware  

We better get tough with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS  and get tough now  or the life and safety of our wonderful country will be in jeopardy 
13 Syrian refugees were caught trying to get into the U S  through the Southern Border  How many made it  WE NEED THE WALL 
Great poll numbers all over and beating Hillary Clinton one on one  Thank you 
Big new @ABC Poll to be announced at 9:00 A M  on This Week with @GStephanopoulos  I will be interviewed on show 
 @GStephanopoulos just announced that I am leading BIG in the new @ABC Poll which will be shown on This Week at 9:00 A M  I will be on show 
Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00 A M  
I find that @Reuters is a far more professional operation than @AP  
 ccolvinj @AP is one of the truly bad reporters working for an organization that has totally lost its way  Stories are fictional garbage  










@GStephanopoulos: I’ll talk to Donald Trump about his comments on Syrian refugees  and much more  Sunday on @ThisWeekABC  

 @heytana  great job we are all proud of you 


It's too bad so few people showed up to @bobvanderplaats Family Leader dinner  Next year I'll try & be there and they'll have a huge crowd 
Thank you John Nolte for wonderful analysis & reporting  
Rumor has it Pataki  Kasich  & Senator Lindsey Graham are dropping out of the race very soon  Hope it's not true  they're so easy to beat 
So nice when media properly polices media  Thank you @BreitbartNews http://www breitbart com/big journalism/2015/11/21/muslim registry rope me hillary haberman lies about trump on nyt front page/ … 
A woman who got fired after two days of working with Scott Walker a wacko now trying to raise funds to fight me  
Heading to Birmingham  Alabama  and a massive crowd of incredible people 12 noon will be wild  
To show you how politicians act  Bobby Jindal spent $1 000 to register in New Hampshire & dropped out the next day  Such a waste 
We're stuck with the worst mayor in the United States  Too bad  but New York City will survive 
People are really liking my new book  Crippled America  Check it out 
@tas0727: @realDonaldTrump Make America Great again vote Donald Trump 
@jaazee1: @CNN anchor's shocked that DonaldTrump's comments resonate with GOP base will go apoplectic that he does with democrats too  
@STATinc2015: @BarbaraJWalters @ABC @MELANIATRUMP @IvankaTrump saw the interview tonight  Thought it was great  Can't wait till November

@2timeslucky: No one can take @realDonaldTrump down because it is the WILL of the people for him to win 
@JamesPWilson1: @realDonaldTrump When you become president  we will avenge all of the innocents who isis killed 
@mia_liner: @GSRPygmies @realDonaldTrump Trump supporters are a very loyal breed We see the truth  only Trump can fix this mess we are in 
Looking forward to watching the legendary @BarbaraJWalters interview my family (and me) tonight on @ABC at 10:00  Many things to talk about 
@smith_jere: @realDonaldTrump You are amazing Mr  Trump Thank you So nice  

 @washingtonpost @BretBaier Please thank Charles Lane for his new found confidence  He has made a very good bet 
@The2ndguardsUS: @realDonaldTrump ROLL TIDE 
@samsellars: @realDonaldTrump North Carolina  Come on down  Will be there very soon 
@meganweaver321: @realDonaldTrump Alabama loves you Great 

@GeraldSoelz: Awesome news  Keep your focus on the issues  You just might get more blue collar Democrats to vote for you than Reagan  
 @Gracematters Thank you  a very wise bet Best wishes  
Just got back from South Carolina  Going to Alabama tomorrow 





I didn't suggest a database a reporter did  We must defeat Islamic terrorism & have surveillance  including a watch list  to protect America 

My family has the honor of being interviewed for a full hour by the legendary @BarbaraJWalters tonight @ABC 10pmE pic twitter com/cm4fv1Ye9L 
 @mkhammer  a Fox contributor  isn't smart enough to know what is going on at the border  @TheJuanWilliams made the point far better 
Going to South Carolina now  great place  SRO crowd  Iowa was amazing yesterday 
The media must denigrate ISIS at all levels or youth will continue to be drawn to it  These are low level degenerates  NOT masterminds 
The media must immediately stop calling ISIS leaders MASTERMINDS  Call them instead thugs and losers  Young people must not go into ISIS 


John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed  bringing down the world and ruining people's lives  A total failure 
Once John Kasich announced he was running for president  and opened his mouth  people realized he was a complete & total dud 
John Kasich fell right into President Obama’s trap on ObamaCare  and the people of Ohio are suffering for it  Shame 
Doesn’t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else he’s almost last  
John Kasich ad guy wanted to work for me  but his proposal was a rip off – I said NO Now ripping Kasich  
I loved beating John Kasich in the debates  but it was easy—he came in dead last 
Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down  People from NH are smart 
Watch Kasich squirm if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun 
I want to do negative ads on John Kasich  but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don’t want to waste my money  
John Kasich  despite being Governor of Ohio  is losing to me in the Ohio polls  Pathetic 
John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image  not negative ads on me  
Governor Kasich  whose failed campaign & debating skills have brought him way down in the polls  is going to spend $2 5 million against me  
The legendary Barbara Walters interviews Melania Trump and me on a special this Friday night at 10:00 on ABC  Don't miss it 

Just the beginning & it is going to get worse  Rates & deductibles are so high nobody is going to be able to use it http://www forbes com/sites/scottgottlieb/2015/11/19/uniteds warning shows how medicaid is taking over obamacare/ … 


Thank you (Chris) @TheFix  I have great respect for professionals that are willing to report so honestly & fairly https://www washingtonpost com/news/the fix/wp/2015/11/19/yes donald trump could absolutely be the republican nominee in 2016/ … 


The POLICE in Paris did a fantastic job  Very brave not easy 

Everyone is now saying how right I was with illegal immigration & the wall  After Paris  they’re all on the bandwagon  

I skipped a speech given years ago at Mar a Lago by dopey @GeorgeWill because he’s BORING—he never forgot 
Dopey @GeorgeWill  a big proponent of the Iraq War and other catastrophes  doesn’t like me very much  That means I win 
Broken down political pundit @GeorgeWill  who is wrong almost all of the time  should be thrown off @FoxNews  Boring and totally biased 
Eight Syrians were just caught on the southern border trying to get into the U S  ISIS maybe  I told you so  WE NEED A BIG & BEAUTIFUL WALL 
Ben Carson is being severely criticized for being incapable of understanding foreign policy be one of his top consultants  Not good

@Ashevillelaura: @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews Obama has no credibility on terrorist threats & ISIS  Trump best to protect us 
I will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10:00 on @FoxNews   Much  much  much to talk about 

 @AP is doing very badly  I can say from experience their reporting is terrible & highly inaccurate  Sadly  they are now irrelevant 
One of the saddest things in journalism is what happened to the formerly great @AP  They have lost their way and are no longer credible  


Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country  Who knows who they are some could be ISIS  Is our president insane  
I  along with almost everyone else  have so little confidence in President Obama  He has a horrible attitude a man who is resigned to defeat 
So many great polls like Reuters big leads everywhere  New Hampshire really special We will win big and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 

Just received a copy of @SarahPalinUSA new book a great read Sarah is a terrific person  


Just landing in Knoxville  Tennessee Massive crowd expected Will all have a great time  despite serious subject matter  



Republicans must stop listening to dopes like @KarlRove who still insists Mitt Romney won the last election  Think big & think strong 
Wow  @Macys shares are down more than 40% this year  I never knew my ties & shirts not being sold there would have such a big impact 
Interesting article from highly respected Wayne Allyn Roothttp://www theblaze com/contributions/islamic state terrorist attack proves donald trump was right about border and immigration/ … 
Remember  I was the one who said attack the oil (ISIS source of wealth) a long time ago  Everyone scoffed  now they're attacking the oil  
@SarahPalinUSA: From St  Patrick's Cathedral  NYC: blessings  prayers and heartfelt concern for those in Paris  
@StreetR77: @JohnLegere @TMobile didn't know he was CEO of tmobile  I have T Mobile  it's pathetic  dropped calls  no service  
Tom Brady just did it again  He is not only a great guy  he is  without question  the BEST quarterback 
President Obama just told President Putin how important the Russian air strikes against ISIS have been  I TOLD YOU SO 
 @JohnLegere @TMobile John  focus on running your company  I think the service is terrible Try hiring some good managers  
@peg4cats: @TerryLambert201 @realDonaldTrump you are so right  I only trust Trump to be tough on immigration 
@760_831: @DanSaltsman @realDonaldTrump @MichaelCohen212 @IvankaTrump I have faith he will win and save America 
@760_831: @DanSaltsman @realDonaldTrump @MichaelCohen212 @IvankaTrump i have faith he will win and save America 

@syoka68: Reading the comments of the leftists on here makes me nauseated  We SO NEED YOU  MR  TRUMP Make America Great Again 
@davenorthYV: Does anybody ever realize that HillaryClinton doesn't make eye contact with anyone  even the camera  That's a sign of lying 

@Hturne: @VanityFair You're spot on He tries 2b an intellectual elitist The truth: he has a low IQ  no imagination  no creativity 
Glad to see that @RondaRousey lost her championship fight last night  Was soundly beaten not a nice person 
I have watched sloppy Graydon Carter fail and close Spy Magazine and now am watching him fail at @VanityFair Magazine  He is a total loser 
 @VanityFair Magazine is doing really poorly  It has gotten worse and worse over the years  and has lost almost all of it's former allure 


@thewatcher23579: One of Paris terrorist came as Syrian refugee  Donald Trump is right again  BOMB THEIR OIL TAKE AWAY THEIR FUNDING 
We need strong  tough and brilliant leadership now more than ever MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
I had a great time in Texas yesterday  A tremendous crowd of wonderful and enthusiastic people  Will be back soon 

When will President Obama issue the words RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM  He can't say it  and unless he will  the problem will not be solved 
@mnrosrnr: @realDonaldTrump the best book I've read in years  Trump is right on every issue and has the best ideas  a true economic genius 


I think everyone will like my new and very successful book  Crippled America  Go get it and let me know what you think 
Wow  Bernie Sanders just admitted that the real unemployment rate is 10% (it is actually over 20%) and for African American youth 51%  
Hillary and Sanders are not doing well  but what is the failed former Mayor of Baltimore doing on that stage  O'Malley is a clown  
Why won't President Obama use the term Islamic Terrorism  Isn't it now  after all of this time and so much death  about time 

@redletter99: @realDonaldTrump I absolutely love this  can't wait till u debate Clinton 
@TomRichey: Enough of these party debates  What I wanna see is a @SenSanders vs @realDonaldTrump one on one debate That would be easy 




@Gman0623: @realDonaldTrump @HaloOneForTrump @FoxNews @CNN @GOP I love you Trump MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 


@jrpantiques: @realDonaldTrump @ABCinSC @KatrinaPierson THE WORLD IS PLAYING EVERYTHING RIGHT FOR TRUMP EVERY DAY HIS POINTS ARE PROVEN 
@dlt912: @realDonaldTrump you definitely have my vote 

@Mario_Posillico: @realDonaldTrump you need to win for not just America  but for humanity  
We need much tougher  much smarter leadership and we need it NOW 
President Obama said ISIL continues to shrink in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in Paris  He is just so bad CHANGE  
My prayers are with the victims and hostages in the horrible Paris attacks  May God be with you all  




 @seanhannity Carly  whose campaign is dead  is making false statements about me in order to salvage hope Sad  
 @CarlyFiorina had to inject herself into my factual statements concerning Ben Carson in order to breathe life into her failing campaign 
 @CarlyFiorina I only said I was on @60Minutes four weeks ago with Putin—never said I was in Green Room  Separate pieces—great ratings 
 @CarlyFiorina Ben Carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper & pathological disease  I didn’t say it  he did  Apology  
 @CarlyFiorina Carly—I did graduate from Wharton and did very well  Who is your fact checker  Will you apologize  
 @CarlyFiorina Carly  not just you  I also told Gov  Kasich to “let Jeb talk  give him a chance” because Kasich was constantly cutting in  
@DRUDGE_REPORT: REUTERS 5 DAY ROLLING POLL: TRUMP 34%  CARSON 19 6%  RUBIO 9 7%  CRUZ 7 7%    Thank you a great honor 







From 2% to 27% in Texas quite a jump into first place 
Wow  pres  candidate Ben Carson  who is very weak on illegal Immigration  just said he likes amnesty and a pathway to citizenship  

 @WSJ and dopey Karl Rove made a mistake and purposely mischaracterized my statement on the terrible TPP deal https://theintercept com/2015/11/11/trump was right about tpp benefitting china/ … 
Why does the failing @WSJ write a false editorial about me and let dummy @KarlRove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper  
 @KarlRove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re China and TPP  This moron wasted $430 million on political campaigns and lost 100% 
We  as a country  either have borders or we don't  IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS  WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY 
Why wouldn't the @WSJ call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong  No wonder it is doing poorly 
When and how are the dummies at the @WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me  I want smart trade deals  
The @WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong  so often  They got info from an incorrect story in another pub  Why not watch and listen to debate  
 @WSJ Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and T P P  and apologize  China not part but will get their way in later  
Today's @WSJ Editorial is WRONG again  I know that China is not in the new T P P  trade deal but would come in latter through a back door  
I will be interviewed on @MariaBartiromo @FoxBusiness at 7:30 
All seven on line polls  including Drudge and Time  with thousands of respondents  said I won the debate  @krauthammer said I was so  so  

@BornToBeGOP: @realDonaldTrump You will bring out more voters to vote for you than we've seen in any election Great  


Will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 PM  
I will be on @marklevinshow at 8PM tonight  Tune in 
 @gerardtbaker Gerard—wonderful job last night as moderator of the debate  I told many  “really smart and elegant ” 
I never said that China was in the bad TPP trade deal but that China would come in the back door at a later date  @CNN @FoxBusiness 
Just returned home from the great state of New Hampshire  Have made so many friends there special place 
Happy Veterans Day  To those who have served  thank you for your special work  

Loved doing the debate   won Drudge and all on line polls Amazing evening  moderators did an outstanding job  
Will be on @Morning_Joe live from New Hampshire 7:00 A M  Talking about the debate and more

@burgettn: @AB1132 @realDonaldTrump it's the only way we can make America great again  
@kniala: @realDonaldTrump Exactly  Marco has no accomplishments  
@RM1792: @realDonaldTrump Man  I love the where you spoke the truth about Hillary  We have waited so long for someone to do this  
@freedoms411: @wakeuppeopleSOS @mitchellvii @CNN @ABC @CBS It shouldn't be ignored  and I doubt it will be  Carson will drop in polls  
@teed_chris: @Loyal2Trump2016 @TrumpAlabama @FoxNews Look when you try to kill Your mom that's it for me  no walking on water 
@KazmierskiR: @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr OuTsTaNdInG Is obvious that Jr  has much of his father's 'charisma' and intelligence 



Marco Rubio couldn't even respond properly to President Obama's State of the Union Speech without pouring sweat & chugging water  He choked 
Marco Rubio is a total lightweight who I wouldn’t hire to run one of my smaller companies a highly overrated politician 

Great job on @Greta @DonaldJTrumpJr  Nobody could have done it better

@salyboy3: @realDonaldTrump great job on SNL mr trump  funny funny  Thanks  

@mcjeff42: @realDonaldTrump you made SNL great again @nbcsnl 


@tegodreaux: @realDonaldTrump @EricShawnonFox HUUUUUGE 
@EmitteLucemTuam: @realDonaldTrump @EricShawnonFox Great job Donald Good luck from Canada 

 @EricShawnonFox Highest rated Saturday Night Live in four years  47% higher than their opening night with Hillary & Miley Cyrus  Nice words 
Television ratings for @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live just came out and they were great the best since 2011  Very few protesters 

At 10:30 I will be interviewed on both @meetthepress by @chucktodd and @CBSNews Face The Nation by John Dickerson  This after long evening 
I will be interviewed by @GStephanopoulos on @ABC at 10:00 A M

 @nbcsnl So much fun last night 

@mcjeff42: @realDonaldTrump you made SNL great again 
@EEGRC98: @realDonaldTrump I am Hispanic I am with you 
@syoka68: @realDonaldTrump Trump rocked SNL 
@ccakul: @realDonaldTrump it was a great show 
@PizzaPartyBen: @realDonaldTrump we need you elected tomorrow 
@jackmarchione: @realDonaldTrump Loved the show 


@redletter99: @realDonaldTrump thanks donald great show when r u coming back to massachusetts  Very soon 

@martydrinksbeer: @realDonaldTrump It was FANTASTIC 


Will be on @foxandfriends at 8:00 A M  
Amazing evening at Saturday Night Live 
I am at the Saturday Night Live Studio electricity all over the place  We will be doing a tweeting skit  so stay tuned 



@BornToBeGOP: @realDonaldTrump You want them here legally and they want to be here legally 


@RealCinders2: @realDonaldTrump use SNL to tell Hispanics you are for them   you want them to have jobs and be here legally Great idea 









They are saying that tickets to tonight's Saturday Night Live are the hardest to get in the history of this great show Off to a good start 



Saturday Night Live has some incredible things in store tonight  The great thing about playing myself is that it will be authentic Enjoy 
 @RobertGBeckel Please thank your brother for his nice words on television  Seems like a great guy and character @CNN 
@essygalloway: @realDonaldTrump @nbcsnl @Sia I can't wait to watch snl tomorrow  A really big show 



Would be nice if @jmartNYT learned how to read the polls before writing his next story  Probably done on purpose  but not good reporting 
@BillKristol has become a sad case  His magazine is failing badly  probably doesn't have long to go  and his predictions are always wrong 
@FBeadon: @realDonaldTrump don't let the Keystone Pipeline die  The US needs to be good neighbors with Canada  and energy independent  


So sad that Obama rejected Keystone Pipeline  Thousands of jobs  good for the environment  no downside 
Happy Birthday to the great @BillyGraham  He's done so many wonderful things  not the least of which is his fantastic family  I love Billy 





@bigsampolkcoga: @GovChristie @MikeHuckabeeGOP @FoxBusiness and they kept Rand Paul on the main stage  Let's get Huck and Christie back  

@BornToBeGOP: @realDonaldTrump @Robostop10 @politico How anyone could see him as president baffles me  Lies and insane theories  
@CaptainMark_: @Robostop10 KEEP IT COMMING TRUMP People need to be warned about that Carson figure who is not who they think 
Getting ready for @nbcsnl commercial pic twitter com/asHECYFBRv 


 @AJDelgado13 Thank you so much for the nice words and support really enjoy listening to your ideas and thoughts  
I think it would be a good idea—and fair—to include @GovChristie & @MikeHuckabeeGOP in the debate  Both solid & good guys  @FoxBusiness 
Carson now admits his friend named Bob  who he tried to stab (Bob was saved by his belt buckle )  no longer exists as Bob  Wrong name 
With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer  stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage don't people get it  

Florida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio  So do two people who worked with him  Said he used the wrong credit card Sure  
@rhinostate:  @realDonaldTrump @GrundleMan27 Rubio is a Manchurian Candidate  People will own him if he ever became president  



@Rick_Sa: @greta Interesting presidential race; Carson tries to beat his mom with a hammer  and @realDonaldTrump beats Carson in the polls 
@DeeMcNa: @FoxNews Silent majority did not try to kill their mothers  like Ben Carson  but wants America rebuilt by only one capable:TRUMP 
A great honor to easily finish FIRST in the @FoxNews poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner 



@SandraJenners: I love to see the respect you have shown to your parents  siblings and children  Proven Respect and Class needed in USA 
The Carson story is either a total fabrication or  if true  even worse trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend 


@marklindsay78: @Hanan_Khan2 @realDonaldTrump poll numbers are higher then most think  no one is asking Democrats if they are voting Trump 
@TeamSpringsteen: @realDonaldTrump I just finished reading Crippled America  It's a detailed blueprint to get America back on track  
@NottaLiberal: @realDonaldTrump @destiny @seanhannity No need  Everyone knows Jeb is full of blank  
@curtismuddog: @destiny @seanhannity JEB'S Whole campaign is fueled by lies  Just like his brother lied about Iraq  BUSH DYNASTY=LIES 
 @seanhannity should have corrected Jeb Bush when he said that I ran for president twice  Never ran  merely considered running

@Destiny: Why didn't @seanhannity correct Jeb when he said @realDonaldTrump has run 4 president 2X B4~Jeb needs 2B corrected b/c he lied  
@spiritofshiloh: Carson has the WORST health plan EVER re: Soc Sec and Medicare  @realDonaldTrump He wants to abolish Medicare no way 
Jeb Bush just said about Marco Rubio  he's my friend Pure political speak  Why can't he be truthful and say disloyal guy  no friend 



Just landed in New Hampshire a very exciting morning planned

@HarpAmyStabler: @FS1 @realDonaldTrump @ColinCowherd this interview is great  
@kingster73: @realDonaldTrump Rubio is irresponsible on finances and doesn't show up for work Who would hire him  Not the American People 
@TdavisTonya: @brucedhendrix @Poetry4Bitcoin Nope  Trump isn't taking 2 weeks off to promote his book  Trump is donating all to charity 
@kemper34: @TheHerd @ColinCowherd @realDonaldTrump @FS1 Great interview  Ranks just above the @JimHarbaugh49 interview  
@theBrandonMcKee: Read all about the Wollman deal and many other successful deals in The Art of the Deal by @realDonaldTrump 

@johndorlando1: @ArizonaLuke @realDonaldTrump @JoeTrippi @FoxNews his crowds are huge   hard to think he is going to lose  
@TrumpFix: @meganena13 @robertew2945 agreed Luisa  @realDonaldTrump WILL WIN This is what he does 
@DDietlin3: @ColinCowherd fantastic job with your interview with @realDonaldTrump today 

My interview with @jheil & @MarkHalperin at @WollmanRink airing at 5PM on @bpolitics pic twitter com/qErQu7CeEH 

 @CharlesMBlow Why don’t you use new polls instead of the single ancient national poll that was a tiny bit negative  Dishonest reporting 

Thank you Carl Higbie (former Navy Seal) for you support of my plan to straighten out the Veterans Administration a mess Great job @kilmeade 


@taurus82409: @Morning_Joe DONALD TRUMP is the absolute WINNER You heads try to talk around him  WHY  WHY    Go TRUMP

@LandmanMarius: @realDonaldTrump @robmont777 @StrengthenTheUS @GOP WE ACCEPT THE BEST  We want Trump 
@DAMRON88: @realDonaldTrump @BornToBeGOP I sure in the hell hope so  Trump please make this country great again  
@Truth_or_Rumor: @realDonaldTrump It's not so much that Iran made a good deal  it's that Kerry and Obama gave away the store  O K  

@HenryTheZebra: @realDonaldTrump America needs you to start your 8 year shift a bit early to start fixing this disaster  


Now that Iran ripped us off by making one of the best deals of any kind in history  they have just moved to block any imports from the U S  
@BornToBeGOP: @realDonaldTrump 9 years from now we will thank President Trump for making us great again Thank you 
I will be on Sirius XM RADIO  National News Show  at 7:30 A M  (Monday) hosted by the great Steve Bannon  @BreitbartNews 

While in politics it is often smart to send out false messages  one thing is clear: That Hillary does not want to run against TRUMP  

If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate  BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered 
Marco Rubio will not win  Weak on illegal immigration  strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a lightweight   
I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other  Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor 
Jeb's new slogan Jeb can fix it   I never thought of Jeb as a crook Stupid message  the word fix is not a good one to use in politics 

Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's  Mr  Amnesty  endorsement Rubs can't win 
@BellicWolf: @and_is_w Anyway  for me the most original costume was Donald Trump like President 

@N_R_Mandela: @realDonaldTrump And you're still a negative loser and Trump is still a positive winner  I'm Black and proudly voting TRUMP 


Gov  John Kasich has really failed on the campaign trail  I thought he would have been far more talented  He is just wasting time & money 
@SueSabo: MEDIA WANTS A PUPPET WE WANT DONALD TRUMP TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN  LAST CHANCE TO MAKE AMERICA GREAThttps://twitter com/aduanebrown/status/658015621515362304 … 





@KatyTurNBC: This is the most focused Trump stump I've heard really drilling down on vets issues here in Virginia  
 @thehill John Oliver had his people call to ask me to be on his very boring and low rated show  I said NO THANKS Waste of time & energy 
Few people know that @FortuneMagazine is still in business  Tell your writer Alisa Soloman that I left The Apprentice to run for president 

@BorderWall: Floridian here I quit watching debates years ago & most TV except GATOR football until you decided to run for President 
@sean_in_NH: @realDonaldTrump @realOllieTaylor so true  In all previous debates  no one watched and they were cancelled 


@JodiL792: @realDonaldTrump I wouldn't be watching at all Honestly 
@antSTACKSgrieco: @realDonaldTrump you were great in it Thanks 
@realOllieTaylor: @realDonaldTrump no one would have watched the debates if Trump had not been in them 
@Rketeltas: @realDonaldTrump has won all three debates and all that matters is that Trump supporters know that & will vote Trump THANKS 
@shawnslawns4u: @terrykimk93 @WSJ this coming election is THE MOST IMPORTANT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION in my lifetime VOTE FOR TRUMP 
@danlifting: @realDonaldTrump I wouldn't watch it at all if Mr  trump was not on it  See u on your book signing on 11/3  Trump all the way  

No complaints but how many people would be watching these really dumb but record setting debates if I wasn't in them  Interesting question 
@terrykimk93: @realDonaldTrump @WSJ Go Trump GO Vote Trump 
Thank you James Freeman of the @WSJ for the very nice words  All polls said I won the debate except NBC (3rd)  Explain to Daniel Henninger 

Support Coach Kennedy and his right  together with his young players  to pray on the football field  Liberty Institute just suspended him 

 @ColinCowherd said such nice things about me during the debate that I thought I'd do his show  @TheHerd  on Monday (2:30pm EST)  


@MarshallFSmith: @LexingtonBobby @realDonaldTrump And its a Glorious Fall Day in Norfolk Knock'em dead Donald Thanks 
@WavRidr101: @realDonaldTrump DO A FLYOVER @NauticusNorfolk USS WISCONSIN Cool idea  we will try 
The @WSJ Wall Street Journal loves to write badly about me  They better be careful or I will unleash big time on them  Look forward to it 
Lifting off right now for U S S  Wisconsin in Norfolk  See ya' 
I told you so @politico just lost it's top person  Poor results and no money to pay him  If they were legit  they would be doing far better 
I am leaving for Norfolk  Virginia the great battleship U S S  Wisconsin for a big rally and really big crowd  See you soon 
I see Marco Rubio just landed another billionaire to give big money to his Superpac  which are total scams  Marco must address him as SIR 

Black Lives Matter protesters totally disrupt Hillary Clinton event  She looked lost  This is not what we need with ISIS  CHINA  RUSSIA etc  
@dalva1616: So true Vote @realDonaldTrump and have America greatness back to where it belongs : The United States of America  

I am going to save Medicare and Medicaid  Carson wants to abolish  and failing candidate Gov  John Kasich doesn't have a clue weak 
When candidate John Kasich  on the @oreillyfactor  talked about dismantling Medicare and Medicaid  he was referring to Ben Carson  


@JackDix03868724: Arizona polls for Democrats only say they would prefer Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton 60% 



@BornToBeGOP: @realDonaldTrump you are always many steps ahead of the game Thank you  
@jimmcvey1: @eddiern @DeusVultUSMC @deadeyemadoc @smithsj1 Trump is the closest thing to Gen Patton that we will ever see again  Cool 

@Roadstarr1: @realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee @FoxNews Mike Huckabee is a very nice gentleman and yes Donald you raised wonderful children 
@smithsj1: @realDonaldTrump Mr  Trump do you swear to provide for  protect and care for our soldiers  including Vets  YES  YES  YES 
 @GovMikeHuckabee Great job on @FoxNews tonight  Thanks for your nice words about my children  Class

My interview on @ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos had a 40% ratings increase over same Sunday last year  20% over last week

@SteveBashino: Trump good for legal immigration  economy  defense  taxes  Social Security  Medicare  2nd Amendment  and ALL Americans  
@derekcarlson: DonaldTrump turned a $1 Million loan into $10 Billion  That's like you turning a $1 000 loan into $10 Million  CouldYouDoIt  

Thank you to everybody for your wonderful comments on my debate performance it was a lot of fun Today I will be speaking in Reno  Nevada  
@8723g: One thing I learned from @realDonaldTrump : Sometimes the best deals are the deals you never make We will have strong deal makers 
@AtheistWWonka: @realDonaldTrump @jakistheman by the time you're done everyone will be wearing a Trump tie 
@eVDefuse: @realDonaldTrump they should just let you be president already  you're already leading in the polls  
@jakistheman: @realDonaldTrump keep you're momentum until you win over the White House 

@truthinvest: @ChrisChristie @HillaryClinton good job for Christie last night Maybe he will face her 8 yrs from now after @realDonaldTrump 

Thank you @morningmika and @JoeNBC for all of your nice words and comments on the debate 


The money losing @politico is considered by many in the world of politics to be the dumbest and most slanted of the political sites  Losers 


@Sisters4everT: Good Night all supporters  Great night Mr @realDonaldTrump  You ROCKED the Rocky Mountains & the Nation tonight 

@ngb6060: @realDonaldTrump showing why he should be our next President  Tremendous Debate  Winning all the post Debate polls  





@BarbaraDeStasio: @realDonaldTrump GREAT debate  way to go 
@hyatt1942: @realDonaldTrump @piersmorgan WE ALL VOTED FOR YOU TONIGHT AS WINNER OF THE DEBATE   
Thanks  @PiersMorgan  You're great 


Thanks everyone  they all said I won the debate  Even won the @CNBC Poll 

@jaxsiete: @realDonaldTrump Love your sense of humor   LOL Your rallies are amazing  We're standing behind you 1000%:) @FoxNews 
@CNBC POLL TOTAL: TRUMP 25 22 CARSON 19 78 RUBIO 9 67     
 @TheEconomist Poll  one of the most highly respected  was just released  Wow  wait until the media digests these numbers won't be happy 


@Vaporcon2015: @realDonaldTrump The Liberals are terrified that you'll be the one to go against Hillary  
@cmrose111: @realDonaldTrump @CNBC get your polls straight  Trump is going to win  He is the only one tough enough to run this country  
@mozarttaig1: @CNBC is trying to drive down poll numbers to install Carson who the Establishment GOP will promptly roll  Win Don Win 
Does anybody think that @CNBC will get their fictitious polling numbers corrected sometime prior to the start of the debate  Sad 
@1Barbara1: @realDonaldTrump @Morning_Joe @politico I watched the entire rally and Trump was very well received the place was packed  
 @Morning_Joe can you believe Kasie Hunt's poor and purposely inaccurate reporting on my great night and crowd in Iowa  @politico is a scam 
 @CNBC continues to report fictious poll numbers  Number one  based on every statistic  is Trump (by a wide margin)  They just can't say it 
After a great evening and packed auditorium in Iowa  I am now in Colorado looking forward to what I am sure will be a very unfair debate 

@JayknightJay: @RealBenCarson good morning  Easy on each other & finish off the establishment guys  They hope you 2 will fight it out  True 



@2bigj: @realDonaldTrump A lot of people I know are voting Trump in NC none have been polled your lead is bigger than anyone can imagine  
@laura_damron: @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump This Hispanic woman believes Trump has the brains & energy to Make America Great Again   
@RickSt  How many MSM outlets will carry a clip of @realDonaldTrump leaving the podium to enter a crowd & listen to the concerns of a VET  


@fairy_tabibi: Loved seeing @realDonaldTrump speak to the wounded warrior & his family He has a caring heart and will take care of our vets 


@Rketeltas: @realDonaldTrump At least the real frontrunner is actually campaigning in Iowa and not on book tours  TRUMP 2016 

@faagifts: @OANN WTG  GREAT JOB  U R THE BEST PICK OUT OF ALL OF THE CANDIDATES & OHIO KNOWS THIS 2 THAT IS WHY U R LEADING THERE TOO 
I am leaving for Sioux City  Iowa great event (rally)  


Thank you @SahilKapur for the wonderful story http://www bloomberg com/politics/articles/2015 10 27/why donald trump could win the republican nomination … 

@RhatPatriot: @FoxBusiness @realDonaldTrump Why not post the other polls where Trump has 40 percent and Carson is in the teens  Strange  
@bawl: I agree @BillKristol hasn't be right about anything in a very long time  Shocking that @Morning_Joe gives him a platform  
@JordanDworaczyk: @DrHawk12 @elvisknievil I'm voting for @realDonaldTrump too  Thanks  

@AlbertoMarsano: @realDonaldTrump Looking forward to seeing you in Reno Nevada this Thursday Nevada stands with you Nice  
@TheJusticeEngle: @realDonaldTrump I'm 18 years old from Florida  and just registered to vote  You got my vote in the primaries THANKS  

@BobD746847: There shouldn't be a problem with this election  WE THE PEOPLE finally have someone that speaks on OUR behalf  TRUMP 2016 
@coloradojoe2001: How is any one taking Carson seriously when he suspends his presidential campaign for a book signing tour  
Dopey @BillKristol  who has lost all credibility with so many dumb statements and picks  said last week on @Morning_Joe that Biden was in  

All Presidential candidates should immediately disavow their Super PAC’s  They're not only breaking the spirit of the law but the law itself 
Re Super PAC scam: What the other candidates are doing is a disgrace  
This whole Super PAC scam is very unfair to a person like me who has disavowed all PAC's & is self funding  

@hoosierclinger: Good job @realDonaldTrump for badgering Ford  Why didnt POTUS or Hillary care about those UAW jobs in Ohio  
@maria_heck: @RobertsLiardon @realDonaldTrump  The more I hear Trump the more I like him 

Ben Carson wants to abolish Medicare I want to save it and Social Security  

Leaving for New Hampshire now  Will be doing the @TODAYshow there  live at 7:00 A M  New @CBSNews Poll of New Hampshire: Trump 38 Carson 12 

Remember that Carson  Bush and Rubio are VERY weak on illegal immigration  They will do NOTHING to stop it  Our country will be overrun 
@Rketeltas: @realDonaldTrump Bush appears to be low on cash may need to do drop out or perhaps get a loan from Hillary  

@mmolina44: @realDonaldTrump @ByronYork @CBSNews @CNN Donald Trump will be our next President of the United States  

@jfgrcar: @realDonaldTrump Gentle Ben is no match for Putin or if the truth be told even for Hilary  USA needs a winner  
Do you think I will get credit for keeping Ford in U S  Who cares  my supporters know the truth  Think what can be done as president 
Word is that Ford Motor  because of my constant badgering at packed events  is going to cancel their deal to go to Mexico and stay in U S  


@Thuglife602: @realDonaldTrump Bad position for Jeb  if his Mommy  Daddy and brother get involved the skeletons come back out of the closet 
@cospy8: @realDonaldTrump @ByronYork @CBSNews @CNN WAY ahead in all the polls that matter  TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT 




@Tirolian2: @realDonaldTrump @ByronYork @CBSNews @CNN # TRUMP is Unstoppable Thank you  
@concerningtimes: @JebBush needs to drop out your  hurting the republican cause   @realDonaldTrump is our choice 
@thatgirlflorida: @realDonaldTrump @ByronYork @CBSNews @CNN Florida Loves Trump We had a ball in Jacksonville Saturday 
 @ByronYork Great numbers from @CBSNews Poll  Also from ABC Washington Post Poll  Thank you @CNN 
Do you believe that @FoxNews is still playing up the old Iowa poll numbers and no mention of the ABCWashington Post or just out CBS results  
 @CBSNews Poll WOW New Hampshire TRUMP 38% CARSON 12% BUSH 8% South Carolina TRUMP 40% CARSON 23% CRUZ 8% Iowa TRUMP 27% CARSON 27% 
Watch my interview on @CBSNews Face The Nation now and  also  the new CBS POLLS which  if good for me  the media won't report 

@ron_fournier:  @realDonaldTrump rightly denounces Super PAC driven campaign $ system  Another example of how DC deserves this guy Great 
@russia890: @CNNPolitics @realDonaldTrump Trump is the smartest of all  My comment is non partisan  I heard everybody n im on Trump side  

Big poll comes out today on Face The Nation at 10:30 on @CBSNews  
Watch @CNN at 9:00 A M  @jaketapper  Then interviewed on @ABC @GStephanopoulos at 10:00 A M  and then  at 10:30 A M   watch Face The Nation  
Ben Carson has never created a job in his life (well  maybe a nurse)  I have created tens of thousands of jobs  it's what I do  
I spell out some of the differences between Ben Carson and myself at 9:00 A M  on @CNN @jaketapper  Ben is very weak on illegal immigration  
A big POLL will be announced this morning on @CBSNews Face The Nation  I wonder if I do well if the press will report the results  Doubt it 
@LandmanMarius: @realDonaldTrump AUSTRALIA SUPPORTS DONALD TRUMP  Please immigrate to Australia and make Aussie great as well  Cute 

This is just not the right time for Jeb Bush  His campaign is in total disarray  too much staff being paid way too much money = U S  GOVT  

I will be doing a major sit down interview on State of the Union With Jake Tapper at 9:00 A M  on @CNN  Enjoy 



@JaredChristophr: Donald Trump is the only person that can make this country great again @realDonaldTrump I fully agree 
@Bane1349: They ALL Want Jobs and a Bright Future  They KNOW Donald Trump is the one and only choice to make that A REALITY 


While Jeb Bush is cutting staff and salaries  after having paid ridiculous amounts of money  why did he pay so much in the first place  

@HankCampbell: Democrats seem to be more interested in Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton  

 @JebBush is slashing campaign salaries  people making millions  If he can't manage his campaign  how can he manage our countries finances  

 @JebBush is totally lost he spends too much time managing the bloated staff of his campaign & not enough talking about America's future  


Will be doing a sit down interview with @JakeTapper @CNN on Sunday morning at 9:00  Tough questions and hopefully very good answers 
Just finished speaking in Jacksonville  Florida  Incredible crowd  fantastic people  Thank you 

Leaving for Jacksonville now  See you there Miami was great

@i_am__tyler @MichaelCohen212 I can promise you the only reason I watched the democrat's debate is because of @realDonaldTrump 
I think Joe Biden made correct decision for him & his family  Personally  I would rather run against Hillary because her record is so bad

See  the attack very possibly could have been stopped  We need real leadership and vision http://www buzzfeed com/andrewkaczynski/over a year before 911 trump wrote of terror threat with rem# jqGL4JMjk … 

Interesting reading re September 11thhttp://www nytimes com/2012/09/11/opinion/the bush white house was deaf to 9 11 warnings html _r=0 … 


Jeb is fighting to defend a catastrophic event  I am fighting to make sure it doesn't happen again Jeb is too soft we need tougher & sharper 
It's really cold outside  they are calling it a major freeze  weeks ahead of normal  Man  we could use a big fat dose of global warming 





@theratzpack: @Svingali @FoxNews @megynkelly i don't care if she jumps on the train  be gr8 if she were just FAIR and BALANCED 

@Weaverinc31: The problem is @MittRomney was a weak establishment candidate who couldn't even turn out the base  Weak at best 
@vbonina: @ConserveCast @GeorgeWill why does Fox even talk to Will  He is clueless and doesn't represent what our party is about  
@Crowebar_67: @megynkelly Been boycotting her since 1st debate Mr  Trump and so have plenty of other decent people  Ratings R going down 

@ChefMama32: @realDonaldTrump Good interview with Chris Chris even gave you a thumbs up for POTUS 
@ConserveCast: The Definition of a Pretentious Establishment Henchman is @GeorgeWill   He is such a sourpuss  HATES @realDonaldTrump 
Best thing my supporters can do if you don't like the way @megynkelly and her puppets unfairly treat us is don't watch her show 
@Karen05866992: @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews So far this is one of the BEST interviews with Trump  
@Justice41ca: @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I'm watching it again right now in California 
@Svingali: @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Can't wait for @megynkelly to jump on the TRUMP Train as Chris Wallace just did Won't happen

Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace will be re broadcast on @FoxNews at 6:00 P M  

@Kellmat2: @realDonaldTrump @RD_2008 @JebBush Jeb is no conservative in my book  Common core is a disaster  
@RD_2008: @JebBush Quit Jeb Quit  Your poll is even lower than your apprentice Rubio  @realDonaldTrump 
@MarcosTheJackal: @realDonaldTrump @d_seaman jebbush marcorubio: How could those two think they can compete with you  You are a legend  
@Tuvarkz: @realDonaldTrump Can't Stump the Trump 

@American1st: @ofccadjust @AnnCoulter GW Bush was open borders like @JebBush  TERRORISTS CAN COME ACROSS MEXICAN BORDER AT WILL 
@Pappenjazz: An Incredibly Strong Interview Of @realDonaldTrump @FoxNewsSunday  Good Response IC Those @FoxNews NaySayers dissapating 
@UndEngel: @realDonaldTrump @AnnCoulter Couldn't have said it  better    Nothing fake about you  sir  

@AnnCoulter: Read this DJT full p ad from 1989 and tell me DonaldTrump is a Johnny Come Lately fake conservative:pic twitter com/DBNIc3MIOl 
@AnnCoulter:He's right  Trump on 9/11 happening on Bush's watch: With my immigration policy  I doubt those ppl wld have been in the country 
Just reported by CNN that the Trump halo effect caused a record shattering Democratic Debate rating of 15 3 million viewers  So true 
It's amazing that some of the dumbest people on television work for the Wall Street Journal  in particular a real dope named Charles Lane 
@DefendingtheUSA: @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews LOVED the brutal zinger against the Wall Street Journal 
@DefendingtheUSA: @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews LOVED the brutal zinger against the Wall Street journal 
I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace at 2:00 P M  on @FoxNews Turn off the football for 15 minutes  Make America Great Again 
Replay of Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace at 2:00 P M  on @FoxNews  Big statement made by Chris 
@mesiaindo: @chazermann26 I don't think @NBC will cave  They've seen ratings soar with @realDonaldTrump and Money matters 

@danlifting: @realDonaldTrump Get a life George Will  USA doesn't make anything anymore  TRUMP will bring manufacturing Back to USA 
I should release the sad and totally apologetic letter that Penn @pennjillette hand delivered to me  Minds would be changed very fast 
@AdamBlickstein:I never thought I'd say this but @realDonaldTrump sparking a critical conversation on reality that Bush didn't keep US safe 
@smr111382: @realDonaldTrump One of the best interviews I have seen @FoxNews 
@BBCARKING: @JoeTrippi @realDonaldTrump @scottienhughes Joe have U resigned to the inevitable  Take UR seat on thepic twitter com/SIppNYk834 
@WalterEKurtzJr: @realDonaldTrump Chris Wallace: After my interview and listening to his answers  I think Donald Trump could be President 



Does everyone remember @MittRomney and his famous remarks about self deportation and 47%   He was done  I don't need his angry advice 
 @MittRomney and his campaign manager should not be critical of candidates after they blew an election that should never have been lost 
 @MittRomney can only speak negatively about my presidential chances because I have been openly hard on his terrible choke loss to Obama 

 @FoxNewsSunday 
Jeb  why did your brother attack and destabalize the Middle East by attacking Iraq when there were no weapons of mass destruction  Bad info  
This morning Chris Wallace has the best political show on television but that's only because I'm on it (kidding) Have fun  
Jeb Bush should stop trying to defend his brother and focus on his own shortcomings and how to fix them  Also  Rubio is hitting him hard 
On at 9:00A M  or 10:00 A M  (depending on your location) on Fox is a tough but really good interview with Chris Wallace  Enjoy 


@mklloydva: Some of you already know  I have made the Jump to Trump  Donald Trump is the man that will win the GOP http://fb me/PsB9hl7n  
@bk2seattle: @realDonaldTrump I was with you in Tyngsboro  Ma  last night You WILL be our next President What a fantastic evening 
@HL3tweets: Jeb and Marco OWE IT to their contributors to admit they have NO CHANCE of winning  and figure out how to PAY BACK everyone 
@vlynpowell: @realDonaldTrump At happy hour tonight in Charleston  SC  everyone at the bar said they were supporting Donald Trump  Thanks 
Good news for those that want to Make America Great Again I am winning every poll in every STATE and NATIONAL and by big numbers Thanks

 @KatrinaPierson  you did a fantastic job tonight on @FoxNews  Thank you for your very tough and very smart representation 
@myhealthcoach1: @NoahGrayCNN Thank You Police Force for your efforts of Protecting Donald Trump We Love You For This  God Bless You 

No @JebBush  you’re pathetic for saying nothing happened during your brother’s term when the World Trade Center was attacked and came down  

 @JebBush  At the debate you said your brother kept us safe I wanted to be nice & did not mention the WTC came down during his watch  9/11  


Rumor has it that the grubby head of failing @VanityFair Magazine  Sloppy Graydon Carter  is going to be fired or replaced very soon  

Nice story from @businessinsiderhttp://read bi/1VVL5WU  
 @scottienhughes Keep up the great work Scottie  Polls are best ever 


@jimmy_jkmorgan: @JoeyL3rd @foxandfriends @EricTrump Totally agree Great Father with a great family winning combination at life  Thanks 
@JohnNew2015: @lance_combrink Well  @KarlRove is an establishment hack big government RINO whose only hope is @JebBush That's sad  eh   
@Pjdahling: @mitchellvii the truth prevails when it is so obvious  @realDonaldTrump is a force that is unstoppable 
@SHLOMO_ABADDON: @TODAYshow @MLauer @realDonaldTrump Matt will vote for Trump i just know he will 
@JoeyL3rd: @foxandfriends @EricTrump Grt interview  I'm telling ya  @realDonaldTrump children r going 2 b a HUGE asset 2 him & his campaign 
 @EricTrump was FANTASTIC on @foxandfriends this morning  He may be my son but he is a special guy 
 @CNBC has just agreed that the debate will be TWO HOURS  Fantastic news for all  especially the millions of people who will be watching 
@lance_combrink: @realDonaldTrump Karl Rove still thinks Romney won  Why is he still on TV  
@Hohummm: Did you also hear Megyn say Carson is the front runner    according so some polls   tied in other polls OUTRIGHT LIE Hatred 
@RickStans1: Donald  Megyn Kelly seeks ratings  not truth Not much of a journalist  Stay focused & make your own narrative  It's working 
Every poll  Time  Drudge  Slate and others  said I won both debates but heard Megyn Kelly had her two puppets say bad stuff  I don't watch 
 @marcthiessen is a failed Bush speechwriter whose work was so bad that he has never been able to make a comeback  A third rate talent 

Megyn Kelly has two really dumb puppets  Chris Stirewalt & Marc Threaten (a Bushy) who do exactly what she says  All polls say I won debates 
@RedScareBot: @brandongordy1: @realDonaldTrump is what we millennials need  I used to support that socialist from VT  what a mistake  
@bigmikeobrien: @EricTrump @skyjones55 @greta @FoxNews @oreillyfactor @CarlRove is in the tank for Bush we are tired of the establishment 

@davidaxelrod:  Met @IvankaTrump a few years back  DonaldTrump is wise to enlist his daughter's help  She's a throughly impressive person  
Will be on @bloombergtv tomorrow with @sruhle  Enjoy 

 @CNBC is pushing the @GOP around by asking for extra time (and no criteria) in order to sell more commercials  
The @GOP should not agree to the ridiculous debate terms that @CNBC is asking unless there is a major benefit to the party

Steven Tyler got more publicity on his song request than he’s gotten in ten years  Good for him 
Even though I have the legal right to use Steven Tyler’s song  he asked me not to  Have better one to take its place 
Will be going to Richmond  Virginia today  Big crowd See you there  
The debate last night proved that Hillary is running against the “B” team  She won’t be so lucky when it comes to me 


Like her or not  Hillary did what she had to do in the debate last night—get through it  Her opponents were very gentle and soft 

@releafpen: Dem debate message summary = More free handouts  They will be voting in droves  We need to get out and vote Trump BIG TIME 

@Angie58493041: @sadmexi @realDonaldTrump sucess of Mr Trump is another success of america 2015

@mcowgerFL: @realDonaldTrump Thank you for ALWAYS REMEMBERING America's veterans 


@Jtrink97: @Hell0ThereLydia @realDonaldTrump his commentary is making an otherwise shitty night outstanding Thanks  
@ObamaTax: After @hillaryclinton poor performance  waffling in debates  @Teamsters14 should support @realDonaldTrump 

Sanders said only black lives matter wow Hillary did not answer question 
@i_am__tyler: I can't wait for @realDonaldTrump to debate one of these clowns All are so weak 

@TS01171980: @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump isn't on the stage  turning this garbage off 

@RealNinjetta: @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle Why did Hillary get to skate past the Do Black Lives Matter Anderson let her off hook 
@julieruot: I want a president who believes all lives matter and that is why we need @realDonaldTrump  
Sorry  there is no STAR on the stage tonight 
Good move by Bernie S  
The hardest thing Clinton has to do is defend her bad decision making including Iraq vote  e mails etc  
All are very scripted and rehearsed  two (at least) should not be on the stage  
@Achilarre: I couldn't even imagine the bloodbath that would ensue if the @realDonaldTrump debated any one of these five jabronis 

@mikerichterp: @realDonaldTrump I joined Twitter tonight just to hear Mr Trump tweet about this silly debate  
@Iamnewhere: Webb is trying to be @realDonaldTrump and its not working  He is not doing well 
@DNorrell: This is one of the most dysfunctional debates I've seen in my lifetime  @realDonaldTrump 
@NexiaVauxhall: @realDonaldTrump I love that NO group can buy @realDonaldTrump 

@Pandorasandy1: @realDonaldTrump we need Donald Trump to make America great again Thanks 

@FEDEnergy: @NRA @nranews Support the NRA more then ever  @nationalrifle needs to back @realDonaldTrump who wants to protect 2nd amendment 
@theericker: @realDonaldTrump not watching debate    just your tweets Nice 
@jennasnowy69: @realDonaldTrump why is Webb there   

@JuliaTock: @realDonaldTrump Sure you are laughing listening to these 5 try and explain how business and the economy works  Scary 
@LaurenDa123: @realDonaldTrump I think @JebBush and @marcorubio are supposed to be on this stage 

@rjdicksii: @realDonaldTrump  These cats are like bad used car salesmen  

@maxxgadog: @LindaSuhler @realDonaldTrump if you got rid of commercials you would have nothing worth watching 

O'Malley  as former Mayor of Baltimore  has very little chance  
Can anyone imagine Chafee as president  No way  
@tr3s3can: @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump Make America Great Again Would not even watch Dem debate except Donald is tweeting about it 
@amd9890:  @realDonaldTrump was right   #DemDebate is boring these ppl are so scripted So far 

@MichaelTribunel: @realDonaldTrump imagine Chafey standing up to Putin 

@0Nonsense: @realDonaldTrump Good luck commenting on this snooze fest  I'm out  



@HL3tweets: @TDsVoice @CNN @CNNPolitics I'm watching now and will watch the entire debate while reading Trump's Tweets  Grab the popcorn 



We will all have fun and hopefully learn something tonight  I will shoot straight and call it as I see it  both the good and the bad  Enjoy

@hapearce1: @realDonaldTrump they need to take the debate slow  a lot of low energy on the stage tonight  I hope not 
@StreckerJosh: The Hillary love fest on CNN is ridiculous  I feel bad for the other candidates   especially the non criminal ones  
@xai7126: @greta I'd rather see @realDonaldTrump be the debate moderator 
Should be interesting but too bad the three guys at《1% will be taking up so much time but who knows  maybe a star will be born (unlikely) 
@ElviNichols: Will @CNN be tough as they were with @realDonaldTrump   No way  they will want to be soooo nice 

@007lLisav: @CNN @realDonaldTrump @CNNPolitics can't wait for his insightful & intelligent tweets  You sound like a very smart person

How can Jeb Bush expect to deal with China  Russia Iran if he gets caught doing a “plant” during my speech yesterday in NH  
So nice  thank you very much https://twitter com/JosephMonaco/status/653735644351590401 …

The arrogant young woman who questioned me in such a nasty fashion at No Labels yesterday was a Jeb staffer HOW CAN HE BEAT RUSSIA & CHINA  
Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet  I agree 




Someone should inform @CNN that  despite spending millions of $'s on graphics  it is not the Democratic Debate  rather the Democrat (s) D 
At the request of many  and even though I expect it to be a very boring two hours  I will be covering the Democrat Debate live on twitter

Leaving soon after a great time in New Hampshire  a truly special place 
Great  everyone is saying I did much better on @60Minutes last week than President Obama did tonight  I agree 
President Obama was terrible on @60Minutes tonight  He said CLIMATE CHANGE is the most important thing  not all of the current disasters 


@TheFix: Tuesday's Democratic debate is missing just one thing: Donald Trump  True  can you think of anyone who wants to watch  
I will be on Face The Nation (CBS) today at 10:30 A M  and Media Buzz (Fox News) at 11:00 A M  Enjoy 
@Clint_Goodrich: They used to call Barry Diller the father of e commerce what a joke that was and that he is  100%clueless on Internet 
Just got back from Georgia  The crowds and love for U S  was so amazing We all had a great day together will be back soon 
Little Barry Diller  who lost a fortune on Newsweek and Daily Beast  only writes badly about me  He is a sad and pathetic figure  Lives lie 

With the fantastic ratings last weekend  @meetthepress & @ThisWeekABC  I think it’s only fair that I go on @FoxNewsSunday w/ Chris Wallace  
Will be interviewed on @FaceTheNation with @JDickerson tomorrow at 10:30am EST  Enjoy 

 @ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos had fantastic numbers last Sunday Trump interview  Nice 

 @ChuckTodd just informed us that my interview last week on @MeetthePress was their highest rated show in 4 years  Congrats 
I'm leading big in every poll and we are going to WIN Remember  Trump NEVER gives up 
Paul Ryan is far from my first choice  but a very nice guy  The Republicans should go for tough and (very) smart this time no games

Heading to a packed house in Waterloo  Iowa Will celebrate today's great poll numbers together  See you soon 
If Stuart Stevens' book is as bad as his horrible political advice to Mitt Romney  don't waste your money  Arrogant guy but a zero

@EthaBrooke: @MittRomney Like always you are telling the truth I liked Romney and voted for him but he didn't fight hard enough  True 
@msann43: How can Illinois keep @realDonaldTrump off the ballot  Illinois citizens should protest  Just another phony Politico story  Easy 
@barreto_eugenio: @MittRomney it's sad  but GOP does not want you as their candidate  But we the people do  Latinos for Trump  
 @MittRomney is trying to hit back at me because I'm saying that he let the Repub Party down w/ his loss to Obama  Should've won—he choked

Interesting  polls on who won the GOP debate pic twitter com/iB6NGQsg5v 

Wow  so nice Thank you Wayne Allyn Root http://www theblaze com/contributions/with tax plan donald is the new ronald/ … 



Rubio is totally owned by the lobbyists and special interests  A lightweight senator with the worst voting record in Senate  Lazy 
@kissmeandrocco: @realDonaldTrump who ever thinks Donald trump is a bad person u just don't want a good country Thank you  
Just read that Trump has the largest (and I add most enthusiastic) crowds  Tonight I will be in New Hampshire the place will be packed 
I watched lightweight Senator Marco Rubio  who is all talk and no action  defend his WEAK position on illegal immigration  Pathetic 

Carl Icahn said this about me: I think at this moment in time  he’s the only candidate that speaks out about the country’s problems  
Definitely watch @Carl_C_Icahn ‘s ‘Danger Ahead’  Very insightful  particularly on how corp inversions hurt America:http://www CarlIcahn com  
I hope when Rand Paul gets out of the race—he is at 1% his supporters come over to me  I will do a much better job for them  
Prediction: Rand Paul has been driven out of the race by my statements about him he will announce soon  1% 
@polina6: @realDonaldTrump MAN WITH A PLAN THE BEST TAX PLAN GO TRUMP 2016

@JodiL792: @DefendingtheUSA @america_trump @60Minutes Thats exactly what I thought  We haven't had great leader since Reagan&now Trump 
@yang_karl: All Scott Pelley did by being disrespectful was make it easier to make up my mind who to vote for and that will be Trump  

@JennaLeeUSA: When asked why he has his own magazine covers on his walls @realDonaldTrump replies: It's cheaper than wall paper    Ha 
@SkyeShepard: Trump went way up in my 'poll' when he said he'd take money from what US is giving 2 other countries 2 save social security

@itsblakec: @realDonaldTrump we are tired of lies  Trump 2016 

@TheIntellect111: @realDonaldTrump Mr Trump Please Do not give in You are Changing History  We Need you as our Next Leader  Its Your Time 
Marco Rubio is a member of the Gang Of Eight or  very weak on stopping illegal immigration  Only changed when poll numbers crashed  

@taurus82409: @CBS @60Minutes Look forward to it  Donald  You are doing Great Please keep up the fight  many of us are behind you 100% 
Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is VERY weak on immigration  knows nothing about finance and would be incapable of making great trade deals 
@realDonaldTrump: I will be on @cbs @60minutes this Sunday  A great honor hope you enjoy it  
@Vote_Trump: Think about it  When's the last time a Prez actually did what he said  TRUMP does what he says  Will Be Greatest Prez Ever

 @MarcoRubio is weak on illegal immigration and will allow anyone into the country      
Dishonest @politico just called to say that none of the polls including Fox  NBC  CNN  Zogby  & Morning Consult matter  Serious haters  

I am now inspecting the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue will be a great hotel  Soon off to the Oklahoma State Fair 
     Ahead of schedule and under budget Will be in Oklahoma tonight 
Great reception in D C  At the Values Voter Summit  Now checking on my job at the Old Post Office    
@Rketeltas: @JoeMarzocco Waiting for the biased media to write about the 30 000 Carly fired as a failed CEO  America is for Trump 
 @megynkelly  the @FoxNews poll said very plainly I came in second in the debate  All others  Time  Drudge  Slate etc  said I came in 1st  

@yayala19: @marcorubio WHAT THE LOBBYISTS  THE MEDIA AND CAREER POLITICIANS WILL DO NEXT TO TRY TO STOP TRUMP  SILENT MAJORITY IS BACK 
Just watched @marcorubio on television  Just another all talk  no action  politician  Truly doesn't have a clue Worst voting record in Sen  
@yayala19: @politico WHEN THE OTHER CANDIDATES ARE TALKING POLITICS TRUMP IS TALKING SOLUTIONS  HE IS THE MOST TALENTED CANDIDATE  

The failing @politico news outlet  which I hear is losing lots of money  is really dishonest 
 @politico  which is not read or respected by many  may be the most dishonest of the media outlets and that is saying something  

Bloomberg: Trump leads GOP fieldhttps://twitter com/bpolitics/status/646976362394308608 … 
Despite the establishment and the media’s best efforts  the people are speaking loudly and clearly  Thank you to my amazing supporters 

So happy about my daughter @IvankaTrump’s announcement that she will be having a baby this spring  Congratulations 
Will be on @Morning_Joe at 6:30 A M  
Will be on @CNN at 7:00 A M  
 @FoxNews owes me an apology for allowing clueless pundit @RichLowry to use such foul language on TV  Unheard of 
Incompetent @RichLowry lost it tonight on @FoxNews  He should not be allowed on TV and the FCC should fine him 

 @FoxNews has been treating me very unfairly & I have therefore decided that I won't be doing any more Fox shows for the foreseeable future  

Headline reads Rubio passes Bush in Florida poll Unfair  because Trump destroys them both Trump 31 5%  Rubio 19 2%  Bush 11 3% 
 @JuliInkster Congratulations on your great win what a captain  what a champion 


I will be the featured guest on the season opener of @60Minutes this Sunday  There certainly is plenty to talk about 
Just remember  the birther movement was started by Hillary Clinton in 2008  She was all in 
I think @megynkelly should take another eleven day unscheduled vacation  
Do you ever notice that lightweight @megynkelly constantly goes after me but when I hit back it is totally sexist  She is highly overrated 
Senator Marco amnesty Rubio  who has worst voting record in Senate  just hit me on national security but I said don't go into Iraq  VISION 
I will be on the @colbertlateshow tonight at 11:30pic twitter com/BnCG1XqvcW

@JimClarkFarrier: @Rockprincess818 @LeahR77 @realDonaldTrump is the only one who can get us out of this mess True 
@glendabelle_11: @FoxNews Fox has become a supporter of Liberals They are Not supporting the GOP candidates especially Trump Quit watching 
@EdwardChelednik: @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Hey Donald your not alone  I can't watch it at all  Used to be all i watched  
@bobby990r_1: @MediaBiasAlert @megynkelly @realDonaldTrump is fighting for middle class and veterans Discussing trade deals  
@VickyBrush: Do what most of us are doing Turn off @FoxNews There is a major boycott going on with them  anyway  Problem solved 
@wallen_jeanine: @realDonaldTrump I can only watch Hannity  I think he is the only one in your corner

@TheMindWave: @FoxNews Im not sure why u r giving them this much importance  they had wanted to take u down in debate and they failed 
@joeoh89: @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump What happened to The Pledge  Walker quits and slams Trump  Losers proving Pledge was sham  
@PhyllisA: @Hopeisalive66 @jdanielmoore @theblaze @megynkelly @realDonaldTrump that's ok The more they talk the better POTUS Trump looks 
@waynearmstron10: @realDonaldTrump you must be relentless and maintain energy  and respond as you have been  It's a marathon  True  
@ellenEspence: @marklevinshow Thank you for maintaining your integrity during this disgusting lynching of @realDonaldTrump Thanks Mark 
 @RichLowry is truly one of the dumbest of the talking heads he doesn't have a clue 
I am having a really hard time watching @FoxNews  
@john_dipaolo: @realDonaldTrump will get out disaffected Repub base voters as well as Democrats looking for a real choice on immigration  
@diannrr: @megynkelly Do you dream about @realDonaldTrump  He's in your head  Let it go  She is the worst all anti Trump Terrible show  
@Rbbrkhd: @realDonaldTrump @oreillyfactor @FoxNews The way you have treated @realDonaldTrump is totally unacceptable   CNN has been fair 
@blewthebigone: @realDonaldTrump Can't even think what the race would be without you in it  
@tammyhorne19: @realDonaldTrump @oreillyfactor love you trump 
@coolgirl6978: @oreillyfactor @FoxNews this is bull fox  O'Reilly  I expect better from you  What is going on  Fair and balanced my ass 
@bewhatjesuswas: @oreillyfactor @FoxNews You dominate not because of them but despite them;They need you more than you need them 
@Patrick92299179: @realDonaldTrump @oreillyfactor Couldn't agree more 
@RagingCynicism: @realDonaldTrump @oreillyfactor they're not Trump haters  They're spoon fed morons  
 @oreillyfactor  why don't you have some knowledgeable talking heads on your show for a change instead of the same old Trump haters  Boring 
 @oreillyfactor was very negative to me in refusing to to post the great polls that came out today including NBC  @FoxNews not good for me 
@alivelutheran: @TODAYshow touts CNN polls instead of their own Of course  the NBC one shows him much higher  Trump corrects them 


I got to know @ScottWalker well—he’s a very nice person and has a great future

@TheBrodyFile: On the Muslim issue: It might help @BarackObama if he actually supported Christians religious liberty rights  
@TheBrodyFile: On the Muslim issue: It might help @BarackObama if he didn't take five years to visit Israel 
@TheBrodyFile: On the Muslim issue: It might help @BarackObama if he actually didn't come across as hostile to evangelicals in this country 
@PaulkDebra: @TODAYshow @realDonaldTrump I totally support you You have this Ga  Girl's vote 

The @TODAYshow refused to use their just in poll numbers where I have a massive lead but instead used @CNN numbers where my lead is smaller  
Will be on @foxandfriends now  Enjoy 
@SaijoSaijo75: @realDonaldTrump thank you for your personal and financial sacrifices to make america great again 
Carly Fiorina did such a horrible job at Lucent and HP  virtually destroying both companies  that she never got another CEO job offer Pres  
We are going to WIN and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN  maybe better than ever before 
I am attracting the biggest crowds  by far  and the best poll numbers  also by far  Much of the media is totally dishonest  So sad 
I have been leading big in all polls  with two more today  @nbc and @CNN  The NBC poll is more than double next  at 29%  Fiorina has 11%  
There is no way that Carly Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems  Boxer killed her for Senate in California 
I will be on @meetthepress at 10:30  @nbc will be releasing their new poll numbers  Based on the debate results  I should do well who knows  





On my way to Iowa  Will be landing in Des Moines in two hours  See ya 
Christians need support in our country (and around the world)  their religious liberty is at stake Obama has been horrible  I will be great 
If I would have challenged the man  the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech  A no win situation 
If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president  do you really think he would come to my rescue  No chance 
This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something  
Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him  I don't think so

@skulls2001: We are a Cuban family from Miami Florida and would love very much to work on your political campaing here in Miami  Great

Just finished the wonderful event on the U S S  Iowa  VETERANS FOR A STRONG AMERICA endorsed me  Such a great honor  thank you 
 @rushlimbaugh Rush  I am in LA inspecting property (big job creator) & listening to you  You are truly fantastic thanks 
The polls are really looking good—#1 everywhere despite all lobbyist & special interest $ being spent against me  I’m turning down millions  
Everyone is talking about the incredible event we had in Dallas last night  Spectacular crowd & arena Thank you @mcuban  
 @club4growth asked me for $1 million  I said no  Now falsely advertising that I will raise taxes  I’ll lower big league for middle class  
My plan will lower taxes for our country  not raise them  Phony @club4growth says I will raise taxes—just another lie  
Little respected Club For Growth asked me for $1 000 000 I said NO   Now they are spending lobbyist and special interest money on ads 
Am now in L A  Will be going to the U S S  IOWA at 5:30 P M  to speak to our great VETERANS and other friends 
Our vets are treated like 3rd class citizens  Enough Join me & @V4SA on @USSIOWA at LA Waterfront to hear my plan for vets & the military 
Loved Dallas and the tremendous crowd last night  Will be back 
I will rebuild the military  take care of vets and make the world respect the US again Join me today  Info:http://www vetstickets com

@Doctr__Wang @CNN Nice I love how Trump has a way of putting people on the spot  I wonder what CNN will do  The Veterans appreciate it 
Why is someone like George Pataki  who did a terrible job as Governor of N Y  and registers ZERO in the polls  allowed on the debate stage  




@DaveInKeno: Mr  Trump  Sir  this country is  and has been  on a path of self destruction and needs you to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
@joeearle: @Pistol044 There's only one I'll never support: @realDonaldTrump 
@Edward1:Trump Knows how to get things done  He has guts to say what needs to be said  He'll deal with Putin more effectively than anyone  


I am having a great time in Iowa at Jack Trice Stadium Unbelievable people  
Too many people on stage for debate  @RandPaul at 11th  with 2% in @RealClearNews  shouldn't be allowed to participate  
I truly understood the appeal of Ron Paul  but his son  @RandPaul  didn't get the right gene  
Lightweight Senator @RandPaul should focus on trying to get elected in Kentucky a great state which is embarrassed by him

@joehos18: Trump 96% success rate in business  only 4 out of 100 companies went south  Better than any other candidate  Better than all 
@ColinCavall: You were a great sport on the show and I have total confidence in you rebuilding this country and making America great again  
@Trump_in_2016: @realDonaldTrump does best imitation of himself we got ourselves a winner ready to hang on for the long haul  
@DanielleBoussel: I fully believe in apologies but you have to be wrong @realDonaldTrump 
@MlSSTHOT: @realDonaldTrump I want our president to be smart AND witty like you Mr Trump Thanks  

@ravila30:Loved you on Jimmy lastnight & how you showed you like to have fun/are able to laugh at yourself Do you ever sleep tho  Not much 

@TrumpDemocrats: Carson on @CNN now  He is worse than Jeb; like ambien for insomnia  We need energy in the White House  We need DonaldTrump 
@JohnnnnyT: @realDonaldTrump blew it away on @FallonTonight  The ratings will be HUUUGE  

@iamapatsfan: What are your thoughts on your good friend Tom Brady's performance yesterday  He was fantastic  a total winner 
@5SOS_jrt1d: Mr  Trump  you weren't just HUGE on @FallonTonight you were AWESOME  WISDOM and HUMOR ARE A POWERFUL COMBINATION 
@KittenHoliday: At the neighborhood bar talking about @realDonaldTrump we need him We will make America great again

@Chrisofficer23: @realDonaldTrump @jenilynn1001 @FallonTonight loved the show    trump2016 
@DesignerDeb3: @realDonaldTrump is the only candidate against illegals  We will have America back & jobs 

@GinHay: Trump's polls are going to skyrocket after appearance on @jimmyfallon tonight  The young people are going to love him 

The Tonight Show @nbc will be amazing 11:30 P M  ENJOY 
Amazing crowd outside @FallonTonight  Tune in tonight at 11:30 pic twitter com/4dxoEV0wia 
 @GovernorPerry is a terrific guy and I wish him well I know he will have a great future 
On @FallonTonight with @jimmyfallon at 11:30 PM  Enjoy 

 @robertjeffress I greatly appreciate your kind words last night on @FoxNews  Have great love for the evangelicals great respect for you  
Just purchased NBC’s half of The Miss Universe Organization and settled all lawsuits against them  Now own 100% stay tuned 
Let’s all take a moment to remember all of the heroes from a very tragic day that we cannot let happen again 
Oh wow  lightweight Governor @BobbyJindal  who is registered at less than 1 percent in the polls  just mocked my hair  So original 
Also  tomorrow night I will be going to Boone and Ames  Really look forward to seeing all of my friends in Iowa  

I will be on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon tonight at 11:30  Should be fun @jimmyfallon 
     I only respond to people that register more than 1% in the polls  I never thought he had a chance and I’ve been proven right  
Bobby Jindal did not make the debate stage and therefore I have never met him…  

I'll be on @greta ON THE RECORD tonight at 7 PM 
Wow  I am ahead of the field with Evangelicals (am so proud of this) and virtually every other group  and Ben Carson just took a swipe at me 
I had a great day in D C  even though the subject was an unpleasant one  the horrible Iran Nuke deal  Amazing crowd and enthusiasm 
Man did JEB throw his brother under the bus last night on @colbertlateshow   Probably true  but not nice 


See you in D C  tomorrow at 1:00 P M  at the Capitol to protest the horribly negotiated deal with Iran  Really sad 

@christa_dorsett: @realDonaldTrump we want Trump America needs him desperately 
@Chris0u24: @realDonaldTrump I've just lost hope Mr Trump  Hope you put America back the way it was 

Will be on Bill O'Reilly @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 PM  Enjoy 
A great honor to receive polling numbers like these  Record setting African American (25%) & Hispanic numbers (31%) http://www theamericanmirror com/shock poll trump receives 25 of black vote in general election matchup/ … 

Jeb’s policies in Florida helped lead to its almost total collapse  Right after he left he went to work for Lehman Brothers—wow 
The lobbyists & special interests have just put out an ad for Jeb which hits me just a little but is very false 
I’m self funding my campaign but lobbyists & special interests for Jeb & others are starting to do big ads—desperate Don’t believe them  

Thank you @IngrahamAngle for your strength & wonderful words last night on @FoxNews  but @KarlRove is easy to beat 
Wow Such nice words from Robert Redford on my running for President  Thank you  Robert pic twitter com/TpV3w18BW6 
Tomorrow in DC: 1 PM West Front Lawn of the Capitol  Not even believable that we would do this deal with Iran  
Look forward to being in DC tomorrow—big crowd expected for our protest against the truly stupid nuclear deal we are making with Iran  
Looking forward to being with @SenTedCruz at our big rally in D C  on Wednesday (1:00 P M  at the Capitol) to protest insane Iran nuke deal 
Both Washington D C  and DALLAS are turning out to be really big events  D C  is protest of incompetent Iran deal and Dallas is big speech 
Remember  I'll see you in D C  at the Capitol Building on Wednesday at 1:00 o'clock  Then Dallas on Sept 14 at 6:00 P M  American Air Center 
@Douglasmaher: @realDonaldTrump @TIMENOUT @surveyusa Looking forward to seeing you in Dallas and voting for you  Great 
@georgeokc: @realDonaldTrump @libertyladyusa For my mind  do whatever you think is right  you have nothing to prove  just save our nation  
@maddog71075: @realDonaldTrump America needs you as the President to bring America back to letting Christians believe So true 
@saneplanet: @toddwmoore01 @realDonaldTrump I know  Gives in secret without even a writeoff  @greta spilled beans about 25k Thank you 
@MJosephSheppard: No other GOP candidate has potential to win Ohio & Pennsylvania thus the presidency  except jobs pres @realDonaldTrump 
Thank you @scottienhughes for your powerful words on @FoxNews  I am with the Evangelicals and Tea Party big time  We will all WIN together 

@MJosephSheppard: No other GOP candidate has potential to win Ohio & Pennsylvania thus the presidency except jobs @realDonaldTrump  
@kylesteckel: @club4growth @realDonaldTrump The letter is out  liars  
@afievoli: @realDonaldTrump We need a strong leader to fix the mess our country in Go Mr Trump 
@rnull65: I am 72 year old female  You give me hope 1st time in years America can come back  stay the course we need you in 2016 
@jimlibertarian: @SlwStdySque Donald has already done many great things he has woke America up and people are screaming Donald everywhere 
@soz58: @realDonaldTrump @BOB_EWASHINGTON @club4growth it's good to show the public such things a lot of nerve to ask for a million dollars 

@SeanBolza: Sure hope you will do great things  You are giving us something to look forward to  and make America great again  Go Trump 
@jackson3pack: @realDonaldTrump @BOB_EWASHINGTON @club4growth Wow  So disengenuos in asking for a million dollars Like its no big deal  
@boobdex: @realDonaldTrump @BOB_EWASHINGTON @club4growth wow I didn't know it was that unprofessional  

@broewads: @realDonaldTrump @club4growth They are all just phony cronies  Keep up the Real Deal Mr  TRUMP YOU ARE THE MAN  
@1ns1de_J9b: @realDonaldTrump @club4growth Borderline extortion scam  They would have used your $1M to extract donations from others 
@DeanAllen12: @club4growth Club4Growth will do anything for a handout just like every other POLITICIAN running    Pay to Say organization 


@cadigirl13: @realdonaldtrump You are our only hope Keep strong Mr Trump Thank you  
 @club4growth should release the letter they sent me asking for $1 000 000  When I said no  they came out against me  A scam operation  
@jasonusmc2017: @blayne_troy @realDonaldTrump: He was right when he called Obama the 5 for 1 president  5 terrorist for one no good traitor 

@SamSteel10: @shook_stephanie @slone as long as we can stay strong and give @realDonaldTrump our support  He's the leader  
I will be in Washington D C  on Wednesday 1 P M  in front of the Capitol  to protest the horrible and incompetent deal being made with Iran  
The Dallas event on September 14 at 6:00 P M  at the American Airlines Center looks like it will be a giant success  Tickets are going FAST 
Our country needs a president with great leadership skills and vision  not someone like Hillary or Barack  neither of which has a clue 
The phony Club For Growth  which asked me in writing for $1 000 000 (I said no)  is now wanting to do negative ads on me  Total hypocrites 





The hedge fund guys (gals) have to pay higher taxes ASAP  They are paying practically nothing  We must reduce taxes for the middle class 
By self funding my campaign  I am not controlled by my donors  special interests or lobbyists  I am only working for the people of the U S  
Remember that I am self funding my campaign  Hillary  Jeb and the rest are spending special interest and lobbyist money 100% CONTROLLED 
Hillary said such nasty things about me  read directly off her teleprompter   but there was no emotion  no truth  Just can't read speeches 
Hillary Clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter I have ever seen  In fact  it wasn't even see through glass  it was black 
Saudi Arabia was vehemently against the Iran nuclear deal  Then today they embraced it  What happened  What did we give them to endorse  
Wow  the Dallas event in two weeks looks like a big winner Get your tickets (American Airlines Center) FAST 
Just announced that because of Trump   advertising rates for debate on @CNN are going from $5000 to $200 000  a 4000% increase PAY CHARITY  
Why would a very low ratings radio talk show host like Hugh Hewitt be doing the next debate on @CNN  He is just a 3rd rate gotcha guy 
Very low ratings radio host Hugh Hewitt asked me about Suleiman  Abu Bake al Baghdad  Hassan Nasrallah and more typical gotcha questions 
The Dallas event in two weeks  at the American Airlines Center  is filling up fast  Get your tickets fast  before it is too late 
 @MeghanMcCain was terrible on @TheFive yesterday  Angry and obnoxious  she will never make it on T V  @FoxNews can do so much better 

So nice  thank you Laura https://twitter com/IngrahamAngle/status/639797662427017216 … 
Daily Caller: Trump Surpasses Field  Flirts With 40 Percent in Alabama Pollhttp://dailycaller com/2015/09/03/exclusive trump surpasses field flirts with 40 percent in alabama poll/ … 

Will be on @Morning_Joe in 5 minutes at 7:00  Enjoy 


@linnie13: @greta @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I love Donald Trump  For ONCE I feel like someone out there running actually cares about us  


Congratulations to Tom Brady on yet another great victory Tom is my friend and a total winner 
The deal with Iran will go down as one of the most incompetent ever made  The U S  lost on virtually every point  We just don't win anymore 

 @brithume  I am in first place by a lot in all polls  tied for first place with Ben Carson in one Iowa poll  I thought you knew this thanks 


 @kevinolearytv Great job on @foxandfriends this morning  You tell it like it is Also  thx for the nice mention  Your book sounds great 


Will be interviewed on @GMA this morning at 7:00  Thanks for the GREAT poll results 


@LBabcock2: @oreillyfactor @FoxNews I have always wondered why Fox kept Rove on after his disastrous election predictions  He is a joke 
@gulfportedd: @realDonaldTrump Jeb bush couldn't shine MR trumps shoes   give me a break  Bushes are so over    

When I intelligently turned down The Club For Growth crazy request for $1 000 000  they got nasty What a waste of money that would have been 
The president of the pathetic Club For Growth came to my office in N Y C  and asked for a ridiculous $1 000 000 contribution  I said no way 


Every Poll has me winning BIG If you listen to dopey Karl Rove  a Trump hater  on @oreillyfactor  you would think I'm doing poorly  @FoxNews 
Why does @oreillyfactor and @FoxNews always have Karl Rove on  He spent $430 million and lost ALL races  A dope who said Romney won election 
I’m turning down millions of dollars of campaign contributions—feel totally stupid doing so  but hope it is appreciated by the voters  
Many Super Pacs  funded by groups that want total control over their candidate  are being formed to “attack” Trump  Remember when u see them 

Congrats everyone we topped 4 million today on Twitter and heading up fast 
While millions are being spent against me in attack ads  they are paid for by the “bosses” and “owners” of candidates  I am self funding  
Jeb is spending millions of dollars on “hit” ads funded by lobbyists & special interests  Bad system  
Yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign  Will Jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me  

The just released Public Policy Polling (PPP national result) is the best yet  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
@highwayhopper66: @ConnieMackIV @00patriot My wife and I are both voting for trump in florida over our previous governor PERIOD Thank you 

Just out new PPP NATIONAL POLL has me in first place by a wide margin at 29%  I wonder why only @FoxNews has not reported this  Too bad 
150 Clinton E mails still contain classified information  More sensitive when she was Sec of State  This is a very big deal  
President Obama wants to change the name of Mt  McKinley to Denali after more than 100 years  Great insult to Ohio  I will change back 
Very proud of Trump Int'l Golf Links in Aberdeen  Scotland  Just got the five star award from @VisitScotNewshttps://twitter com/VisitScotNews/status/636834419270139904 … 


For those that don’t think a wall (fence) works  why don’t they suggest taking down the fence around the White House  Foolish people 
Huma Abedin  the top aide to Hillary Clinton and the wife of perv sleazebag Anthony Wiener  was a major security risk as a collector of info 
@nodramahea: @realDonaldTrump Gaining more supporters every day  People want change  Trump2016 
Leading in the Bloomberg Iowa poll  Also  my favorability numbers went up at a record  almost unheard of  clip  Thank you Iowa 
Loved being with my many friends in Tennessee  The crowd and enthusiasm was fantastic  I won the straw poll big 



Wow  Jeb Bush just lost three of his top fundraisers they quit 
Leaving now for Tennessee  Big crowd 
Great rally last night in Massachusetts  2000 people at a house must be a record Unbelievable spirit to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN  

Will be interviewed by @SarahPalinUSA tonight at 10:00 on OAN Network  Enjoy 
@TDarbyMitchell: I love you Donald Trump I've never liked politics before u came on the scene but I finally feel like there's hope for USA 
@NancyLLeonard: Love 'em or hate 'em @realDonaldTrump is changing the playing field  finally  Our country needed this wake up call

Will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 7:00 A M  So much to talk about 
The crowd in South Carolina was amazing  We set records and had a great time  Will be back soon  
Who wants the endorsement of a guy (@EricCantor) who lost in perhaps the greatest upset in the history of Congress  
 @BenFergusonShow just watched you on @CNN  Thank you for your nice comments

@CodyShirk @genemarks @Entrepreneur @realDonaldTrump Because he speaks & acts like a real person; not like a slimy  calculated politician

Another good poll result in the great state of SC  Trump at 30%  Carson at 15% and Bush at 9% http://politicalwire com/2015/08/25/trump holds big lead in south carolina/ … 
Congrats @LindseyGrahamSC  You just got 4 points in your home state of SC—far better than zero nationally  You’re only 26 pts behind me  
@linda_lcarson: @realDonaldTrump Rubio and Bush cant say Wall  I guess it is not pc  Just like obama cant say islamic terrorists 
@ASA_Patriot: @realDonaldTrump @PatrickStinard @megynkelly I could not agree more I now flip to other channels at 9:00pm 
@RageFelix: @GovernorPataki     I LIVED IN NY WHEN TACKY PATAKI WAS GOV    HE WAS A TOTAL DISASTER FOR THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK 
@Dlund22226523: Gov  Scott Walker has ran Wisconsin's economy into the ground  How dare he criticize you  You would fire him in a second  
@ibemoshing: No hope for Jeb Bush anymore  @realDonaldTrump has been on fire Really hope he can get the win and fix this country 
 @GovernorPataki did a terrible job as Governor of New York  If he ran again  he would have lost in a landslide  He and Graham ZERO in polls 
Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a fence  It's not a fence  Jeb  it's a WALL  and there's a BIG difference 
Asians are very offended that JEB said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics  A mess 
In a clumsy move to get out of his anchor babies dilemma  where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it  he blamed ASIANS 
Jeb Bush never uses his last name on advertising  signage  materials etc  Is he ashamed of the name BUSH  A pretty sad situation  Go Jeb 
@PatrickStinard: @megynkelly Kelly File was much better without Megyn Kelly  Her replacement while she was out on vacation was much better 
@YoungYoung54: @JeriHyatt @megynkelly @JebBush So true  Jeb Bush is crazy  who cares that he speaks Mexican  this is America  English 
@Barbavh: @realDonaldTrump @megynkelly Ordered my Trump banner today  Can't wait 

@AdriannaMarie: @realDonaldTrump People always take cheap shots at you they can't handle the truth You tell it like it is They're cowards  
@jdwarren12: @realDonaldTrump Mr Trump I appreciate you and your honesty sir Thank you  
@toneantone96: @realDonaldTrump No man or women on this Planet can give us back America with the exception of @realDonaldTrump Leadership 

@mstanish53: @realDonaldTrump @megynkelly The bimbo back in town   I hope not for long   
@MikeRaj7: @megynkelly Show has become a opinion show  Leading questions  Stirrwalt and Thiessen  used  Fair and balanced  NOT 
@swamp_bug: @seanhannity Cruz is my second/third choice  Carson is also a good man  I look at it as war  so my choice is TRUMP  
@bigpaulfla: @realDonaldTrump She has come back looking like Nancy Grace 
@ColeHudson68: @megynkelly @FoxNews @theBlaze @greta @OreillyFactor Megyn needs to go back on vacation  What a waste of an hour on Fox  
I liked The Kelly File much better without @megynkelly  Perhaps she could take another eleven day unscheduled vacation 
 @megynkelly must have had a terrible vacation  she is really off her game  Was afraid to confront Dr  Cornel West  No clue on immigration 
@JeriHyatt: @megynkelly @JebBush @realDonaldTrump Pffffffttttt we need to do something about illegals who get more than our vets

@glendabelle_11 @FoxNewsInsider @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Trump supporters volunteer  contribute  assist campaign etc  We need Trump 
@ZephyrusMatrix: Will you finally get respect for predicting U S  concerns even weeks before disaster strikes The country needs a visionary 
Markets are crashing all caused by poor planning and allowing China and Asia to dictate the agenda  This could get very messy Vote Trump  

As I have long stated  we are so tied in with China and Asia that their markets are now taking the U S  market down  Get smart U S A  
New Reuters Poll just came out and has me at 32%  highest number yet The silent majority is back and we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
The last thing we need is another Bush in the White House  Would be the same old thing (remember read my lips  no more taxes )  GREATNESS 
Jeb Bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body  Jeb just can't get it right 
Jeb Bush is weak on illegal immigration  in favor of common core  bad on women's health issues and thinks the Iraq war was a good thing  
Now that I started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border  most other candidates are finally speaking up  Just politicians 

How is Bernie Sanders going to defend our country if he can't even defend his own microphone  Very sad 
Thank you to the @washingtonpost for the accurate and very discriptive story on my speech in Alabama last night  It was a great evening 
I had 15 000 people in Phoenix but @politico said the rooms capacity is just over 2000  But said Bernie Sanders had 11 000 in same room  
 @politico covers me more inaccurately than any other media source  and that is saying something  They go out of their way to distort truth 
@dojiedojie: @realDonaldTrump Keep talking Donald    The people want to hear it loud and clear 

Alabama was great last night  amazing people  30 000 folks was largest crowd of political season  Nice 
 @jessebwatters  You did a great job hosting @oreillyfactor  Everybody loved it Thank you for the nice words  

Dow dives more than 500 points down 9% from high  Be careful 
Leaving for Mobile  Alabama  right now can't be late 
Boston incident is terrible  We need energy and passion  but we must treat each other with respect  I would never condone violence  



How crazy 7 5% of all births in U S  are to illegal immigrants  over 300 000 babies per year  This must stop  Unaffordable and not right 
Jeb Bush signed memo saying not to use the term anchor babies  offensive  Now he wants to use it because I use it  Stay true to yourself 
Alabama will shine tomorrow  It will be a big and glorious day 
We are going to make our country so strong again  so great again  No more ripping off the United States  We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
@2ndVoter: @SteveHuang68 agree  One of the things that is good abt @realDonaldTrump is he's forcing others out of status quo politicking  
@MattyJack33: @TomLlamasABC So refreshing to have someone call out these left wingers posing as journalists  Keep it up Trump 
 @WNTonight please correct your story tonight  The public is fed up with bad reporting for the sake of sensationalizing something 
 @TomLlamasABC cannot report the news truthfully  Why not apologize for your fraudulent story on World News Tonight Gang members & criminals 
@ABCPolitics must apologize  My statement we're going to get them out so fast  so quick applied to hard core criminals & gang members  LIE

@JoeWeissnmb @realDonaldTrump @MichaelCohen212 Walker & Bush want to be like Trump  My Mom88 They sound like boys compared to Trump  

If I am elected President I will immediately approve the Keystone XL pipeline  No impact on environment & lots of jobs for U S  
@JohnBerman Two explanations on @realDonaldTrump that seem no longer sufficient: 1) It's early  2) It is all a media creation  
 @jasondhorowitz I am very proud of my sister  your story was terrific  Thank you so much  

When foreigners attend our great colleges & want to stay in the U S   they should not be thrown out of our country  
I want talented people to come into this country—to work hard and to become citizens  Silicon Valley needs engineers  etc  


Listening to @rushlimbaugh on way back to Jury Duty  Fantastic show  terrific guy 
Why does @FoxNews keep George Will as a talking head  Wrong on so many subjects 
@RuizSeferino: @paulfincher2 Please have mercy on all Veterans  All we wished to do is serve a county who serves us not  Trump for Pres 
@NobamaDotCom: An FYI to all the DonaldTrump haters: We've won  Most admit TRUMP CAN WIN  And @GeorgeWill & @krauthammer watch and learn 
@BannermanJack: Rush is on fire today He really does have his finger on the pulse  The @realDonaldTrump shamers can't win against El Rushbo 
@paulfincher2: I truly believe @realDonaldTrump is America's best choice to get our economy back on course & create needed jobs  

@laura_winkker: @realDonaldTrump And its funny how Fox News doesn't really get it love you Mr  Trump 
@1776Pirate: @LindseyGrahamSC @WashTimes @madisongesiotto agreed  We need @realDonaldTrump as president ASAP  

@KNDetweiler: @hrkbenowen @thetimes @realDonaldTrump just released immigration plan is superior to everyone else's  Including Cruz  

I really enjoyed being at the Iowa State Fair  The crowds  love and enthusiasm is something I will never forget  
 @NicolleDWallace Your father is a brilliant man with wonderful sense therefore  you must be good 

@javonniandjeno: @realDonaldTrump @AP @nbc Donald Trump is Clint Eastwood  the perfect hero not scared of American terrorists  Vote Trump 
Just got back from the Iowa State Fair  Record crowds  phenomenal people  Thank you IOWA  I will never let you down 

In the plane heading to Iowa State Fair  Will be great fun  Hopefully giving helicopter rides to some of the kids  
Making speech tonight in New Hampshire leaving now  Fantastic people  fantastic crowd 
 @AP and @HuffingtonPost should change their fraudulent story to say THAT I DROPPED @NBC & The Apprentice to run for President 
People don’t understand that I left The Apprentice to run for Pres—the Apprentice DID NOT leave me  Bob Greenblatt & folks @NBC were GREAT 






@mikerotondo86 Only Trump can bring us back from 20 Trillion in debt    He's the only one with the experience and skill set to do so  
Will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight for the full hour  Hope you enjoy it and  more importantly  hope you agree 

@pokeyisme1971: @realDonaldTrump @ericbolling @oreillyfactor why are people scared of someone who wants to fix a broken system trump 2016 

 @SenTedCruz had a very good debate  far better than Rand Paul  
 @ericbolling you can do much better than you did tonight on @oreillyfactor  Better luck tomorrow 
Why is @RandPaul allowed to take advantage of the people of Kentucky by running for Senator and Pres  Why should Kentucky be back up plan  
We must stop the crime and killing machine that is illegal immigration  Rampant problems will only get worse  Take back our country 

@Roy_Propsner: @realDonaldTrump    Don't give up  don't surrender your 3rd party OPTION 
Truly weird Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky reminds me of a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain  He was terrible at DEBATE 
Again  illegal immigrant is charged with the fatal bludgeoning of a wonderful and loved 64 year old woman  Get them out and build a WALL 
 @KatrinaCampins Thank you so much for the wonderful statements you made about me on TV  Also  keep up the great work 
 @BrandenRoderick I was pleased to see the wonderful statements you made about me to the media I'm not surprised  you're a special person 
 @OMAROSA You were fantastic on television this weekend  Thank you so much – you are a loyal friend 


Roger Ailes just called  He is a great guy & assures me that “Trump” will be treated fairly on @FoxNews  His word is always good 

 @KathieLGifford  Melania and I send our deepest condolences  Frank was a special and amazing person  He will be missed by all

@Libsaredemfools: @realDonaldTrump: No one knows more about business and the economy than you  You are what's right for America 
Wonderful Frank Gifford has just passed away at age 84  He was my friend and a truly great guy Warmest condolences to family  
It amazes me that other networks seem to treat me so much better than @FoxNews  I brought them the biggest ratings in history  & I get zip 
I just realized that if you listen to Carly Fiorina for more than ten minutes straight  you develop a massive headache  She has zero chance 
@strayamaaaate: DonaldTrump shaking things up in US elections  Jeb Bush is really weak  Carly Fiorina shud go back to HP 

@WWDBLane: @realDonaldTrump Nice try Jeb  my wife agrees with Trump over Megyn  

@CommissarOfGG: You are being attacked from all sides  yet you have the people's hearts  Just be calm and trust yourself  We love you  

@nonstop85716: @thetrumpmafia @realDonaldTrump I agree  I registered to vote because of Mr Trump I will vote for him  
@george_frye: @realDonaldTrump Finally a candidate that speaks on behalf of the people and not on behalf of the government  Go Donald 
@liexafterxlie: @realDonaldTrump @RedState Yep  I was there and people were leaving left and right  @EWErickson blew it BIG TIME 

Small crowds at @RedState today in Atlanta  People were very angry at EWErickson  a major sleaze and buffoon who has saved me time and money 
Almost universal support that Trump won the debate  Only @FoxNews is consistantly fighting the Trump win  and I got them the ratings 
Wow  CNN just said that Donald Trump won the DEBATE  connected best with audience  Also  Time  Drudge  Newsmax  N Y Times and more 
 @redstate I miss you all  and thanks for all of your support  Political correctness is killing our country  weakness  
Re Megyn Kelly quote: you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes  blood coming out of her wherever (NOSE)  Just got on w/thought 
So many politically correct fools in our country  We have to all get back to work and stop wasting time and energy on nonsense 



@John832TheTruth: @FrankLuntz your focus groups are rigged and your company ran out of $ in 2011  KEEP SPEAKING THE TRUTH TRUMP 2016 ♡ 
The hatred that clown @krauthammer has for me is unbelievable – causes him to lie when many others say Trump easily won debate  
    Dopey @krauthammer should be fired  @FoxNews 
 @FoxNews you should be ashamed of yourself  I got you the highest debate ratings in your history & you say nothing but bad    


@ElvisFever: @megynkelly @FoxNews Out to get you with baited questions  She was angry at you  Very hostile and unprofessional 
@GotMade: @realDonaldTrump Great Job Winning the debate last night will take over half the field out  @FoxNews was not fair to Trump 
@TIME poll: @realDonaldTrump winner of last night's debate by wide margin   45% v 12% @RealBenCarson  10% @JohnKasichhttp://ti me/1IRqVp2  
@CaptTimScrim: Dear @megynkelly   your attempted hatchet job on @realDonaldTrump was unbecoming & a total failure  @FoxNews 
@StefanVersac: @megynkelly @ChrisStirewalt @ChrisChristie @realDonaldTrump Rosie O'Donnell was the best answer of that whole debate 
@Southern_Anon63: I am a stone cold down to the bone democrat  But I will be voting @realDonaldTrump on Election Day  
@joshuapantoja: @megynkelly @FrankLuntz @realDonaldTrump you tried to attack Trump  he took it and smiled  Trump will be the next president 

@Sulli1963: @AnnCoulter final four Trump  Cruz  Walker  Carson wild card Fiorina

@Mannamalistic: I'm s lifelong liberal and have come to fucking love @realDonaldTrump  He speaks the truth 
@Diplomt: @realDonaldTrump is in a greater position w/ 52% to 12% @Drudge_Report even after @MegynKelly & @BretBaier tried to take him out  

@BrianCraigShow: @realDonaldTrump your rocked & won BIG TIME Make America Great Again Mr  Trump 
@agcaddauan: @realDonaldTrump @DRUDGE_REPORT Megyn could have done a far better job* 
@Diplomtc_Immnty: @realDonaldTrump They tried to take you out & your poll numbers skyrocketed  Voters matter  not @FOXNews moderators  
@Reid2962: @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I expected better from @megynkelly  wondering what is her hidden agenda  
@Resi_Diederich: @PlatinumRosie @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @megynkelly is that all you've got    Haha  
@JetRanger69: @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @megynkelly @BretBaier WAS A DISASTER ALSO  
@Lking2fly: I gotta have @realDonaldTrump in the White House that'd be such a game changer 

I really enjoyed the debate tonight even though the @FoxNews trio  especially @megynkelly  was not very good or professional 
 @FrankLuntz  your so called focus groups are a total joke  Don't come to my office looking for business again  You are a clown 
Wow  @megynkelly really bombed tonight  People are going wild on twitter Funny to watch  
 @FrankLuntz I won every poll of the debate tonight by massive margins @DRUDGE_REPORT & @TIME so where did you find that dumb panel  

 @FrankLuntz is a low class slob who came to my office looking for consulting work and I had zero interest  Now he picks anti Trump panels 
@timjcam: @megynkelly @FrankLuntz @realDonaldTrump Fox viewers give low marks to bimbo @MegynKelly will consider other programs 
@RubenMMoreno: @realDonaldTrump The biggest loser in the debate was @megynkelly  You can't out trump Donald Trump  You will lose 







I look forward to tonight's debate but look far more forward to making America great again  It can happen 
 @realbobmassi  who does a show called Bob Massi Is The Property Man on @FoxNews  really knows his stuff a total pro

@InsureRetire @realDonaldTrump @Gawker best response ever Give Trump lemons and he will sell them back to you for a steep profit  
Do you notice that Hillary spews out Jeb's name as often as possible in order to give him status  She knows Trump is her worst nightmare  
Many of Hillary’s donors are the same donors as Jeb Bush’s—all rich  will have total control—know them well

 @DottieandBogey Thanks for nice comments over weekend re Turnberry  You and your husband have fantastic taste Also  great commentary  
Despite the false @nytimes story about Jeb Bush being happy with the Trump surge  he fell more than anybody & is miserable  
Wow  did the @nytimes fall into the Bush trap where his people convinced them how happy he was that I was hurting other candidates & not him 


@lynn_weiser: @realDonaldTrump @DanScavino @EricTrump @ericbolling It's a trailblazing campaign A campaign that connects to people 

Bush is pretending that the Trump surge is great for him and the @nytimesworld is reporting Bush delight con job  a Bush nightmare

@DavidBougs: @scorpio5053 @nowandthan @RealMarkCole Amen GOP elite called Reagan a cowboy  B movie actor  dangerous unelectable Trump 

@scorpio5053: @nowandthan @RealMarkCole @realDonaldTrump The GOP TREETED Reagan the same way  Until he beat em then turned into ass kissers 



I wish good luck to all of the Republican candidates that traveled to California to beg for money etc  from the Koch Brothers  Puppets  
Watch my interview with @ericbolling on @FoxNews today at 11:30AM ET 
@ColinSWood @realDonaldTrump is worth more than ALL of the other Presidential candidates combined and plenty more  
@blindtothetruth Trump is polling well because he speaks his mind  Not like some of the career politicians he's running against  Cowards  
@sjh2222 Difference Between Politicians and @realDonaldTrump = Pols Are Bought & Paid For  Trump Can't be Bought  Bullied or Bribed

I look forward to the debate on Thursday night & it is certainly my intention to be very nice & highly respectful of the other candidates  
Just at a news conference from Trump Turnberry in Scotland  Everybody was there & will be all over television tonite  Back on trail Saturday 
Carl Cameron @FoxNews is the only reporter I know who consistently fumbles & misrepresents poll results  He has been so wrong & he hates it 
@bdean1468 The alpha male in the 2016 race: @realDonaldTrump He has real success stories  tons of money  confident  & he's his own backer 
@lasannewton @realDonaldTrump The only candidate who will not owe favors to campaign contributors

Thank you https://twitter com/TomNocera/status/626293868233928705 … 
People like lawyer Elizabeth Beck and failed writer Harry Hurt & others talk about me but know nothing about me—crazy 
How can a dummy dope like Harry Hurt  who wrote a failed book about me but doesn’t know me or anything about me  be on TV discussing Trump  

    while Tom Brady is guilty because he REPLACED his LEGAL cellphone  
Per @rushlimbaugh: Why does Hillary Clinton get the benefit of the doubt (after she DESTROYS her illegal email server)     

@JereeGeeStavich @realDonaldTrump You are blowing everyone else away  Not just ahead  but doubling  Wow  

@TomNocera @DanScavino @dallasmavs @mcuban Trump's work ethic gives me hope he's a tireless and smart worker: a winner not a whiner  
I truly LOVE all of the millions of people who are sticking with me despite so many media lies  There is a great SILENT MAJORITY looming 
Thank you @Morning_Joe for throwing the pathetic reporter from the failing and money losing Daily Beast off the air  Really cool 
So many people who know nothing about me are commenting all over T V  and the media as though they have great D J T  insight  Know NOTHING 
 @CNN Why is somebody (Beck) I beat so soundly all of a sudden an expert on Donald Trump (all over television)  She knows nothing about me  
 CNN & @CNNPolitics Lawyer Elizabeth Beck did a terrible job against me  she lost (I even got legal fees)  I loved beating her she was easy 
Lawyer Elizabeth Beck was easy for me to beat  Ask her clients if they are happy with her results against me  Got total win and legal fees  
 @CNN & @CNNPolitics did not say that lawyer Beck lost the case and I got legal fees  Also  she wanted to breast pump in front of me at dep  
@jan102345678: @realDonaldTrump Mr Trump I am thrilled you are running for President of USA You are the only man for the job 



A nation WITHOUT BORDERS is not a nation at all  We must have a wall  The rule of law matters  Jeb just doesn’t get it  
While I’m beating my opponents in the polls  I’m also beating lobbyists  special interests & donors that are supporting them with billions

@Malibu101834: @realDonaldTrump @oreillyfactor I'll watch anything that gives you a chance to share your views  Go donald  

I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00  Will be talking about the poor treatment of our veterans  illegal immigration  etc  
Look how small the pages have become @WSJ  Looks like a tabloid—saving money I assume 
This story is no longer about John McCain  it’s about our horribly treated vets  Illegals are treated better than our wonderful veterans  
It was only after I informed NBC that I wouldn't do the Apprentice that they became upset w/ me  They couldn’t care less about “inclusion 
@amit_ @realdonaldtrump I agree 100%  McCain is fighting for illegal immigrant but never did anything for our Vets  
@LinFlies @GhostDancer_2 @contrarian11 @MichaelCohen212 @ChrisCuomo @DeptVetAffairs    rest of GOP only cries but Trump gets stuff DONE 
@Valenti317 @realDonaldTrump the left is petrified of you Why else would they be attacking you so vigorously  
@MJJustus1 @AndrewStilesUSA @realDonaldTrump Trump already hosts vets at his resorts  What does Hillary do  
@RTMatador Trump says things that no one else would even consider saying  I agree with him on the immigration situation  i love honesty 
@_EOD I believe we have passed that point  There are Homeless Veterans in USA & yet Illegal Aliens get Government Housing 

@VetApologist This is big criticism of the Republican field  Speak truth and stop being so PC  This is why @realDonaldTrump resonates 

We will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans  
The ever dwindling @WSJ which is worth about 1/10 of what it was purchased for  is always hitting me politically  Who cares 
@RW84JR: @realDonaldTrump Glad U R Man Enough 2 Speak the Truth in this Pathetic Politically Correct World

I will be making some very big campaign stops next week big crowds and tremendous energy MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
The Republican Party must get tougher and smarter  and fast  or it will go down to a very big defeat just like the last two times 
A true piece about the standing ovations I got yesterdayhttp://thegazette com/subject/news/government/politics/cruz jindal trump score big at family leader gop presidential candidate event 20150719 … 
The Veterans Administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly  John McCain has done nothing to help them but talk  
John McCain called thousands of people crazies when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in Phoenix  He owes apology 
@mwood_79: @SharylAttkisson Why do they attack Mr Trump  Because he has something they dont  The ability of truth Trump is here 
@dunn_cheri: @SharylAttkisson Mr Trump the only one telling the truth  Liberals can't stand the fact that your are leading in the poll 
@amsardina: @realDonaldTrump @SharylAttkisson kick there ass Trump 



One of the reasons I am no fan of John McCain is that our Vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians  I will fix VA quickly  

Why would anybody listen to @MittRomney  He lost an election that should have easily been won against Obama  By the way so did John McCain 
Congrats to the new Gov  of Texas  @GregAbbott_TX  for taking a tough & bold stance at the border  Should have been done long ago by Perry  
I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans  Veterans deserve universal access to care  VA scandal proves politicians are inept  
    that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care  
It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans      
I will make this right for our great Vets 
All he does is go on television is talk  talk  talk  but incapable of doing anything  
    John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives  
The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years    
Captured or not  all our soldiers are heroes 
In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets  John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President 
Just left Family Leadership Summit in Iowa  got a standing ovation from many wonderful people  I will be back soon  

I am now in Iowa getting ready to speak  People are always amazed to find out that I am Protestant (Presbyterian)  GREAT

 @McLaughlinGroup Greatly appreciate yr wonderful comments this weekend  People of “great accomplishment” should easily quality for prez  

@bdean1468 @jlangdale @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @CNN SAY IT LOUD & SAY IT PROUD WE WANT TRUMP 
When will people  and the media  start to apologize to me for my statement  Mexico is sending       which turned out to be true  El Chapo 
    likewise  billions of dollars gets brought into Mexico through the border  We get the killers  drugs & crime  they get the money 
El Chapo and the Mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a vacuum cleaner  sucking drugs and death right into the U S  
The U S  will invite El Chapo  the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison  to become a U S  citizen because our leaders can't say no 

     but that's what I've been saying  Very unfair treatment by the media 
Now that the Mexican drug lord escaped from prison  everyone is saying that most of the cocaine etc  coming into the U S  comes over border 
I hear that sleepy eyes @chucktodd will be fired like a dog from ratings starved Meet The Press  I can't imagine what is taking so long 
   Trump  however  would kick his ass 
Can you envision Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton negotiating with 'El Chapo'  the Mexican drug lord who escaped from prison       
Sleep eyes @ChuckTodd is killing Meet The Press  Isn't he pathetic  Love watching him fail

@ErinEdwards001 @realDonaldTrump thank you for telling it how it is  no one else will address these issues  You have my vote  


@rdbrewer4 Trump: Keep throwing those giant hand grenades into the amnesty debate  You're pissing off all the right people in the GOP  
Why does a failed magazine like @Forbes constantly seek out trivial nonsense  Their circulation way down  @Clare_OC 
Dummy @Clare_OC @Forbes: Tiny fragrance deal with Parlux means nothing  Still sold at Trump Tower    
Dummy @Clare_OC from failing @Forbes magazine: NASCAR deal was 1 nite ballroom  ESPN was small golf outing    
Dummy writer @Clare_OC from failing @Forbes magazine works so hard to make such trivial license deals look important… 
@gomrunner @realDonaldTrump keep up the tempo and don't listen to the RNC You are correctly presenting what people want  
@customwww @Clare_OC @Forbes Again   not news   news is   he leads NC & will have NH on next true poll   stop attacking the truth

@rbern11162 @SharNeal Donald Trump   keep it up you only get flack when you are close to the target  I support you completely 
@SharNeal @ericbolling @TheFive a lot of us support Trump because of his support to stop illegals from killing anyone else 
@_JoshBishop @ppppolls gop or dem  you have to love Trumps blunt honesty  So many things wrong most won't point out  Borders big problem

@RossMahan1952: @realDonaldTrump @krauthammer Like Harry Truman  you tell them the truth and they think it's hell  Give em hell Donald 

@KBrocking: @realDonaldTrump @krauthammer The Donald is the only good Republican candidate  in my opinion  Rubio  Perry  etc    Um  no  
@DavidBougs: @krauthammer Krauthammer sold some books  now His Pomposity thinks he knows US Pres politics    just another DC insider 



You mean George Bush sends our soldiers into combat  they are severely wounded  and then he wants $120 000 to make a boring speech to them  
Jeb's brother George insisted on a $100 000 fee and $20 000 for a private jet to speak at a charity for severely wounded vets  Not nice 
Do you believe that highly overrated political pundit @krauthammer said this is the best Republican field in 35 years  What a dope

 @AnnCoulter U were great last nite @ericbolling on FOX  Our country has become a dumping ground for the world I'll get it to stop & fast 
People rarely say that many conservatives didn’t vote for Mitt Romney  If I can get them to vote for me  we win in a landslide

We have got to take our country back  It's time

Thank you @loudobbsnews  I will be trying very hard to prove you right great show 


Jeb Bush will never secure our border or negotiate great trade deals for American workers  Jeb doesn't see & can't solve the problems  
I appreciate the GOP candidates who remain strong on border security  They know I am right  A nation without borders cannot survive  
Rick Perry failed at the border  Now he is critical of me  He needs a new pair of glasses to see the crimes committed by illegal immigrants

@nanaelaine7: I can't wait for your inauguration The beginning of the end to these criminal immigrants  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Thanks  

Why would Republican candidates want the support of Mitt Romney  He lost an election against Obama that should NEVER have been lost 

@SharNeal: ANY conservative candidate who disses DonaldTrump's stand on illegals will not get my vote he stands for US first over Illegals  

What about the undocumented immigrant with a record who killed the beautiful young women (in front of her father) in San Fran  Get smart

The leader and negotiators representing Mexico are far smarter and more cunning than the leader and negotiators representing the U S  
Only very stupid people think that the United States is making good trade deals with Mexico Mexico is killing us at the border and at trade 
 @billmaher: Bill  you are really beginning to understand what is going on with Trump actually  you always knew

Anyone who wants strong borders and good trade deals for the US should boycott @Univision  
Once again the Bush appointed Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has let us down  Jeb pushed him hard Remember 
I love Mexico but not the unfair trade deals that the US so stupidly makes with them  Really bad for US jobs  only good for Mexico  
Univision wants to back out of signed @MissUniverse contract because I exposed the terrible trade deals that the U S  makes with Mexico  
Mexican gov doesn't want me talking about terrible border situation & horrible trade deals  Forcing Univision to get me to stop no way 
@JWCesare I appreciate @realDonaldTrump and his straight talk  Our country needs this  
@nanaelaine7 @realDonaldTrump only YOU can make it GREAT again  Your plan is the only one inside reality  MAKE AMERICA GREAT with TRUMP

 @WhoopiGoldberg had better surround herself with better hosts than Nicole Wallace  who doesn't have a clue  The show is close to death 
The ratings for The View are really low  Nicole Wallace and Molly Sims are a disaster  Get new cast or just put it to sleep  Dead T V  
I am really beginning to respect Mark Halperin and John Heilemann as political reporters they truly get why Trump poll numbers are high  
Just out  the new nationwide @FoxNews poll has me alone in 2nd place  closely behind Jeb Bush but Bush will NEVER Make America Great Again 
Uncomfortable looking NBC reporter Willie Geist calls me to ask for favors and then mockingly smiles when he is told of my high poll numbers

Out of hundreds of deals & transactions  I have used the bankruptcy laws a few times to make deals better  Nothing personal  just business  
Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool  Icahn  Black  Zell—but nobody says they went bankrupt 
People buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals  It’s a very effective & commonly used business tool  
Stop saying I went bankrupt  I never went bankrupt but like many great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage—smart 

Has Charles @krauthammer ever apologized for being so totally wrong on Iraq  I called it right in every way—Make America Great Again

President Obama  you have a big job to do  Go to Baltimore and bring both sides together  With proper leadership  it can be done Do it  
Our country has to come together  We have to start working with  and really liking  each other  The whole world is watching Baltimore  

The Mayor of Baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters space to destroy another real genius 
Now that the ineffective Baltimore Police have allowed the city to be destroyed  are the U S  taxpayers expected to rebuild it (again)  
Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore 
Blatant and rampant property destruction in Baltimore as the police stand by and watch  Should be a lesson on how NOT to handle riots  SAD 
Wow  15 policemen hurt in Baltimore  some badly Where is the National Guard  Police must get tough  and fast Thugs must be stopped

Republicans should not be giving Obama fast track authority on trade  The Trans Pacific Partnership will squeeze our manufacturing sector 
The Trans Pacific Partnership is an attack on America's business  It does not stop Japan's currency manipulation  This is a bad deal

The reason Ed Schultz said nice things about me is that I’m the only Repub who won't cut Social Security  etc  I’ll make America rich again 
I’m a conservative  but the weakness of conservatives is that they destroy each other  whereas liberals unite to win  
With a stupid guy like Jonah Goldberg who uses “tweeting like a 14 year old girl” to hit me  no wonder the NRO is doing so poorly  @JonahNRO 
People have been forced to resign positions for far less than @JonahNRO’s “tweeting like a 14 year old girl” 
 @JonahNRO You stated that I started “relentlessly tweeting like a 14 year old girl   ” Horrible insult to women  Resign now or later 
“When you can't make them see the light  make them feel the heat ” – Ronald Reagan

@SamDoyle12 @realDonaldTrump great posts  As a budding entrepreneur  I appreciate the quotes Great work hard and good luck 

Entrepreneurs: Be tough  be smart  be personable  but don’t take things personally  That’s good business  
Entrepreneurs: Don’t ever think you’ve done it all already or that you’ve done your best  You haven't so don't limit yourself 
Entrepreneurs: Follow your instincts and keep your focus intact  You alone know where you really want to go  
Entrepreneurs: Paying attention can be a cost effective way of protecting yourself  
Entrepreneurs: Look at the solution  not the problem  Learn to focus on what will give results  
Entrepreneurs: Keep your momentum  Without momentum  a lot of great ideas go nowhere  
Entrepreneurs: Keep the big picture in mind  There are always opportunities & possibilities  and thinking too small can negate a lot of them

The Mexican legal system is corrupt  as is much of Mexico  Pay me the money that is owed me now and stop sending criminals over our border 


The evening news broadcasts must stop talking about weather—boring and too many other topics  
I could fix tv talk shows that are doing poorly—there is tremendous talent out there waiting to be tapped—and nobody sees it 
Put the glamour  beauty & mystery back in the Oscars and the ratings will zoom  Also  & most importantly  the Oscars need credibility  
I told everybody the Oscars were no good—Nielsen ratings confirmed  one of the lowest ratings in history  
The @HuffingtonPost is a total joke & laughing stock of journalism  as is gross Arianna Huffington  They don’t report the facts 
I have a lawsuit in Mexico’s corrupt court system that I won but so far can’t collect  Don’t do business with Mexico 
The Oscars were a great night for Mexico & why not—they are ripping off the US more than almost any other nation  
The talks between the U S  and Iran are going on forever  WORLD'S LONGEST NEGOTIATION  Obama has no idea what he is doing incompetent 

@JPNwrites The Oscars can learn a lot from the Miss Universe pageant  @realDonaldTrump True 
@JCL30 @realDonaldTrump had a run round @TurnberryBuzz Ails this morning  Going to be great when all the changes are finished  Thanks  
Entrepreneurs: Keep your focus and keep your momentum  Believe in yourself if you don't  no one else will either

Word is that Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd  who has failed so badly with Meet the Press  will be taking over for now irrelevant Brian Williams

Whether you think you can or think you can't  you're right  Henry Ford 
Now that Mitt is gone  all we have to do is get Bush to drop out and Trump to run—and we will win 
When I broadly proclaimed Mitt “choked” – and would do it again—everybody said yeah  he’s right  
I will take full credit for Mitt Romney dropping out of the race—looks like he won’t be endorsing Trump any time soon  

Mitt did the right thing—not because he had to but because he never would have been given a second chance after his first fiasco 
Everyone is saying the bad news is that Donald Trump is going to take credit & they are right—Mitt wouldn’t have won anyway

@fantasticharris: @realDonaldTrump loves the @Patriots 

Getting ready to go on @KellyandMichael two great people 
I guess Rupert Murdoch and the @nypost don't like Donald Trump  Such false reporting about my big hit in Iowa  Even my enemies said bull  
Wow  I have always liked the @nypost but they have really lied when they covered me in Iowa  Packed house  standing O  best speech Sad

@GeneLingerfelt: Country's been run by low I Q  people for years  Why @SenTedCruz  @realDonaldTrump  amaze us when they speak  
Apprentice = big hit  Miss Universe = Big hit  I always get big ratings  If I hosted Meet the Press instead of Sleepy Eyes a smash @NBCNews 
I am convinced that sleepy eyes Chuck Todd was only a placeholder for someone else at Meet the Press  He bombed  franchise in ruins @nbc 

President Obama  our great leader  wants to declare martial law in New York City as a means of helping out with the massive storm  
Wow  the final ratings for the Miss Universe Pageant show that it won in all key demos number one on Sunday  I have a winner

Remember  when guns are outlawed  only outlaws will have guns 
Isn’t it interesting that the tragedy in Paris took place in one of the toughest gun control countries in the world  
If the people so violently shot down in Paris had guns  at least they would have had a fighting chance  
Congratulations to new Congressman @leezeldin being named to House Foreign Affairs Comm  and co chair the House Republican Israel Caucus  
Why does Obama continue to release the worst of the worst from Gitmo  Look at Paris and wake up 
My condolences and prayers to the victims of the terrorist attack in Paris

To EVERYONE  including all haters and losers  HAPPY NEW YEAR  Work hard  be smart and always remember  WINNING TAKES CARE OF EVERYTHING 

In the end  you're measured not by how much you undertake but by what you finally accomplish  
Without passion you don't have energy  without energy you have nothing  Find work that you love and the energy will be there  
If you're interested in 'balancing' work and pleasure  stop trying to balance them  Instead make your work more pleasurable

@MusicByJules: Trump: (on Sony's Amy Pascal) She should be fired for being stupid  That's hilarious~Thanks for the laugh @foxandfriends 

I will be on @foxandfriends at 7:00 in 10 minutes  HAVE A GREAT DAY ALL 

No wonder Sony is doing so badly  Really stupid leadership that wants Al Sharpton to help  Watch him turn the tables on chief Amy Pascal  
Can you believe that Sony chief Amy Pascal wants to meet with Al Sharpton to seek forgiveness for her racial slurs  Al is laughing at her 
@PianoBecca: @realDonaldTrump In love with Trump Tower too Clearly Tower built by man who is strong & abel to serve as OUR PRESEDENT 
@fackinpeter: @realDonaldTrump I think you should be Barbara Walters' most fascinating person of 2014 I agree but have already been twice 




@Jetsbb: @realDonaldTrump That win will have massive ramifications for the next decade  A very bleak day for the @nyjets I agree 
The Jets should have let them score to get the number one draft pick  who will be really good  It will just never change for them 
@888maggie888: @ApprenticeNBC I want to see @realDonaldTrump He has the best hair in the biz you know His wife is amazing too

@KingOf_Class: @realDonaldTrump hey Donald   in love with Trump Tower on 5th avenue during the holidays 
@Gdestefano95: Anyone else like to see Trump in office  He's an American patriot with real experience and a huge stake in the economy 


@hersheyKISSling: I'd have to say that @realDonaldTrump has one of the best accounts on Twitter

@tray24u1: @realDonaldTrump: If America was under the threat of imminent attack  would Obama use torture or a kiss  

@PianoBecca: @realDonaldTrump when will you anounce your running for Presedent  Thousands MILLLIONS have baited breath we NEED you 

@YoChambers: @realDonaldTrump @toptv005 @VikkiTB we've had 16 years of bad presidents  war terrorism  bad economy etc    
@toptv005: @VikkiTB he was thé Very First one to warn people about Barack Hussein Obama & people blamed him  Well  he was right 
“Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in the world The Marines don't have that problem ” Ronald Reagan 
@VikkiTB: @realDonaldTrump is so right with everything he is saying run    Please run for president 
Isn't it interesting that immediately after September 11th  everybody was asking for  and indeed demanding  torture of any kind  No reports 

When terrorists are beheading and executing American citizens in such a brutal way the report on torture should be the least of our concerns 
@ConstanceMcN: @realDonaldTrump: Donald  I am in love and admire you Run for president in 2016 and all will be well 
The terrorists cut off the heads of Americans and laugh  then want to sell us the bodies for $1 000 000  We fight over sleep deprivation 
@jvas1110: @realDonaldTrump Trump for PRESIDENT 

@PianoBecca: I AM GOING TO VOTE FOR @realDonaldTrump IN 2016 BECAUSE WE NEED A LEADER WITH VISION 
@PeterDay20: @realDonaldTrump love how you speak your mind Well  somebody has to 

These Islamists chop Americans’ heads off and want to destroy us  We should be applauding the CIA  not persecuting them  
If America was under the threat of imminent attack  would Obama use torture or a kiss  

@redvetttes: @realDonaldTrump @itsRyanHilton if he tells China where to go  He has my vote 
@The_Lady_Colors: @realDonaldTrump @itsRyanHilton He would be the very best of what this country needs today 

@itsRyanHilton: I honestly can't wait forTrump to announce he is running for President a strong no BS leader who will put America 1st

Policy towards our enemies: Hit them hard  hit them fast  hit them often & then tell them it was because they are the enemy 
Obama & Democrat leaders did a great disservice by releasing the papers on torture  The world is laughing at us—they think we are fools

Conde Nast made a big mistake going into the World Trade Center  The place is a total disaster  and I feel this is only the beginning 
People are really unhappy with the endless security checks at the new World Trade Center  Durst is a terrible manager  Tenants furious 
Durst is a disaster at operating the new World Trade Center  It takes forever for workers or visitors to get in with impossible security

If ObamaCare should not be repealed then why has Obama & Congress exempted their staffs

@moore2score: Why is it almost every person I know thinks that Mac Miller's only song is Donald Trump and then he disappeared    True 




President Obama has absolutely no control (or respect) over the African American community they have fared so poorly under his presidency  

Who is the moron who decided to release the Ferguson grand jury findings after 9:00 o'clock in the evening  What were they thinking  
Our country is totally fractured and  with our weak leadership in Washington  you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places 
Sadly  because president Obama has done such a poor job as president  you won't see another black president for generations 
As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U S  economically  they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson 
Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the U S  as they watch the Ferguson riot 
If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite  you would still be having the riots right now 
Despite having a black president  the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades If Obama were a leader  this would not be the case 
@TheRealZach49: This is why we need @realDonaldTrump in office  @BarackObama doesn't know how to keep order 
@Abdul_Akbarzai1: @TheRealZach49: @realDonaldTrump can't wait for you to take over this country and rebuild what Obama destroyed 
@D_Mellette: @realDonaldTrump for president 2k16 
Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening a prime time for riots Not smart  
Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal  Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators 
ISIS is starting its own currency  May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented  
There is no excuse for riots in Ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome  
Fact – Amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness  Obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform  
Premiering on January 4th  the 14th season of @ApprenticeNBC will have major fireworks every episode  The Board Room is electric

They're going to riot in Ferguson no matter what  
You don't necessarily need the best location  What you need is the best deal  The Art of the Deal 


If we do not protect the rule of law then we can expect even more illegals to cross the border  Obama’s executive amnesty is dangerous  
Iraq should be paying us while we fight ISIS  Give the money to the families of our brave soldiers

Congratulations to @SixteenChicago @TrumpChicago for being honored with a @MichelinGuideChi two star rating again this year 

Just like Jonathan Gruber viciously lied & called Americans “stupid” on ObamaCare  many consultants are doing the same on Global Warming  


Obama’s China ‘climate’ deal binds America with language of ‘will’ curb emissions now while China only ‘intends’ to curb in 2030  Bad deal 

ObamaCare/RomneyCare architect Gruber was paid over $6M with our tax dollars yet Obama only claims he ‘was some adviser ’ 
Deportations are now at a record low  Obama manipulated the numbers to lie to the public that they were at a record high  Secure the border

Fact – every successful GOP Senate candidate just elected ran on repealing ObamaCare  In January  it’s time to move

@beautifulblusky: Now that Republicans are dominating The House  all America needs now Mr  Trump is YOU for 2016 President of the USA 
Obama’s Amnesty Executive Order can now be stopped by Majority Leader McConnell with riders  That’s one reason we needed the Senate  
The Maryland Democrat Party attacked me with a racist flyer  @Hogan4Governor won  2nd GOP governor elected in 40 years  

Yesterday was a referendum on ObamaCare & all other Obama fiascos  Republicans can now rein him in

 @FLGovScott: Amazing race  tremendous courage you deserved this win for a very old fashioned reason you have been a great governor 
One year ago I started calling President Obama INCOMPETENT and people thought it was too tough  Tonight everyone is using that word 
Looking like a really big night for Republicans a tremendous refutation of President Obama and his failed policies

I would absolutely consider investing in Atlantic City again  great and hard working people  but much would have to change taxes  regs   etc 
Yes  I won the right to have my name taken off Trump Plaza in A C  because it was not operated up to a very high standard and NO involvement 
I made a fortune in Atlantic City  got out years ago (great timing)  and havn't been back in many years  I have NOTHING to do with A C  
With all that is happening with Ebola  including the doctor who so easily came back to New York  Obama still refuses to stop the flights

@misskweenbree: @realDonaldTrump Run for President 
@BBCoachKK: @realDonaldTrump Oh Donald I love you 
@ItBegins2012: @realDonaldTrump Trump  you are great you speak your mind and should continue to do so 
President Obama  you are a complete and total disaster  but you have a chance to do something great and important: STOP THE FLIGHTS 
President Obama has a major meeting on the N Y C  Ebola outbreak  with people flying in from all over the country  but decided to play golf 
I never thought I'd say it in my lifetime  but President Barack Hussein Obama  aka Barry Sotoro  is a far worse president than Jimmy Carter 
I have been saying for weeks for President Obama to stop the flights from West Africa  So simple  but he refused  A TOTAL incompetent 
Ebola has been confirmed in N Y C   with officials frantically trying to find all of the people and things he had contact with Obama's fault 
If this doctor  who so recklessly flew into New York from West Africa has Ebola then Obama should apologize to the American people & resign 
There is a good possibility that a person who treated patients in West Africa and who FLEW into New York has Ebola  Touched many  bedlam 
Double digit premium increases because of ObamaCare  Dems trying to delay showing numbers until after election  but news is spreading fast

Tremendous pressure on President Obama to institute a travel ban on Ebola stricken West Africa  At some point this stubborn dope will fold 
@not_that_a @realDonaldTrump Wearing a Trump tie doesn't make you as smart a businessman as Trump  but it does make you look smart @Macy's 

Alison Grimes supports harsh restrictions to kill coal industry & supports Obama's anti gun legislation  Vote @Team_Mitch 
Liberal SD Dem candidate Rick Weiland wants to expand ObamaCare to single payer & opposes Ebola travel ban  Send @RoundsforSenate to Senate 
“Dem candidates are all folks who vote with me ” – Barack Obama describing ALL Democrat Senate candidates

Why are we letting the three girls  who left the U S  to join ISIS  back into the country  How stupid has our once respected country become 
If there is one more Ebola case in the U S   a full travel ban will be instituted  This common sense move should have been done long ago 
@rrogers19: Please save this country  @realDonaldTrump 
@BeyerTristen: @realDonaldTrump A man of business and success  please run for president and fix this country 
@alyssatomazin44: @realDonaldTrump seriously needs to run for president 

The United States troops which were sent to West Africa have only gotten 4 hours of Ebola training very unfair to them and their families 
The United States  under President Obama  has truly become the gang that couldn't shoot straight  Everything he touches turns to garbage 
The U S  accidentally air dropped a large shipment of military weapons and supplies right into the middle of ISIS as enemy laughs Very sad 
Negotiation is an art  Treat it like one  
Don’t believe Kay Hagan on Ebola travel ban  She also promised that you would keep your healthcare plan under ObamaCare  Vote @ThomTillis 

I will be in Washington  D C  tomorrow to receive the 2014 Joseph Wharton Award at the Wharton Club of D C —a great honor @Wharton 
@northcutt2013: @realDonaldTrump @mrkenbutler no  he can't and will not run  Great man yes  not worth the mud slinging Don't be so sure 

@mrkenbutler: Donald  You are without a doubt the only person who can correct the collision course Obama has us on  Please run in 2016

@AwakKeNTV: @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump for president please save us man 
I will be on @foxandfriends at 7 00 45 minutes  Talking about Ebola  Obama and other strange U S  happenings 
I just returned from Iowa what a beautiful state  The people are amazing and the event for Congressman Steve King was a great success 
Do you believe Obama just said that America would be less safe with a travel ban from West Africa This is the thinking of a total mad man 
The lobbyist and political hack that President Obama just appointed as the Ebola Czar  just missed his first major meeting on Ebola A joke 

@johnnydollar01: And people zinged Donald Trump for talking about Ebola  How is this Klain guy any more qualified  Actually  less qualified

If I were president Sgt  Andrew Tahmooressi would be let out of jail with one phone call  If not Mexico would pay a price like never before 
Do you think the 14 African nations that are banning West Africans from coming into their nations are being called racists  Perhaps not 
14 African nations have totally banned West Africans from entering their nations  Likewise many other nations  But the U S  = COME ON IN 

Obama just appointed an Ebola Czar with zero experience in the medical area and zero experience in infectious disease control  A TOTAL JOKE 
If you can’t see it  you can’t make it happen  Entrepreneurs  chase your dreams with resolute focus & determination  Be positive 



Now Michelle Nunn will not admit she voted for Obama  Of course she did  Nunn supports ObamaCare & is anti Second Amendment  
The new Ebola czar will report to the WH & NSA adviser Susan Rice  More mismanagement & duplicity with CDC  Obama is terrible executive

Looks like Obama will not stop the very potentially dangerous flights to and from West Africa  What the hell is wrong with this guy  
 @katyperry I watched Russell Brand and I think his mind is fried he looks really bad  Russell is a total joke  a dummy who is lost 
 @katyperry Katy  what the hell were you thinking when you married loser Russell Brand  There is a guy who has got nothing going  a waste 

 @katyperry must have been drunk when she married Russell Brand @rustyrockets – but he did send me a really nice letter of apology 
I watched Russell Brand @rustyrockets on the @jimmyfallon show the other night—what the hell do people see in Russell—a major loser

@PeriodPride: The most successful people are the people that had the right idea but never ever quit or gave up ~ @realDonaldTrump 
I am starting to think that there is something seriously wrong with President Obama's mental health  Why won't he stop the flights  Psycho 
It is time for the airline pilots  flight attendants and the airlines themselves to stop flights to and from West Africa  Do it right now

I can't believe that Mitt Romney would run for president again  He had his chance and blew it in the last weeks of the race  
A nurse in Dallas who treated Ebola patient Thomas Duncan was allowed to fly to Cleveland She should never have been so allowed The real JV 
With all of the words President Obama just dispensed at his press conference  he didn't say what we all want to hear  I'LL STOP THE FLIGHTS

John @CahillForAG is one of the most respected people in politics  Dopey @AGSchneiderman is one of the least respected

Obama still refuses to stop the flights  Is he stubborn or just plain incompetent I say both

So many problems in the U S  and leadership that is hopeless   and now  on top of everything else  we just hit $18 trillion in debt 

As ISIS and Ebola spread like wildfire  the Obama administration just submitted a paper on how to stop climate change (aka global warming)  
Can you believe that with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U S   President Obama spent the day playing golf Worse than Carter 
If you never want to be criticized  for goodness' sake don't do anything new  Jeff Bezos

@iHunt88: I think it's about time @realDonaldTrump stands up and announces he's running for President  
I don't know if President Obama isn't stopping the flights from Ebola torn West Africa because he is stubborn  stupid  or just doesn't care 
Here we go A healthcare worker who treated Thomas Duncan  the man who flew into the U S  from West Africa infected with Ebola  caught it 
President Obama  NOW  bring our 4000 innocent and ill trained soldiers home from West Africa  before it is too late  AND STOP THE FLIGHTS 

@billyhaze: Great interview Tuesday past with Jim Gardner  must be a breath of fresh air speaking with such a well respected journalist 
Remember when I said when Saddam Hussein fell the new leader of Iraq will be meaner and tougher and hate the U S  even more  Welcome ISIS 
If a conservative Republican made the mistake that Mrs  Obama just made by calling Braley by the wrong name  it would be the biggest story

Obama is making the Ebola problem much worse than it needs to be in the U S  by not halting flights from West Africa  Airport testing a joke

I feel sorry for the 4000 soldiers who are being forced to go the West Africa to fight Ebola  Their families are up in arms  Not trained

I can't believe Mitch McConnell isn't way up in the Kentucky polls  Massive seniority brings so much power and status to State  Brings K $'s 
@Dundee_Tam: @realDonaldTrump @dollymund yes Mr  Trump please run for the Oval Office and help bring the USA back to prominence  
@kyleraccio: @realDonaldTrump We need a real leader  We need Trump  Thanks  

@Vinnie_Vegas_76:Donald why don't you run for president  If you run the USA like you run your businesses  the USA would be a better place  
Despite the ever increasing Ebola disaster  Obama refuses to stop flights from West Africa It's almost like he's saying F you to U S  public 
@Hilight: Just watched you on @gretawire Great interview as always Please run for President :) @realDonaldTrump 
@DaMeechRiebl: Just saw your interview with @gretawire  Mr  Trump just run for president you'd be surprised to learn we all agree with you 

@RzcarlsonRuth: @realDonaldTrump just saw you on Greta     Love listening to you speak  I have so much respect for you  Thank you 
Obama has missed 58% of his intelligence briefings  But our president does make 100% of his fundraisers  

I will be on On The Record @gretawire tonight at 7 PM

Do you think crooked @AGSchneiderman will ever challenge the NFL tax status  No—too many friends and contributors in @nfl  


@foxesden8: @realDonaldTrump Do you ever sleep Not too much 
I will be on Fox & Friends (@foxandfriends) at 7 00  Fighting Ebola will be a topic 
I'm not going to be watching much NFL football anymore  Too time consuming  too boring  too many flags and too soft  Focus on other things 
What the hell is Obama doing in allowing all of these potentially very sick people to continue entering the U S  Is he stupid or arrogant  
I don't know what it is  but I'm getting totally bored watching NFL football  Too many penalties and far too soft T V  off and back to work 
The Jets just don't have it  Time for a quarterback change 
@RobertUndefined: This is where @realDonaldTrump needs to be the President  
@x_victoria97: @realDonaldTrump should be president   

President Obama  I have an idea Pretend that West Africa is Israel and then you will be able to stop the Ebola area flights  
President Obama close down the flights from Ebola infected areas right now  before it is too late What the hell is wrong with you  
@fredsmith433: @realDonaldTrump Please run for president 
Something very important  and indeed society changing  may come out of the Ebola epidemic that will be a very good thing: NO SHAKING HANDS 
This Ebola patient Thomas Duncan  who fraudulently entered the U S  by signing false papers  is causing havoc  If he lives  prosecute 
@InTheElections: @realDonaldTrump My advice: run for president 
If Ebola is so non contagious  how come an NBC cameraman caught it so quickly while over in West Africa  U S  is behaving very foolishly 
Can you believe that President Obama still hasn't stopped the flights and people pouring into the U S  from West Africa  TERRIBLE PRESIDENT 

@calfofgod: @realDonaldTrump you are the Smartest man in america  Why aren't you president  Who needs Obama  We need you Please run 
@DamienDuplantis: @realDonaldTrump For President 
@Ricolodean: @realDonaldTrump I pray that one day my country will wake up and see that you are the leader we need  Please run in 2016  

@ValEveretts: Obama isn't smart enough to identify what the best and brightest would look like  Please run for POTUS  We need you  
@DrugFreeBlayde: @realDonaldTrump is one of the smartest men in america    put him in the office  So true  thanks 







Really interesting  President Obama was quick to shut down flights to Isreal but is totally unwilling to shut down flights from West Africa 
@not_that_actor Wow Andy  such amazing writing and thought  Thank you 

Saw Michael Jordan and Ray Allen today playing golf at Trump National Doral  the Blue Monster  Great guys 
Ebola patient Duncan lied on his exit papers by saying he never came into contact with a person with Ebola  He knew he did  and person died  
How incompetent are our leaders allowing these Ebola infected people to come into our country with all of the problems and danger entailed 
The Ebola patient who came into our country knew exactly what he was doing  Came into contact with over 100 people Here we go I told you so 
The brand new hotel at Trump National Doral has the most beautiful rooms and suites in Miami  Enjoy 
I just arrived at Trump National Doral in Miami where I'll spend the day checking work just completed by contractors  This place is amazing 
Ebola is much easier to transmit than the CDC and government representatives are admitting  Spreading all over Africa and fast  Stop flights

We have millions in our country unemployed yet we are wasting millions arming Syrian ‘rebels ’ What is wrong with Washington  
Obama can attend a fundraiser every day but can’t be bothered to get briefed on national security  Commander in Chief  
Our national security starts at the border  Do you think ISIS & al Qaeda are just in the Middle East  

@RWDF1 @realDonaldTrump They are planning on building windturbines near Turnberry Golf course  on Knoweside hill Not without a fight 

How is ABC Television allowed to have a show entitled Blackish   Can you imagine the furor of a show  Whiteish Racism at highest level  
Stop flights into the U S  from West Africa immediately 
The woman who is the Secret Service Director looks like she is way over her head Why can't the president appoint the best and the brightest  
@jrhennessy: There's only one man I'd trust to fight ISIS  That's right: @realDonaldTrump Good choice  thanks

@Nan_Imburgia: @realDonaldTrump Why is it O makes absolutely no sense while Donald Trump makes perfect sense 
@kimgt15: @realDonaldTrump RUN FOR PRESIDENT Save us 
The United States must immediately institute strong travel restrictions or Ebola will be all over the United States a plague like no other 
How dumb is our president to send thousands of poorly trained and ill equipped soldiers over to West Africa to fight Ebola  Stop all flights 
@ChaseHassey: @realDonaldTrump DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT Please run  No one will defeat you  Thank you 
Here we go I stated long ago that we should cancel all flights from West Africa  Now we have Ebola in U S   AND IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE 
President Obama should stay out of the Hong Kong protests  we have enough problems in our own country Can't even properly police White House 
Success seems to be connected with action  Successful people keep moving  They make mistakes  but they don't quit  Conrad Hilton 
Fact Obama does not read his intelligence briefings nor does he get briefed in person by the CIA or DOD  Too busy I guess 


Keep your momentum  Without momentum  a lot of great ideas go nowhere  
I've realized that success requires 100% effort and 100% focus  Nothing less  Get out there and go for it

@Yankee_RangerNV @realDonaldTrump Don't forget you were also the ONLY person to host Wrestlemania in back to back years So true  thanks

Entrepreneurs: Believe in yourself  If you don't  no one else will either  
Entrepreneurs: Achievers move forward at all times  Achievement is not a plateau  it's a beginning  
I've realized that success requires 100% effort and 100% focus  Nothing less  
Does anybody notice that Atlantic City lost its magic after I left years ago  I had the big boxing  introduced UFC (ask Dana) the best shows 
Can you believe that the U S  will be sending 3000 troops to Africa to help with Ebola They will come home infected  We have enough problems 
It is so sad to see what has happened to Atlantic City  So many bad decisions by the pols over the years airport  convention center  etc  
I left Atlantic City years ago  good timing  Now I may buy back in  at much lower price  to save Plaza & Taj  They were run badly by funds 
If you can’t focus with unyielding resolve  then you will never be successful  Believe in yourself and you can accomplish your goals

 @SenScottBrown is the most competitive GOP option against Obama’s amnesty loving @SenatorSheehan  He can win 
Obama sent weapons through Benghazi to ISIS yet he is holding up shipments to Israel  What is he thinking  
Obama’s motto: If I don’t go on tax payer funded vacations & constantly fundraise then the terrorists win  
Once the ISIS thug who beheaded Foley is identified 100%  he should be bunker busted to hell

Just as I have been predicting for years  Iraq will fall to the people that hate the U S  the most just outside of Baghdad  Keep the oil 
The U S  cannot allow EBOLA infected people back  People that go to far away places to help out are great but must suffer the consequences

@MargoShear The Donald's going to be saying You're Hired to lots of people in the District @wusa9 True 
Less than 1% of Obama’s $4B immigration request will go towards immediate border security  A real scam  Enforce our laws now

Wow  Obama really put it to Israel by canceling flights there  This puts them at a tremendous disadvantage  Tourism and more will just stop  
Article: More illegals enter than people born in state each week http://www breitbart com/Big Government/2014/07/21/Texas State Sen More Illegals Enter than People Born in State Each Week … 
Why is Washington ready to spend billions on care for illegals while our VA is still in shambles  Vets should be the priority  
Going to D C  for big groundbreaking on Old Post Office site  Will be spectacular new hotel  Lots of jobs 
@ShakyStu: @realDonaldTrump @ayrshirepost @TrumpTurnberry Nice move Worth while investment  Can't wait to see how well it's finished 
@jeddprice: @realDonaldTrump Maybe the USA needs to cancel all the rest of Obama's vacations to actually deal with this

…In other words  Secy John Kerry is so out of his element… 
Secy John Kerry has a tough job but he looks so totally lost negotiating w/ those characters who are cleaning his clock  Sad to watch    

Eli Wallach was a great actor and a great guy  My opinion his performance in The Good the Bad and the Ugly was his all time best

The dying @NYDailyNews asked me to do an Editorial on the Central Park 5 ripoff & then they pretend it was my idea  Loser newspaper 
I wonder if when Secy  Kerry goes to Iraq and Afghanistan he pushes hard for them to look at GLOBAL WARMING and study the carbon footprint  
Do you believe that Secy  KERRY just went to Egypt to talk about human rights problems and this as everything is being blown up around him

@RiskyLiberal: @realDonaldTrump Donald  you are the smartest man ever  and the most visionary Thanks 
I'd bet the lawyers for the Central Park 5 are laughing at the stupidity of N Y C  when there was such a strong case against their clients 
How much money are the lawyers for the Central Park Five getting out of the 40 million dollars  or are they paid by the City (or both)  
N Y  City is paying FORTY MILLION DOLLARS to five men that many think are guilty as hell  So many facts should have been trial  Politics 
@BROONEYBROONEY: @realDonaldTrump love your thoughts and opinions on the Central Park 5 
@abdulmalikm103: @realDonaldTrump @WhiteShaunwhite Donald Trump will serve a Positive Government if Elected president

@jlk5253 @realDonaldTrump @TrumpChicago I love the sign  It is tasteful and classy  just like everything you do  Thank you  

Manufacturing is now less than 9% of US GDP  The Rust Belt  heart of our country’s factory sector  has been destroyed by our leaders  
What took so long to catch only 1 of the Benghazi terrorists  Especially after the killer has been taunting the US in the press f/2 yrs  


Will the Benghazi terrorist use the videotape as a defense  If so  will Obama apologize to him  
A country that cannot protect its borders is a country destined to fail  Another broken promise by our leaders in Washington

@Mark_quoted: @realDonaldTrump reading Think Big and can't help but wonder why you ain't president yet  Well  now is when we most need it 

@stevenowell: @realDonaldTrump don't normally agree with you but it (Pinehurst) looked like an absolute dump  
@mindgone222: @realDonaldTrump @jry227 People just want to mess with you because you're you  It's your building  F them  
@Lady_Rin_Kelly: @realDonaldTrump  I love the sign Please let's make a hashtag  that seems like it solves all world problems  
@adhowe5: I thought the Trump signage was very well done  Looks great @realDonaldTrump 
@TheBrazilTrader: @realDonaldTrump I LOVE THE SIGN 

@tttmon: @realDonaldTrump You are amazing I loved that you rewarded the bus driver who saved a suicidal girl  Thank you  my great honor 
@DonDraper_NY:  @Gotham @ConradHiltonNY @RachelMenkenNY @WaldorfNYC I read @realDonaldTrump  He's smartest man around  a @BonaFideMadMen

@jrnicholas8: Love the Trump in Chicago  Those who don't like it are jealous Capitalism is where it's at We need more signs like it 
I bought the great Turnberry Resort today considered by many to have the greatest golf course in the World  I will take good care of it 
@adamjannke: @realDonaldTrump went to Doonbeg last year  loved it 
@joebud123: @realDonaldTrump Which one of your books should I read first  The Art of the Deal 
@DeeHogan21: @realDonaldTrump along with @DoonbegLodge    heaven on earth 
@BackOnTrackUSA: Remember the terrorists that Obama has been arming in Syria against Assad  Well now they are marching on Bagdad  
@BackOnTrackUSA These are the same terrorists Obama has been arming in Syria & have attacked us on 911 Obama's foreign policy is a disaster 
@Waldrop15w: @Kenny_Wallace @realDonaldTrump Iran controlling Iraq and all of its oil will be everyone's problem Our leaders are stupid 
I know about the “rustic” look on golf courses—but see photo of highly rated Trump National Philadelphia—a real gem pic twitter com/pgSW9kWVck 
Success comes with hard work  focus and luck  The luck comes to those who seek it out  If you are not in the game  you cannot get lucky  
When ISIS caught the soldiers  do you think they read them their legal rights prior to executing them  
Choose your own path: It doesn't have to be the path less traveled   What matters is that it's the right one for you  Vince Lombardi 
Iraq is no longer our problem  We never should have been there in the first place 

The VA scandal will only get worse over the time  Our vets deserve the best care possible  We must be open to private solutions  
Congratulations to @spurs on their @NBA championship  Well deserved  
If anybody else but Coore and Crenshaw designed Pinehurst they would be run out of town—(and the turtleback greens are totally unfair) 
The only reason I am critical of the Pinehurst look is because I’m a lover of golf—and that look on TV hurts golf badly

@Theramenes: Get @realDonaldTrump into WH He can lead and fix anything He is also strong and unafraid to do what is good for people

@davidcanlas88: I wish you would advice the Kardashians and the Jenner sisters on child rearing  You did a good job upbringing your girl  
@thespinepillow: @realDonaldTrump please run for prez  Would b great to have a real man in the White House again  
@JeniferStevens: Awful look to it     Not like Trump in Palm Beach and Briarcliff or Scotland that I've played  Your courses are the best 

@magnumCJ: @realDonaldTrump told the truth all day about Pinehurst 2  It is just not a good looking US Open course  So true 
@DeannaSpillyard: Chicago should be so lucky to have the King of New York invest in their city Love the sign It should be bigger JMO 
@Drake4444444: @realDonaldTrump We need Trump 1) in the NFL  2) in the Oval Office  and 3) on his own reality show  Cute 

@quotedojo: A little more moderation would be good  Of course  my life hasn't exactly been one of moderation  ~Donald Trump 
@gja360: @realDonaldTrump I read all of your books you truly are an inspiration Thanks  
@troytreanor: @shanebacon which got more viewers: final round of @usopengolf or @realDonaldTrump tweets about the course  Trump 
@SurayaZayn: @realDonaldTrump i find yourself and your children exemplary and inspirational  Sir  Thank You  
Big announcement tomorrow morning concerning the great Turnberry Resort in Scotland 

@benSEXT0N: @Cfeetsrevenge @LukeDonald @realDonaldTrump course didn't look good in HD just saying No  it looked terrible  bad for golf 
@TedatACA: I concur with @realDonaldTrump on Pinehurst  IMO: Those blasts from sandy areas looked like IEDs exploding In Kandahar Province  
@ichicagoscott: @realDonaldTrump it was nice of you to give @MattGinellaGC 15 minutes of fame that he wouldn't have had  I agree 
@welsh @realDonaldTrump you have made some great courses  but dont think that gives you the right to comment on every golf course I agree 
@MattGinellaGC Matt  how many club championships have you won  I hear zero  or 18 fewer than me Lets play for a lot  
@ic @MattGinellaGC stick to media like everyone else in it with worthless opinions  DonaldTrump is 10 000 times more successful than you  
@GolferMatt23: @realDonaldTrump Are the @MasterCard commercials filmed at Trump National LA  Yes  
@matthewhkurth: @realDonaldTrump played Trump Bedminster once   will never forget it  
@ZackAlcorn: @mikehyland21 @realDonaldTrump @aec4444 big time  I love Trump Bedminster 
@g3stover: @MattGinellaGC is barking up the wrong tree getting in a twitter war with @realDonaldTrump I can beat him in golf even easier 
@MattGinellaGC Matt  you know nothing about quality golf or what it takes to make golf successful  You are all talk  no substance 
@rink914: @IanJamesPoulter Actually agree   it may have been great to play but it looked atrocious on TV  I love golf  couldn't watch 
@CharlieMaikis: @realDonaldTrump I completely agree with DT here  Pinehurst looks bad  I wouldn't pay $400 to play if it looked like that  

@vmisciagna: @realDonaldTrump I've played the new Doral which is awesome one day I hope to play another Trump course 
@jeffokrina: @CBSSports @EyeOnGolf @realDonaldTrump: I agree with the Donald  What a goat track I'll take the beauty of Pebble any day 
@ClarkSmidt: Sir Donald  Rather than promote golf courses  please use your influence to deliver messages that will help fix our Country  
@aec4444: @realDonaldTrump I've played Pinehurst and Trump Bedminster and Donald has 2 in Bedminister that are superior  Thank you & true 
@MattGinellaGCSadly Matt  you don't understand golf (even though you think you do) I have numerous couses that are far superior to Pinehurst 
@MattGinellaGC I have watched Open Championships at Turnberry  one of the great golf courses of the World  Pinehurst not in the same league 
@MattGinellaGC My position on Pinehurst is correct bad for the game  a dried out cow pasture  You have no clue but keep trying 
Johnny Miller correctly very critical of greens at Pinehurst  Said they should be redone 

@jackhennessy12: @realDonaldTrump look better at lahinch or trump doonbeg  True 
@aec4444: @realDonaldTrump please don't let the USGA ruin your course in 2017 like they did Pinehurst  I won't 
@Robert_W_GA: @realDonaldTrump they think the course should be old school   you know  like before lawn care technology aka goats 
I'd bet the horrible look of Pinehurst translates into poor television ratings  This is not what golf is about 
@foossh:@GolfDigestMag @realDonaldTrump he has a point  fairways should be green  Scruff can be as bad as you want  Wouldn't pay top dollar 
@MomMom: Just saw the video of the bus driver saving the woman from jumping off overpass  You gave him a reward    good job Donald Thanks 
@epowell88: Worked @ restaurant for 33 yrs & got fired because they didn't think I could keep up  No severance Would u do that  NO WAY 
@MarkMoreland: It's worse for @PinehurstResort  I know I wouldn't pay $400 to play what looks like a neglected municipal course  
@timgerzabek: @realDonaldTrump @GolfDigestMag I thought this was the US Open not the wanna be British Open 
@jshamie: @GolfDigestMag couldn't agree more  The course is not punishing bad tee shots like a normal us open would  BORING FINISH 
@GolfDigestMag Big news from Scotland on Turnberry (which  by the way  blows Pinehurst away ) tomorrow morning  Stay tuned  
@GolfDigestMag Never in the history of televised golf has a course looked so bad and unattractive  A dry  burnt out mess Bad for golf  
 @HollySandersGC  Remember  it was Martin K who sank the big ten footer to win the Ryder Cup  He can handle the pressure 
I would like to wish all fathers  even the haters and losers  a very happy Fathers Day  
@zp_3: @realDonaldTrump Happy Birthday from your Trump Towers in West Palm  Keep up the good work A great place  thanks  
@edcloud9: No one man can turn this country around and get us back on track  But one @realDonaldTrump can 2016 HappyBirthday

@der_karsten: @realDonaldTrump Happy birthday to the best businessman in the world Thank you  

@jsimonwc: @MattGinellaGC @realDonaldTrump Built for golf  Not built for TV  That is true because it looks horrible on T V  SAD 
 @BlairKamin Blair  you may be the worst architectural critic in the business but thanks for your nice reviews about Trump Chicago & sign PR 

@PGongola: @realDonaldTrump @MattGinellaGC I THINK PINEHURST IS UGLY  

 @MattGinellaGC Have you ever seen Trump National/Bedminster or Trump International Golf links in Scotland  Both far better than Pinehurst 

 @MattGinellaGC Matt  the statement about Pinehurst looking like a local community golf course  awful   was not made by me but tweeted to me 
 @MattGinellaGC It's true Matt  the NEW Blue Monster is better than Pinehurst  so is Bedminster  Turnberry & Trump Aberdeen blow it away 
@tx_shaun: @realDonaldTrump happy birthday Donald Thanks for never being afraid to tell it like it is 



@DougHutchins77: @realDonaldTrump The world just won't be safe until the name Trump is emblazoned on the White House  
@DbigRock34: @realDonaldTrump Like I said  Trump for President  USA needs a positive change  
@Scleroshima: @realDonaldTrump you called it about 4 years ago about the spoils of war its all coming true now  So true 
@commishjoe: Happy Birthday to successful businessman and true American success story  He certainly tells it like it is Thank you  
@glock34girl: @realDonaldTrump please run and get America back on its feet  Stay tuned 

I have been very consistent and always said that Iraq would fall as soon as the U S  left  What a terrible waste of lives and money 
Iran will convince our incompetent President that they are trying to help us with Iraq  take over the country & oil  and O will say thanks 
Turnberry in Scotland is a far superior golf course to Pinehurst and it isn't even close Likewise the Blue Monster at Doral  
Iran is moving troops into Iraq under the guise that it is helping out  Actually  they will take over Iraq and all of their oil  Stupid U S  
@MoshoodAluko: Happy birthday to an American icon and a real estate el supremo    @realDonaldTrump Thanks  
@homesbyjeff: “@realDonaldTrump: @fahntastic24601: In Chicago and loving Trump tower  Those letters look great  @realDonaldTrump ”

@FASHfrontrunner: @realDonaldTrump Love the signage on the Chicago building I think you should request even bigger letters 
@stevewardrip: @realDonaldTrump @TrumpSign @cotyybaby Bravo TRUMP Signage Extremely exquisite 

If you want to be successful in business  you must take risks  Make sure each risk is calculated and can have a positive fallback  

Jailed USMC Sgt Andrew Tahmooressi should be released immediately  Since when does Mexico care about border security #BringBackOurMarine 
Had a great time yesterday on @theviewtv with @WhoopiGoldberg  @JennyMcCarthy  @SherriEShepherd & guest host @MrJerryOC 




@amybdt: @realDonaldTrump So many other things to worry about in this world and a sign is one    Give me a break LOVE IT 
@CJohnson623: @realDonaldTrump I love the Trump building in Chicago 
@DavennT: If you have a problem with @realDonaldTrump putting Trump on his building  you need to reassess your life  Get  Over  It  
@Trutt78: @realDonaldTrump you want to do something nice for Chicago and they shoot you down  Piss on Rahm  He is just an Obama lap dog  
@kvb423: @TODAYshow what a shame @RahmEmanuel is wasting money on @realDonaldTrump when we have CPS students in bldgs w/o AC 
@kverb12345: @realDonaldTrump sign is the right size given size of the building  
@Danoh1952: @TODAYshow @realDonaldTrump I like the Trump sign  


@arbyoliver: @realdonaldtrump Great Chicago sign  Do not bend to pressure  Right on I won't  thanks  

@The_RHLP: @realDonaldTrump pumped millions into our Chicago economy  My brother worked on that building for 3yrs  Rahm should thank him 



@inthelooptv: @realDonaldTrump Your sign is absolutely stunning in Chicago Now only if you could wear a suit & fight crime 
@Matthew_Erdman: DonaldTrump You built a beautiful high rise  you pay your taxes  you should be able to put up whatever signage you want  
The Iraqi Army is useless  President Obama  stay the hell out of Iraq (we should never have been there in the first place)  
@ThisIsJoshSmith: I'll say it you are likely the *only* Republican who could realistically beat Hillary in 2016  Please consider running 
@austinwalsh: @realDonaldTrump new sign looks awesome Congrats 
@russell_triston: @realDonaldTrump Would make a great Commander in Chief  True intelligence  Common sense  economy knowledge  leadership  
We should never have gone into Iraq but  once in  should have gotten out a lot faster  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
@DON_Ekwegba: When Mr  Trump wants to get at something he goes all the way  He Walks the talk  There are only a few of them left Thank you 
@nikkio: I know I'm a day early for your weekend celebrations Happy Birthday Donald Looking forward to your surprises for 2014 2015 Thanks 

@tstreck: @realDonaldTrump great building  Name looks awesome on it  
@artv1028: @BlairKamin @chicagotribune you don't like it because Trump is a conservative  How many jobs has Trump created in Chicago 
@aureliusjb: @realDonaldTrump Mr  Trump  I love your sign  it really spiffs up that stodgy old town  Keep up the great style statements  


@laura711hender: @realDonaldTrump Live in the suburbs but saw the TRUMP sign on your beautiful building  Really classy Love it 

@Annmajkrzak: @AP @cbschicago I like the Trump Logo on the building I feel this is a personal fight & will this fight cost IL residents 
@Nickkleutsch: @realDonaldTrump @trumpchicago personally I think the letters should be higher up  Make sure everyone can see that name 
@MajesticBrotha: @realDonaldTrump I'm a Liberal but I feel Mayor Emanual has bigger fish to fry in Chi town than a Trump sign 
@LoveandFate: @realDonaldTrump Your name on your building in Chicago looks awesome 
@jamesbregenzer @TrumpChicago was completed during recession  when most other projects failed  Trump deserves Chicago's praise @BlairKamin 
Dopey @chicagotribune critic fails to mention the ugly Sun Times sign  
Before I bought the site  the Sun Times had the biggest  ugliest sign Chicago has ever seen  Mine is magnificent and popular  
@lifesanthem @TrumpVancouver Good news  1 of the most exciting people coming to 1 of the most exciting cities in the world A great place 
@dreamsoles1 @realDonaldTrump you sir are a true inspiration to me I thank you  Great  thanks  
@GOOD_ggg @TrumpGolf With GOOD service at his clubs imagine the service Mr Trump could give American people as Pres True 
@ep_capital @ReformedBroker @PhilipRucker @realDonaldTrump yo that sign gonna be more famous than HOLLYWOOD I agree 
In answer to your questions about my favorite impersonator  the answer is Darrell Hammond  
People are LOVING the Trump sign on the Chicago building  Big league tweets  letters and calls… 
A third rate architecture critic who I thought got fired—for the failing @chicagotribune likes the building but doesn’t like the Trump sign 
@AWoodyLou: @realDonaldTrump you are an inspiration to us all  If only you would run for President and sort all this shit out  
@stac: Following @realDonaldTrump was one of the best decisions I've made on twitter  Love the way he speaks his mind and no sugar coating 
I told all of the haters and losers long ago that Iraq would fall  take the OIL or get out fast Massive waste of lives and trillions of $'s 
Iraq told us to get out  Iraq is now falling  and Iraq now wants us to come back Don't do it unless we get the OIL  and I mean ALL OF IT 

@EfprestoPreston: @realDonaldTrump Run  Donald  run 
@DbigRock34: @realDonaldTrump run for president  you got my vote 
Iraq is falling apart fast two trillion dollars and so many deaths Bush got us in and Obama took far too long to get us out 
@Mmmkamilla: I have never voted before  but if Mr Trump ran for President  I would love nothing more than for my first vote to go to him  

BTW The Miss USA pageant was the highest rated non sports telecast on the Big 4 networks  Congrats to our newly crowned @Nia_Sanchez_ 

We are what we repeatedly do  Excellence  therefore  is not an act but a habit  Aristotle 


The @GOP primary voter spoke last night in VA 7 & @DaveBratVA7th won going away  Now the party MUST stand behind him Unity Unity Unity 

Congratulations to @BretBaier on the immediate & tremendous success of his book ‘Special Heart ’ Already in its third printing 


@Koonskin:  @realDonaldTrump would make an amazing president  Best ever Sadly  I don't think he has the guts to run  A shame  We'll see 

@SMarkelon: Get this liar out of the White House  @realDonaldTrump for president 2016 He has the drive and business leadership we need 
@BravoFan2014: @realDonaldTrump @MissCassie1230 he has my vote we need an Patriot in the White House again  
@zahmad_a:It is the haste decision of withdrawing troops from Iraq w/o having a fully prepared Iraqi Army  Wrong  they could NEVER do it 
@MissCassie1230: @realDonaldTrump for President Smarter than any man in the USA I agree  thanks 
Iraq is far worse and of more danger to the U S  now than it ever was under Saddam Hussein and this after $2 trillion and so many lives 
@pamplinfilmco: @realDonaldTrump @Jenn641 Can't wait 2 see the White House makeover when Trump is president  Our country would thrive 
@Retrogirl01 He sure has my vote It's time we get someone in there that has a brain A business mind to clean this mess up Thank you 
Eric Cantor's concession speech was ridiculous acted like nothing had just happened  WE NEED REAL LEADERS 


@justalmir: @realDonaldTrump please run for election so my first ever vote could be for you Thanks 
@84Celtics: @realDonaldTrump No House Majority Leader Has Lost A Primary Since 1899  
As I have said  the Tea Party is alive and well and fighting hard for the USA  BIG WIN TODAY 
Tea Party takes down Eric Cantor REALLY BIG WIN 
@AskMrWhitey: @realDonaldTrump You have the finances and the name  And we have the votes    Get on it  Lets make it happen  
What I am saying is that we never should have been in Iraq in the first place  Bush was terrible  Obama is worse Make America GREAT again  
@lovebautistafan: @realDonaldTrump @TrumpToronto @mdamelincourt By far the best hotel i've ever stayed at Mr  D is tremendous  
I told you so a long time ago: Iraq just lost second largest city as their soldiers drop their guns and run  Only the beginning OIL  



@SchwabbieMan: @realDonaldTrump Amateurs    unfortunate but true  True  our leader is clueless 

@_tregun: @realDonaldTrump Iraq  Afghanistan  Pakistan: O's foreign policy (or lack thereof) fails repeatedly  
@shousman86: @realDonaldTrump Mr  Trump please build our Military and take care of our Vets as Commander in Chief This would happen 
@JOEBANNAS: @realDonaldTrump There are no friends over there   you can not trust anybody  They where probably set up   Get our boys out 
@PiersComments: The only strong leader that the Republicans have at the moment is Donald Trump  
Five U S  soldiers killed in Afghanistan by so called friendly fire  What are we doing  
@david_j_roth: I was never one who looked at success as bad  For me  success was always good  I loved it  and still do  Donald Trump 

@alexniekamp: @realDonaldTrump Loving the new TRUMP sign going up in Chicago Thank you

@GamezFrank @realDonaldTrump when do you sleep  Not much sleep for me 

Heading over to the Miss USA Pageant  The young women participating are amazing and accomplished  Competition is very tough  ENJOY THE SHOW 
The man made climate change that our great president should be focused on is of the NUCLEAR variety brought upon us because of weakness 
The Miss U S A  pageant will be amazing tonight  To be politically incorrect  the girls (women) are REALLY BEAUTIFUL  NBC at 8 PM  
@killen2015: If @realDonaldTrump ran for president in 2016 I'd totally vote for him We need a business man to get the economy back on track 
@kathy1453: @realDonaldTrump @DonaldTrump2016 Trump for President  You would make a difference  I think you're great  Thank you 
@DonaldTrump2016: @realDonaldTrump if you were in Washington this country would be in better shape Wow  thank you for caring so much 
@tbrandy100:How about Bush  He lied about Iraq and WMD's  Cost us 4000 lives I agree  I think he was also a terrible President 

No president in history has lied to the American people more than President Obama in fact  it is not even close 
@GeraldBJohnson: @realDonaldTrump I would vote for Trump We need discipline  intelligence  and most of all strength He would bring all 3 
REMEMBER  the terrible 5 for 1 trade whereby the Taliban got back leaders (killers) and we got back a NOTHING  WILL COME BACK TO HAUNT U S  
The same brilliant negotiators that gave up five Taliban leaders for one traitor are now making trade deals with China & others No chance 

@AdverTina: @realDonaldTrump  Would you be aggressive as President  Not aggressive  smart 
@ams_world: @realDonaldTrump Its embarrassing  yet no one seems to know how to turn our country around  A bunch of clueless leaders  True 
@FlightAJ: @realDonaldTrump Are you running for president  Watch 


@tegodreaux: @realDonaldTrump Not on your watch MR  President    100% true 
We have to make the U S A  RICH again so that we can afford to pay Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid and STRONG to keep our enemies out 
@lpgranier: Thank you for coming to Louisiana & bringing $$$ First with your incredible speech at RLC & now Miss USA You rock THANKS 
By the end of this year China will be the number one economic power on earth and the U S  will owe 20 trillion dollars  much of it to China 
@trieuhoang73: What a great golf course  excellent job @realDonaldTrump  My 1st Scottish golf experience was one to remember  Thanks 
@JasonBoyer_29: If Washington had @realDonaldTrump type of leaders  this country would be back on top Thank you and true 
Just toured Baton Rouge  Louisiana GREAT PEOPLE  fantastic place  doing really well  Miss USA Pageant totally sold out Tomorrow night  NBC 
I am in Baton Rouge where the Miss USA Pageant will be shown live on NBC on Sunday night for 3 hours starting at 8 P M  INCREDIBLE SHOW 
The owner of California Gold just made a jerk (fool) out of himself  Just smile and congrat the winner  His wife was visibly embarrassed 
 @AndrewKreig Thank you Andrew so correct 
Will be in Louisiana for the Miss USA Pageant which will be on NBC on Sunday night  Watch Miss Pennsylvania an interesting and amazing story 

@SummersMarcus: @realDonaldTrump always my role model Thank you  



Obama is  without question  the WORST EVER president  I predict he will now do something really bad and totally stupid to show manhood 
“Learn  know  and show  It’s a proven formula  Put it to use starting today ” – Think Like a Champion 
BREAKING NEWS: Obama has just made a trade with Russia  They get Florida  California & our gold supply  We get borscht & a bottle of vodka  


@GleisisSantos Reading @realDonaldTrump 's Think Like a Champion   What a great and inspirational book  Thanks  good luck 
@Ry_Ceo: @realDonaldTrump i always tell people to vote for Donald Trump if he runs for president  He knows the real deal 
@Eriksson: Call it any way you like  but Snowden is a traitor  When our country was great do you know what we did to traitors ” 
@elChucacabra: @realDonaldTrump Obama can strike a deal with the Taliban  but can't make a deal with congress  
@Boycottmaypac: @realDonaldTrump He got the president to show his Birth Certificate He has clout my friend He can really stir things up 
I believe that in addition to the 5 terrorist leaders President Obama gave up for Bergdahl  a great deal of CASH was also given  So stupid 



Congratulations to @joniernst on her impressive @IowaGOP primary win last night  Now all should unite & defeat Bruce Braley this November 

@iCheko_LOM All Mr  @realDonaldTrump is trying to do is wake everyone up to the truth  Loving the tweets  Thank you  
@MikeyGojca @realDonaldtrump speaks the truth and is as successful as he is    must be doing something right  I guess so  thanks 
@_lizzly Nearly anything would be more effective than Obama  @realDonaldTrump is the ideal candidate for this country's restoration Thx  
Obama can release 5 senior Taliban for a deserter but can’t make Mexico release decorated Marine Sgt  Andrew Tahmooressi  Pathetic 
Obama betrays Israel yet again  our strongest ally in the Middle East  He will recognize Hamas  breaking long standing US policy

Chris McDaniel looks like he will win in Mississippi GREAT NEWS and big victory for Tea Party 
Obama never consulted with Congress about a prisoner exchange  HE BROKE THE LAW AND SHOULD BE TRIED  OUR PRESIDENT IS A TOTAL DISASTER 
Are you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence  
Was Susan Rice told to lie about Bergdahl  Obama and his representatives lie about virtually everything  from ObamaCare to a deserter

Rapidly failing @VanityFair magazine hits me for my strong stance against Obama's brilliant 5 killers for 1 deserter trade  Amazing 
@Wolf_Hausmann: What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate  Donald Trump 
The five Taliban leaders released for a deserter must really be laughing and having a good time right now  They are saying how dumb U S  is 
Our President is a great embarrassment to the U S  How could anybody be so dumb or know so little as to make the very stupid 5 for 1 swap

Be sure to buy this month’s @AmSpec magazine  Read “A Trump Card ” my interview with Jeffrey Lord  
Because of our terrible leaders  it is now open season on every American throughout the world  Terrorists are thrilled  
President said we would never leave a soldier behind  How about the 4 who died in Benghazi  
Great deal  we swap 5 killer terrorists for a U S  military deserter  That’s how the U S  negotiates nowadays  
@Taylor_McBath Obama is actively destroying the greatest country in the world  We are going to pay a horrible price for his recent actions 
@Ralphige: Who knew al Qaeda had such good negotiators  Impressive 5 for 1 against the mighty USA @realDonaldTrump 
Bowe Bergdahl walked off the base after he was told not to  Solders died looking for him  U S  should NEVER have made the deal PUNISHMENT  

That the Obama administration didn't know the facts about who Bergdahl was before making the stupid 5 killers for one trade is pathetic 
@MrCurvyWor @realDonaldTrump Enjoyed seeing you on @Letterman You should run for President You would get this great country going again

The U S  cannot negotiate with terrorists  It is a sad and terrible situation for the family involved  but this can only lead to disaster  
@ChazKShand: @realDonaldTrump Run for president We need a leader  not a politician So true

@TrumpGolfDC Congrats to my GREAT members at Trump National DC on our club having been chosen to host the 2017 PGA Senior Championship 
The ring announcers are working hard to justify the Mayweather victory  They should be ashamed of themselves A TOTAL JOKE  
No wonder boxing is close to dead 
Crowd is booing the hell out of that phony decision place is angry and going wild  Fight was not even close DISGUSTING  
The Mayweather decision is a disgrace 
NO WAY  JUDGES SAY MAYWEATHER WON  INVESTIGATION SHOULD TAKE PLACE  FIX  
Fight is over Mayweather lost big but lets see what judges say 
Mayweather is getting absolutely killed 
Floyd Mayweather is being beaten up badly through 10 rounds by Marcos Maidana  but announcers say it is even  TWO ROUNDS LEFT  
The reporter that called Kevin Durant Mr  Unreliable should be fired or  at least  apologize  He is a truly great player and a winner 
There must be a higher standard of accuracy in the media  Incredible that some so called journalists can make up lies and get away with it 

@Double_A2011: Yoo @Beyonce and Jayz On The RunTour tickets are way to high they think everywhere got Donald trump money Not good

 @sethmeyers Seth can't help it he is really trying hard but just doesn't have what it takes  Very awkward and insecure 
@WilliamCarneyII: @realDonaldTrump I couldn't agree with you more  Terrible decision by NBC  Seth just doesn't have it 
Seth Myers is so unnatural and uncomfortable doing his show that you have to feel sorry for him  Bad interviewer  marbles in his mouth

Never make a concession during negotiations that could lead to more demands  Be prudent  It's best to have your concessions predetermined 
Negotiations 101: The best deals you can make are the ones you walk away from   and then get them with better terms

@Drake4444444: @realDonaldTrump I'm glad to see you come out strong against Sterling today  Typical Trump  a strong voice  
@JoeFraga: I saw your interview yesterday & agree 100%  Disgusted how reporters are misconstruing your words  Flat out lies by them

 @jamieaydt Happy Birthday Jamie 
@michaelgferrara I don't agree with you most of the time but people are absolutely twisting your comments to suit their agenda Thx true 
@foxesbA I knew the mainstream media was going to selectively hear what you were saying as I listened to your interview  So did I 

Dopey @ariannahuff should force her reporters to be accurate—if she has that power  
It’s important to listen to what people say  “Horrible” and “disgusting” are the words I used in response to Sterling’s comments  
It is also amazing how comments can be edited to provide statements that are used in a knowingly incorrect manner

@diverojalv: @realDonaldTrump @chrispilz my only concern w/Trump running for prez is that he could only serve two terms Very cute 
@Winger23: Obamacare has ruined healthcare  Everyone I know is having a hard time paying their new plans  It costs too much 
@chrispilz: @realDonaldTrump Would you consider running for pres in 2016  That absolutely could happen  Our country needs help fast 
@pwnza: @realDonaldTrump why aren't you president yet  A very good question 
@wmdavid66: @realDonaldTrump @ArsenioHall It is without a doubt true  Arsenio was a has been that people barely remembered  
@johnrich: One thing about @realDonaldTrump he never sugar coats anything   I'm SURE @Arseniohall is appreciative  as am I  Thanks John 

@tx_shaun: @realDonaldTrump its true  he didn't get his show until after he won the apprentice 
@AlexArancio: @ArsenioHall doesn't mention Apprentice because his ego won't let him  It's why he failed originally and will fail again 
@TarrKoziara: @realDonaldTrump @ArsenioHall The Apprentice has started and revived a lot of people's careers  Very true 
 @ArsenioHall How quickly people forget  but not me You told me that without The Apprentice you could never have gotten your show Sad 
 @ArsenioHall The only thing you don't mention in the nice Esquire piece about you is The Apprentice  without which you would be nowhere 
@PrincessDaytura @realDonaldTrump for president it's reality  he is reality and he is the ONLY one capable of making the necessary changes 
To all haters and losers: I am NOT anti vaccine  but I am against shooting massive doses into tiny children  Spread shots out over time  
To all young (and old) entrepreneurs: Believe in yourself  talk yourself up Energize yourself and you'll energize others  
@HrvstFoundation @realDonaldTrump @SamJabbo The Art of the Deal gets my vote  It changed the way I do business  Great 
@realMikePalumbo Walked in Trump Tower for the first time this week   Gorgeous (as all your work)  Love the Trump experience Thank you  
Entrepreneurs: Believe in yourself  If you don’t  no one else will either  Realize that becoming an entrepreneur is not a group effort  
Entrepreneurs: Another question to ask yourself—“What am I pretending not to see ” There may be great opportunities right around you  
For Entrepreneurs: A good question to ask yourself –“What can I provide that does not yet exist ” 
@SamJabbo @realDonaldTrump i haven't read any of your books yet  which one should i start with  The Art of the Deal is a good start  
Inspiration exists  but it has to find us working  Pablo Picasso 


With autism being way up  what do we have to lose by having doctors give small dose vaccines vs  big pump doses into those tiny bodies

Healthy young child goes to doctor  gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines  doesn't feel good and changes AUTISM  Many such cases 
@GOBNaseem: Do you think your book from 2004  How to get rich can still be a gateway to financial success in today's day of age  YES 
@CherylMossTyler: @realDonaldTrump thank you for stand on child vaccinations  35yr ago 1 child in 3 counties  Now 3 classes in some schools 
@menabazz_: @realDonaldTrump You inspire me  Thanks 
@saladgyrl: @RockChalkSpence Someone I know has a child who had a seizure within minutes of a shot in Dr's office  was autistic after  
@GiorgiMassimo:3 words to keep in mind every day for getting rich You're the best business man  your tips are precious Thanks in advance 
Coach W to his basketball players BE QUICK BUT DON'T HURRY 
@Bossman140: @realDonaldTrump the most brilliant observation you have ever made  Parents should take your advice 
If I were President I would push for proper vaccinations but would not allow one time massive shots that a small child cannot take AUTISM  
@ctsa: @realDonaldTrump when I was a kid  there were 8  Now they give upwards of 31 40  It's an assault on the immune system  
Autism WAY UP I believe in vaccinations but not massive  all at once  shots  Too much for small child to handle  Govt  should stop NOW

@wesbart53: Watched his speech yesterday   pathetic  Carter esque  weak  His delivery is so cautious not to offend  absolutely zero True 
This is the time for the United States to be strengthening all important military components not rolling over and dealing from weakness 
Not good or smart for Obama to be calling Russia a regional power or to mention the concept of a nuclear weapon going off in NYC  
President Obama looks absolutely exhausted in the Netherlands  He is not a natural leader  was never ment to lead it is tough work for him 
He that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else  Benjamin Franklin

@AngelProRoofing @TrumpDoral I've had the pleasure of staying here with my family talk about exclusive service best resort by far  Thanks  


Obama should stop running down the stairs when getting off Air Force One  Doesn’t look presidential and at some point he will take a fall  
I wonder if Apple is upset with me for hounding them to produce a large screen iPhone  I hear they will be doing it soon—long overdue  
Obama must now FOCUS  get his mind off March Madness   and LEAD Watch Russia closely  work hard on the economy and get rid of ObamaCare 
The situation with Russia is much more dangerous than most people may think and could lead to World War III  WE NEED GREAT LEADERSHIP FAST 
We should be building up our military and our missile defense systems to their highest levels ever  Must be very strong to prosper & survive 
I believe Putin will continue to re build the Russian Empire  He has zero respect for Obama or the U S  
Putin has become a big hero in Russia with an all time high popularity  Obama  on the other hand  has fallen to his lowest ever numbers  SAD 
Great advice from my mother: “Trust in God and be true to yourself ” – Mary MacLeod Trump 
Great advice from my father: Know everything you can about what you're doing  Fred C  Trump 
Continuous effort not strength or intelligence is the key to unlocking our potential  Winston Churchill 
President Obama  be cool  be smart  be sharp and FOCUS (no more March Madness)  and you can beat Putin at his own game  IT CAN BE DONE 
While Putin is scheming and beaming on how to take over the World  President Obama is watching March Madness (basketball) 
I don't hate Obama at all  I just think he is an absolutely terrible president  maybe the worst in our history 
We're spending a fortune looking for the lost plane with mostly Chinese passengers  and that's OK but how much are Russia & China spending  
President Obama was able to fool the Americans by getting elected  but not able to fool Vladimir Putin  Too bad for us 
Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again  this time more intelligently  Henry Ford

@CheezitsCat:  @realDonaldTrump what is ur favorite plane  Boeing 757 and Citation X  
Looks like plane may have been found in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Australia  
Lithium ion batteries should not be allowed to be used in aircraft  I won't fly on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner it uses those batteries  
Plane was carrying those terrible lithium ion batteries  which are highly combustible  as cargo  Fire could have started in cockpit  
@Chris_LaPenta: @realDonaldTrump That's why we need you in 2016  
@BrownsMakeMeUgh: It's very important that he fills out his March Madness bracket on SportsCenter while Putin takes over eastern Europe

While I won't be running for Governor of New York State  a race I would have won  I have much bigger plans in mind stay tuned  will happen

Disappointed the @NewYorkObserver article on @AGSchneiderman did not bring up his dealings w/ Shirley Huntley http://bit ly/ODsO0j  
Experience is not what happens to you; it's what you do with what happens to you  Aldous Huxley

Thank you to Jeffrey Lord @AmSpec for his incredible & insightful article this weekend on failing & irrelevant @BuzzFeed 
For the NY State Repubs to waste time  energy and money on a primary—then go against 3 1 Dems—is insane  
Thank you to Matt Boyle @BreitbartNews for analytical & well written piece on sleazebag blogger @mckaycoppins & irrelevant @BuzzFeed 
NY State Republican Party must unify or November will be another disaster  
Internal polling shows that I would swamp @RobAstorino in a NY Republican primary 77% to 23%  But won’t run if party is not unified  
@graeme123s I have that many Trump books at my desk he may as well be next to me telling me I have what it takes Thanks 
@DaveDautel Been following you since your book Art of the Deal   Thank you for your words of wisdom & insights Thx  
 @willweatherford @FLGovScott Gaming in Miami will be incredible—best in world and create lots of jobs and revenue

@amarudacosta: Sadly @realDonaldTrump was correct about South Africa the level of violence is irrepressible 
@DonnieHawes: 14 more days till we at @TrumpDoral & @realDonaldTrump host the WGC  You don't want to miss it 
I wonder how much money dumb @BuzzFeed and even dumber Ben Smith loooose each year  They have zero credibility totally irrelevant and sad 

@fastercarrrrrrr: @realDonaldTrump why are you not running for president in 2016 We'll see what happens 
@SpinningDisk: @realDonaldTrump Ignore them Mr  Trump  Don't waste your time  Sounds like a personal problem for them  LOSERS 
Ben Smith (is that really his last name ) of @BuzzFeed is a total mess who probably got his minion Coppins to do what he didn't want to do

It's not climate change it's global warming Don't let the dollar sucking wiseguys change names midstream because the first name didn't work 
Do you think John Kerry is aware of the fact that they are building nuclear weapons in Iran and North Korea and Pakistan already has them 
Do you believe this one Secretary of State John Kerry just stated that the most dangerous weapon of all today is climate change  Laughable 
@tahanna: @realDonaldTrump hope one day we'll be honoring you on Presidents Day  So nice 
Don't let the GLOBAL WARMING wiseguys get away with changing the name to CLIMATE CHANGE because the FACTS do not let GW tag to work anymore

Entrepreneurs – be tough  resolute & trustworthy  The most crucial time to build your reputation is when you start making deals

Bring in the New Year with style in Las Vegas  @TrumpLasVegas is the place to be  
@SueGriffiths19 Been a bit quiet lately  Told my job is at risk NY any tips to cheer me up  Be positive  do your best 
Congratulations to @woodyjohnson4 and @nyjets on yesterday's very exciting game  
Cover your bases know everything you can about what you're doing  Keep your focus by being well informed on a daily basis  
Ask yourself  Is this a blip or is it a catastrophe  and your equilibrium will be kept in check if/when hard times hit  
Be tough  be focused  There are a lot of ups and downs  but you can ride them out if you're prepared for them  

Temperature at record lows in many parts of the country  50 degrees below zero with wind chill in large area  Global warming folks iced in 
In the upcoming New Year we will focus like never before if we do that we will have complete and total VICTORY in all we do 
We're coming up on the NEW YEAR It is really important that  despite so many stupid decisions being made in Washington  we make it BEST EVER 
The global warming scientists don't want to be airlifted off the ship they are having too much fun and that is too simple a solution FAME 
We should be focused on clean and beautiful air not expensive and business closing GLOBAL WARMING a total hoax 
The rescue icebreaker  trying to free the ship of the GLOBAL WARMING scientists  has turned back the ice is massive (a record)  IRONIC 
@HumorInstitute: I could sleep tonight if you told me we will see @TheRealRoseanne on Celebrity Apprentice before I die  She would be great 
Will be working with contractors at Trump National Doral in Miami today  
@ProudlySA: Thank you for your response we live in a beautiful country & invite you to visit we will host you & show you the beauty 
@ProudlySA As a major fan of Nelson Mandela and the people of South Africa  all of my statements are made with love  Protect his legacy now 

Be on time  Wasting other people's time due to poor planning and thoughtlessness will only leave a bad impression  Think Like a Champion 
It is really too bad that the scientists studying GLOBAL WARMING in Antarctica got stuck on their icebreaker because of massive ice and cold 



Do your homework  Wasting other people's time due to poor planning will only leave a bad impression  Think Like a Billionaire 
O K   Christmas is over  now we can all go back to the wars of life  Focus  focus  focus never accept defeat push hard for total victory 
I hope everybody is having a FANTASTIC Christmas No matter how tough things may seem remember that you will ride it out & go on to victory 
The new Pope is a humble man  very much like me  which probably explains why I like him so much 
Merry Christmas  have an amazing day

@MrsDFRizzo7 good thing about Trump  NOT a snob  A straight arrow w/street sense  Appeals to the masses  a leader all can appreciate Thx  
ALWAYS TRY TO LEARN FROM OTHER PEOPLES MISTAKES  NOT YOUR OWN IT IS MUCH CHEAPER THAT WAY 
SOMETIMES YOUR BEST INVESTMENTS ARE THE ONES YOU DON'T MAKE 
Did you ever not do something that had you done it would have turned out to be a disaster  Never look back  just learn from your experience 
Realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort  You're in charge everything starts with you  
Entrepreneurs: Be ready for problems you'll have them every day  Keep open to new ideas that's where innovation begins  
@TSeay18 Find work that you love you have to be passionate about it to succeed  Then focus and never give up 
@ZootmanTom @realDonaldTrump love your words of wisdom  Merry Christmas & happy new year Thanks

The coolest story is that John Beale  the man who headed up CLIMATE CHANGE for the government  is a proven con man and total phoney ARRESTED

For all of those that think life is easy & don’t want to work  remember: HOPE IS THE POOR MAN’S BREAD

They call it climate change now because the words global warming didn't work anymore  Same people fighting hard to keep it all going

Wow  it's snowing in Isreal and on the pyramids in Egypt  Are we still wasting billions on the global warming con  MAKE U S  COMPETITIVE

The evidence continues to mount against lightweight @AGSchneiderman  It is time for JCOPE and Moreland Commissions to act  



The ill conceived windfarm that @AlexSalmond is pushing for Aberdeen will lose $50 million a year  Only a fool would build it or want it 
If Graydon Carter's very dumb bosses would fire him for his terrible circulation numbers at failing Vanity Fair his bad food restaurants die 
Bird killing windfarm that I oppose in Aberdeen got delayed by at least two years @AlexSalmond forced the failing developers to delay 

Sources inside @AGSchneiderman’s office are saying that they are very concerned with the allegations against their lightweight boss  
My complaint against @AGSchneiderman is a “case study” for JCOPE & Moreland Commissions on everything that is wrong with NYS politics  

Can you believe that the corrupt and pathetic South Africa police force has yet to arrest the sign language guy  Such danger give 10 years 
What a sad thing that the memory of Nelson Mandela will be stained by the phoney sign language moron who is in every picture at funeral 


How amazing  the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama’s “birth certificate” died in plane crash today  All others lived 
I hope you all are looking at the Donald J  Trump Signature Collection of ties  shirts & cufflinks @Macys—great for Christmas & holidays

@fay @aberdeedshire How the Green movement kills: 31 000 excess winter deaths in Britain last year  Each turbine kills 6 pensioners  
Today is the day that ObamaCare website was supposed to be up and working  WRONG website is closed down  a total disaster 90 million doomed 
@Al_Co: @realDonaldTrump Wind Turbines are Ugly and a FRAUD  Remove them  UK is going down the gutter  @aberdeenshire @AlexSalmond 


@TundraSwans: Wind turbine projects are destroying rural Ont  Wind energy is a scam originally pushed by scamster Ken Lay of Enron 



@noturbine: Turbines will also kill more birds than developer will admit to & ruin lives of folks living close & not reduce CO2 


@noturbine:West Palm Beach  FL industrial wind farm scrapped Thousands of birds/bats saved from death @AlexSalmond @aberdeenshire 
First Minister Salmond should stop his fruitless drive for obsolete wind turbines in Scotland he would become popular again @alexsalmond

@RSPBScotland RSPB IS A TOTAL JOKE They went for bird chopping wind turbines in @Aberdeenshire and fought me on bird friendly golf course 
@RSPBScotland Florida Everglades project abandoned after it was determined that tens of thousands of birds would be killed by wind turbines 
@RSPBScotland @alexsalmond  the same man that released Pan Am terrorist for humane reasons  will destroy Scotland with grotesque turbines 
@RSPBScotland must fight to save the massive bird population which will be devastated by wind turbines in @Aberdeenshire  @alexsalmond 
@ThirdForceNews: Should the golden eagle be Scotland's national bird  @RSPBScotland Won't be any left alive wind turbines killing them all 

HAPPY THANKSGIVING EVERYONE  ENJOY YOUR DAY 
I truly believe that our country has the worst and dumbest negotiators of virtually any country in the world  
Can you believe that President Karzai of Afghanistan is holding out for more  more  more and refuses to sign deal  Tell him to go to hell 
Despite the fact that I have had great success with the words YOU'RE FIRED  I do not like firing people  But ZERO on ObamaCare mess no way 
Why doesn't President Obama simply apologize for telling a big fat lie  announce that ObamaCare was a mistake  and deal a really great plan 
US froze $8B in Iranian assets during ’79 Hostage Crisis  Now Obama is giving it back to Iran while Christian Pastor is jailed  Don't do it 
Happy Thanksgiving to all even the haters and losers 
Tell Iran to let our Christian Pastor go and I mean right now  If they don't  there will be hell to pay  
Make sure to enjoy your time with your family during the holiday  It is a special time  Love and appreciate your family  
The $1B failed website is the tip of the iceberg on the ObamaCare  Over 90 million estimated will lose their plans next year

@mckay317 @TrumpTowerNY I will check it out  thanks  
Mr  President  tell Iran to immediately free the CHRISTIAN PASTOR  as a sign of good faith  & if they refuse break off talks big sanctions 
President Obama said  over and over again  if you like your plan  you can keep your plan  PERIOD This turned out to be a total lie 90 mill  
Look at the solution  not the problem  Learn to focus on what will give results  
Set the example  You can motivate others as well as yourself by remembering that you are setting the example  

How does Obama rationalize giving Iran $8B in sanction relief when a Christian pastor is being tortured in an Iranian prison

President Obama is finally getting hammered  even by his most loyal supporters and the press I guess they can only take so much 
New poll  WOW 53% say President Obama is not honest & trustworthy  What took them so long  Go back and look at his house purchase in Chicago

“The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it ” – The Art of The Deal  
Why didn't Obama  as part of the negotiation  free the Christian Pastor Saeed Abedini http://bit ly/18jFbar  
Obama is going to take away over 90M Americans’ healthcare plans but he is letting Iran keep its nukes  Just think about that  
Who would you rather have negotiating with Iran President Obama or Toronto Mayor Ford  My money is on Ford  
Realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort  You're in charge  Everything starts with you  
Don't underestimate yourself or your possibilities keep your focus intact  and focus on the positives  
After settling for a ridicilous 13 billion dollars  J P Morgan's lawyer is critical of the amount of the fine why did they settle then DUMB 
Best book ever on dealmaking (or so they say) TRUMP: THE ART OF THE DEAL  Go get it  and others  Washington you really can do better 
I know it has been many years since our country made great deals  but isn't it about time we start  right now  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
The reason great dealmakers do not OPENLY celebrate a deal  especially one that is not complete  is that it shows weakness to the other side 
John Kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with Iran  Great dealmakers do not celebrate deals they just go on to the next one 
Tom Brady is a good friend of mine  a great player  a great guy and a total winner Fantastic comeback win this is what our country needs 
Tom Brady has done a great job tonight amazing New England comeback  Good game not over yet 
We had all the leverage in our nuclear negotiations with Iran and our leaders foolishly decided to let them out of the trap  WHY  
How much longer are we expected to put up with the world's most incompetent leader ObamaCare  Iran  Syria  bads deals  JUST NEVER ENDS 
I will be on Fox & Friends tomorrow morning at 7  Will be discussing basic stupidity and incompetence  of which our leaders have plenty 

I do not understand how so many of my Jewish friends backed Obama in the last election  He is a TOTAL DISASTER FOR ISRAEL AND ALWAYS WILL BE 
How far has the United States gone down when we are reduced to accept the imbecilic deal just agreed to with Iran  Read THE ART OF THE DEAL 
What a rotten deal we made with Iran  We get nothing (except laughter at our stupidity)  They get everything  including delay and big cash 
They changed the name global warming to climate change because the concept of global warming just wasn't working 
The people that gave you global warming are the same people that gave you ObamaCare 
@mikehaas33: @realDonaldTrump mar a lago a spectacular property  Here with Wells Fargo tonight and hoping you will come say hello I did 
Snow and ice  freezing weather  in Texas  Arizona and Oklahoma what the hell is going on with GLOBAL WARMING  
Get smart on knockout assaults and crime we have to be slightly more vicious (and violent) than the assaulter and crime would end FAST 
The scum that gets high on badly hurting old ladies and others through knockout assaults wouldn't feel that way with a gun at their head 
We are using the absolute wrong negotiating technique with respect to the Iran nuclear talks  Strengthen sanctions until GREAT deal is made 
@WhiteShaunwhite I dedicate my 750 tweet to most inspiring entrepreneurs of our time @realDonaldTrump  @BillGates Thx

Such a nice article in the New York Times about a wonderful developer  Arthur Zeckendorfhttp://nyti ms/I4WCyX  
Thomas Jefferson wrote the Senate filibuster rule  Harry Reid & Obama killed it yesterday  Rule was in effect for over 200 years  
Since the Democrats decided to kill the filibuster  they now own it Republicans should keep the new rule when they're in the majority

For all those sick degenerates contemplating a knockout attack  please remember the late  great Charles Bronson no more crime 
Weak newscasters are asking is there a racial component to knockout attacks  Of course there is and weakness will only make it worse 
If you are lucky enough to catch a knockout assaulter before getting slugged  and you carry a gun  shoot the bastard (teach them a lesson) 
Knockout assaults are the new rage by sick and depraved youth  We better start getting tough in this country and they want to take our guns

How did the NCAA  which is weak and becoming irrelevant  extract such a big & reputation shattering settlement from Penn State  Others zero 
Maybe some of the dead voters who helped get President Obama elected can be brought back to life after signing up for ObamaCare  
The wimps that run Penn State should be forced to resign (and be sued) for the pathetic settlement they made and destruction of great legacy 

I wonder if the Rutgers coach who had the audacity to yell at the player is a proponent of global warming  
Football coaches are no longer allowed to scream and yell at their players because it is discriminatory racist and can be viewed as bullying 
I wonder what the late  great Vince Lombardi would say about the Rutgers football player who says he is being bullied because coach yelled  

@ISaidKnow: AWESOME RT Again  more dead people voted in the last election than enrolled in ObamaCare  Congratulations America ” Thanks

@BretBaier You are doing really great keep it up (of which I have no doubt)  

The same people that built the ObamaCare website used  as the face of the website  someone who is not a US citizen  Incompetent  
Can you believe it—the model who mysteriously disappeared from the ObamaCare website is not a US citizen—she’s from Colombia  
No matter how far down a path you go  if it's the wrong path  turn around and go back home before it is too late  
ObamaCare is on LIFE SUPPORT it will soon be DEAD ON ARRIVAL A bad concept that was imcompetently administered 
President Obama is under pressure from Democrats to undo his lie on ObamaCare  His problem is that such a move would end ObamaCare

If Democrats do not start opposing ObamaCare  and fast  Republicans will have a massive victory in 2014 far greater than any predictions 
A level will be reached where ObamaCare will be so out of control  expensive and unwieldy that the biggest supporters will abandon ship  
Prediction: The disaster known as ObamaCare will only get worse and Republicans will gain far greater power than they have had in years 
Put Kathleen Sebelius out of her misery and lovingly say  YOU'RE FIRED Let her go home to her family and rest  BRING IN TOP FLIGHT PEOPLE 
She is so sad and pathetic that I almost feel sorry for Sec Sebelius  She has done great harm to many people and must be fired  Incompetent 
Just sit back and watch  ObamaCare is such a disaster it will fall like a house of broken cards  The website is the best part of this mess 
When Obama tried to tweak his previous statement on ObamaCare he made it an even greater lie even the Senate Democrats are angry with him

@MsMEGZILLA: @realDonaldTrump I wish you were President But only if you want our country to be great again 
@seancourt: I feel safer knowing men like @realDonaldTrump are around Thank you  

@GOP House has the right bill: “If you like your healthcare plan  you can keep it ” The Senate must take it up on a vote 
The ObamaCare website will cost over $1 5B when all is said and done  Crazy

@duncanrj1969 Thanks  
@Debstermistress @realDonaldTrump when he says he doesn't know  he admits he is not leading  USA a rudderless ship  
So we can spy on our ally’s leaders but can’t water board terrorists  
It’s Thursday  @billmaher is still a very dumb guy just look at his past  
“If you like your healthcare plan you can keep it ” = “I was born in Hawaii ” 

@Andigriffin @realDonaldTrump your Las Vegas Hotel is beautiful too Thank you

Looks like a very good World Series game 
@DannyZuker:  @realDonaldTrump I miss us  Danny  I miss you tooooo 

@billmaher: With the cast from Friday's Real Time and now I'm in Springfield  Mass for standup tonight and Bill  you totally bombed BAD 
How come Snowden and ObamaCare have access to all records and information but don't have even the smallest tidbits on President Obama  
ObamaCare is a disaster and Snowden is a spy who should be executed but if it and he could reveal Obama's records I might become a major fan 
“You're never a loser until you quit trying ” Mike Ditka 
China just called  They want to lend Obama another $1B for the ObamaCare web site  
Via @WSJ: “The ObamaCare Awakening: Americans are losing their coverage by political design ”http://on wsj com/1aStySt  
If Obama was willing to lie about ObamaCare then what else has he lied to us about… 
Four brave Americans died in Benghazi  Administration is still covering up the truth  We deserve to know the full truth  


It is now a FACT that President Obama lied in order to get ObamaCare passed that is fraud and the legislation should be recinded INTERESTING 
@haay_ramiiie: @realDonaldTrump has the best twitter 

I hear @billmaher really bombed in Springfield people were leaving show way early stupid guy 
Won’t be a buyer’s market for long  If you can  purchase a home but remember  I told you this three years ago  
Congrats @NBCInvestigates on revealing that Obama knew millions of Americans would lose their healthcare planshttp://nbcnews to/19OtFRr  
Fact – all the countries complaining about us spying on them spy on us  They just don't get caught stupid 

 @AlexSalmond of Scotland may be the dumbest leader of the free world  I can’t imagine that anyone wants him in office  
 @AlexSalmond –the man who let terrorist (Pan Am Flight 103) al Megrahi go  lost another battle over ugly wind turbines in Blackdog  
 @AlexSalmond suffered a huge defeat by the people of Blackdog  Communities all over Scotland are fighting this loser  
When will @AlexSalmond realize that he's destroying Scotland the most beautiful countryside in the world w/ his stupid wind turbines  
Great victory for people of Blackdog  Scotland  They defeated substation  stopping inefficient & ugly wind turbines @AlexSalmond 

@megrunder:  @realDonaldTrump Is there ANY subject you aren’t an expert on  No  not many 
Maybe if Obama knew too much about the spying it would be worse than knowing nothing but either way it is just another disaster 
I just don't know why some of these NFL teams with lousy quarterbacks don't give Tim Tebow a chance what do they have to lose  
There are so many blatant lies coming out of the ADMINISTRATION healthcare  spying  NSA  IRS  brutally killed Americans WILL IT EVER END  
Does anybody really think that President Obama didn't know about our spying on the leaders of allies around the world not possible 
@Abird95: I absolutely love @realDonaldTrump he is my favorite person ever and inspires me to do so much  Thanks R 
Like your current health care plan  Too bad  you’re going to lose it under ObamaCare  Hope  Change & a 300% Increase in Your Premium  

Contractors can blame Obama admin all day for their $600M failure but both parties are at fault pay taxpayers back  
Sebelius didn't test $635M (probably $1B) ObamaCare website until “a couple of days leading up to the launch ”http://bit ly/HmCTKV  
I don’t know why our allies are so surprised Obama is tapping their phones  Nothing changes

Isn't it amazing that the U S  and NSA can listen to the highly protected phone conversations of world leaders but can't get O's records 
At this point the legacy of the Obama Administration will be  sadly  that of THE GANG THAT COULDN'T SHOOT STRAIGHT what a pathetic mess 
With the $635 million dollar website fiasco  getting caught tapping phones of WORLD LEADERS and so much more  U S  is looking really stupid

Where’s the accountability for the $635M website fiasco in the Obama administration  Heads should roll and officials should be fired 

Why doesn't President Obama call upon the NSA to fix the badly broken website then they could spy on all of the many cheaters & arrest them 
Honestly  whether you're for or against ObamaCare  the 635 million dollar website fiasco is bad for the U S  It makes us look totally inept

No wonder @NYMag is doing so poorly  with an idiot Sr  Editor like @DanAmira  it will only get worse 
@DanAmira @NYMag A terrible statement like that shows how desperate you and your magazine are  You should be ashamed  
Canadians kicked out the firm that the U S  paid all that money to for the failed website  How stupid are our leaders   This is a scandal 
Wow  China's growth accelerated 7 8% in third quarter  If the U S  had half that number we would be the talk of the World need leadership

@JimBou1234: @realDonaldTrump Great job on Piers Morgan Thank you  
@piersmorgan I urge every politician in Washington to tune into CNN and listen to @realDonaldTrump 's advice on how to do a deal  
@piersmorgan Watch CNN tonight as Piers and I discuss Obama  SHUTDOWN  leadership and many other topics of interest 9 PM 10 minutes 

I’ll be doing @piersmorgan show tonight on CNN at 9 PM  Will be very interesting  (I hope ) 

Obama has called @GOP terrorists during this showdown  It’s a shame he really doesn’t think it because then he would meet all @GOP demands  

The fact that we are here today to debate raising America’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure  Sen  Obama  3/16/06 
Obama’s job approval is at 37%  a record low  @GOP & @SpeakerBoehner have the leverage & momentum  Delay ObamaCare for all Americans 
Obama can open the Mall for illegals to protest our country yet he continues to barricade WWII memorial  That’s an absolute disgrace

@JoseConesa01: @realDonaldTrump It is time for REAL change  Donal J  Trump 2016  Obama  you're FIRED Thanks for the nice words 
I'm just so tired of listening to the same old rhetoric and words  day after day  from our President  It's time to stop talking WORK 
Florida Power & Light has disgusting rotting utility poles outside Doral in Miami  They should put in new ones or will be sued

@Jon_dennis82 @Redskins True

President Obama wants to change the name of the White House because it is highly discriminating and not at all politically correct 
President should not be telling the Washington Redskins to change their name our country has far bigger problems FOCUS on them not nonsense 

@Mimi_La_Reina: @fogslifting @realDonaldTrump @Redskins that will never fly They'd have to do the same for the Chiefs  Braves  Indians ect 
My sense is that people are far angrier at the President than they are at Congress re the shutdown—an interesting turn

With the debt limit approaching  @GOP has even more leverage  If they stay united and on message they can win  
“We build too many walls and not enough bridges ” Isaac Newton 
83% of the government is still running during the shutdown while 41% of nondefense federal workers are furloughed  Room for cuts  
Obama is tougher on WWII vets wanting to visit a DC memorial than Iran  He needs to show respect to our vets and not play games  
Government is shut down yet Obama is now harassing the privately owned @Redskins to change its name He needs to focus on his job 
Standing strong for his people  @GovWalker is ignoring the Feds and keeping all Wisconsin parks open  Great 

@TheGINE3000: @realDonaldTrump We need someone with some business sense in the White House  This administration doesn't have a clue

@jacadere: @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Mr Trump is right again  The Republicans need to stick together and let the Dems be blamed  
The Obama Administration has a very important duty to provide a budget and then negotiate OUR COUNTRY is a laughingstock

@joshskaggs @realDonaldTrump stayed in your Chicago hotel last night  Great staff and awesome room Thanks 
@AccountsRS @realDonaldTrump Thank you for saving new york from another Spitzer era  We got lucky 
Obama must now start focusing on OUR COUNTRY  jobs  healthcare and all of our many problems  Forget Syria and make America great again 
Putin is having such a good time  Our President is making him look like the genius of all geniuses  Do not fear we are a NATION OF POTENTIAL 
I said that Eliot Spitzer was going to lose when he was way up in the polls  I fought him when others retreated out of fear  NEVER GIVE UP 
Spitzer and Weiner lost  lightweight Eric Schneiderman will be next he will be challenged in the PRIMARY  He has done a really poor job 
@redellis1: @realDonaldTrump He must go    People like him r destroying our country and our principals Re lightweight A G  Schneiderman 
@kbmc24: @realDonaldTrump my husband and I think you're so awesome We can't wait to come to NYC one day and see the Trump towers Great

@johndoe5210: @realDonaldTrump   I worked for another self made man  Elon Musk  I have the greatest respect for both of you  Thank you 
Weiner is gone  Spitzer is gone next will be lightweight A G  Eric Schneiderman  Is he a crook  Wait and see  worse than Spitzer or Weiner 
Assad hit the jackpot 
Back to work for the President to try and keep some dignity for the office and himself  The so called rebels must be thoroughly confused 
The only reason Obama gave a speech last night was because it was on the schedule Putin is laughing and the reviews have been really bad 

@Airmanfirst: @realDonaldTrump Think Weiner will move to a state that doesn't know him  He should move  better for him to make a new start 
Lightweight Attorney General Eric Schneiderman will be next to lose  He goes after a school with a 98% approval rating leaves biggies alone 
Lightweight A G  Eric Schneiderman asked us for political contributions DURING his investigation of us then sued for $40 million Dopey guy

@Brock2120: @realDonaldTrump I remember when Schneiderman was 2nd in command to Patterson on the D side  Can you believe those two  
Thank you to all of my Twitter followers for helping to defeat Weiner and Spitzer  Remember  in the beginning they said it couldn't be done 
I fought hard against Spitzer and Weiner  and both lost  For a while  when Spitzer was way up  it seemed that I was a lone voice Good power 
@TVreporter: @realDonaldTrump What will you miss most about Wiener  Absolutely nothing 
@MiketheScrew: @realDonaldTrump Give credit where it is due  NYC voters chose correctly  
Wow  Eliot Spitzer has lost great news for New York City 
Bottom line  I don't think President changed people's minds must hope for a lifeline from Putin  a very dangerous lifeline at that 
We will have to see what Russia's next move will be  They may have given him an out of an embarrassing situation or drove into deeper mess 
He is working hard and for that he must be given credit 

Doesn't want to remove Assad worries what comes next  
Making his case in a nice and articulate manner  
Does he look sharp  smart and presidential his hands keep hitting the podium  making a loud and distracting noise microphone too sensitive

This week will mark the 1 year anniversary of the attack in Benghazi that left 4 Americans dead  No answers 
Now Obama has set red line 2 with demand that Assad hands over Syria’s chemical weapons or it will face an attack  
Congratulations to @serenawilliams on her superb @usopen win  She is terrific 




Don't attack Syria an attack that will bring nothing but trouble for the U S  Focus on making our country strong and great again 
Why are we fighting for the rebels that hate us only to save face for Obama

@TRUE_A_Smith: @realDonaldTrump thoughts on Geno   He played great  especially for his first game 
@JonC316: @realDonaldTrump Jags GM stated he would not take Tebow  even if released  Can he go back in that statement    He should 
@jamesshelby: @realDonaldTrump What is your opinion on Tebow  Was destroyed at Jets GREAT GUY should have gone to Jacksonville 
Also  great comeback by the New York Jets  That game was over until a really dumb defensive play by Tampa  Amazing  
@Brock2120: @realDonaldTrump Watch Donald  I'm a huge fan but a huuuuuge Bills fan  Painful loss  A tough one to take

@gretawire: PresObama is not busy talking to Congress about Syria  he is playing golf    go figure 
@josegonzalez_69: @realDonaldTrump You have my vote and I'm a Democrat (Albeit a Conservative one) Thanks Joe  
@FidanizzBig You need both  thanks  

Do you notice that nobody is talking about the many scandals of the Obama administration anymore The Teflon President 
@madrox91: I think @realDonaldTrump should run office for one day  Then maybe some stuff would get set straight  The right way  Thank you 
@ET614: @realDonaldTrump Trump For President 2016 Thanks 
@cobra4748: @realDonaldTrump I just bought one of your shirts for a business trip quality style &value from a name I trust

@Midgespeaks I want him to do a great job but he can't  
@anitaozz2: @Toure @realDonaldTrump Trump will do or say anything  But Toure (why only one name ) is just a very dumb racist bad ratings 
President Obama  do not attack Syria  There is no upside and tremendous downside  Save your powder for another (and more important) day 
Isn't it intetesting that anybody who attacks President Obama is considered a racist by the real racists out there 
@UnabashedProg: @realDonaldTrump @thegroveguru can you imagine serious people comparing modern warfare to a football game  ACTUALLY YES 
@RLSteetle: @realDonaldTrump I'm addicted to your books  Are you writing another any time soon  At some point  there is so much to write 

Speaking of our very stupid war with Iraq  it is totally disintegrating and Iran (with Russia) will walk in and take it over (lots of oil) 
@lucindamac Thank you  but we are dealing with many very stupid people 
@thegroveguru: @realDonaldTrump Could you imagine Bill Belichek broadcasting to Tom Coughlin exactly when and where he was going to blitz  
@ericjgiroux: @realDonaldTrump you need to make a run Time will tell 
@Robertr369: @realDonaldTrump if only Japan had the same courtesy Dec 1941 They should have told us they were coming like us with Syria 
I'm a Republican but not a fan of the last George Bush he also was a lousy President (Iraq etc )  In fact  he was so bad he gave us Obama 
Former President Jimmy Carter is so happy that he is no longer considered the worst President in the history of the United States 
Syria has been given so much time that much of the things we were going to bomb have been moved into civilian areas A polititian's war  
Just watching NBC News where our potential attack is being detailed the exact ships  the stealth bombers  the destinations so ridiculous 
@BretBaier: Thx RT @JedediahBila Well done  @BretBaier Thurs Cable News Ratings: Fox's Bret Baier Beats CNN  MSNBC  HLN Combined  

If Syria was forced to use Obamacare they would self destruct without a shot being fired  Obama should sell them that idea 
When we have big disasters  no one comes to our aid or even suggests helping but we are always expected to come to the aid of others

Obama is not a leader  he's just a campaigner 
Many of the Syrian rebels are radical jihadi Islamists who are murdering Christians  Why would we ever fight with them  

No surprise  Woman being cited by Kerry & McCain on Syrian rebels is a paid consultant of the rebelshttp://bit ly/19pezR7

@robyncook7: It's sad that @realDonaldTrump knows more about politics than our politicians 
I am not angry at Russia (or China) because their leaders are far smarter than ours  We need real leadership  and fast before it is too late 
I wonder how much our leaders have promised  or given  Russia in order for them to behave and not make the U S  look even worse  
Really bad news just announced concerning jobs  Far fewer jobs created in August than anticipated  Interest rates  therefore  to remain low  
We don't have the leadership  including the Generals (who just said the element of surprise does not matter) to attack anyone Cool it  
Did you ever see a situation so ridiculous as our President explaining what  when and where to Congress about a Syrian attack  Far too late 
@vindictivraider: @realDonaldTrump Well quit yapping about and run for office  I like your ideas  DO IT 
@reallLTalk: @realDonaldTrump TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT Thanks  
@autumnallday: @realDonaldTrump I wish you'd run for office  The country needs more minds like yours  Thank you  
@KhalidNasser: @realDonaldTrump In this case  What would you do if you were the President  I'd rebuild the U S  and make it great again 

The terrorists in Syria are calling themselves REBELS and getting away with it because our leaders are so completely stupid 
@JesseGunPlayJay: @realDonaldTrump You're a pussy shut up and stop crying @jayleno show is funny No  Jay is dumb as a rock gets outplayed 
We should not attack Syria but if they make the stupid move to do so  the Arab League whose members are laughing at us  should pay

Russia is sending a fleet of ships to the Mediterranean  Obama’s war in Syria has the potential to widen into a worldwide conflict  

All former Bush administration officials should have zero standing on Syria  Iraq was a waste of blood & treasure  



It will be interesting to see what happens to Eliot Spitzer if he loses the election for Comptroller to very capable @scottmstringer  
I have just lost my beautiful & elegant long time exec  assistant Norma Foerderer  She passed away yesterday – a truly magnificent woman  
AGAIN  TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER  DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT FIGHT THE U S  GETS NOTHING 
@gregfrech: @realDonaldTrump have you seen the video of the rebel commander cutting out and eating the Syrian soldiers heart & liver 
While everyone is waiting and prepared for us to attack Syria  maybe we should knock the hell out of Iran and their nuclear capabilities  
If you look at the horrible picture on the front page of the NY Times of the rebels executing prisoners  you would say forget the rebels 
Tell Congress to straighten out the many problems of our country before trying to be the policemen to the world  Make America great again 
@Whoopsydoodle: @realDonaldTrump god your the best Mr  Trump I like you tooooo 
@Bchipper83: @realDonaldTrump haha I love how you just tell like it is You aren't who you are by not doing just that Thank you 
The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement  Do NOT attack Syria fix U S A  
President Obama put himself in a very bad position when he talked about Syria crossing the RED LINE  Amazingly  now he denies he said that 
@Bchipper83: @realDonaldTrump haha I love how you just tell like it is You aren't who you are by not doing just that 
@walterdisneyusa: @realDonaldTrump you would make such a good president Thank you 
@livin_in_80s: @realDonaldTrump hell yeah Dammit I love the frankness and brutal honesty of @realDonaldTrump It is the only way

@thecarlossegura: @realDonaldTrump do u like Lettermans show  Yes  much smarter than Leno  
@FSUSteve: @realDonaldTrump Why do you think you're so polarizing  Because I like to be it often times brings out the truth 
Is Anthony Weiner a jerk or what 
Jay Leno and his people are constantly calling me to go on his show  My answer is always no because his show sucks  They love my ratings 
@PDGreenwood: I wish I could go on Jay's show so badly Real quote from @realDonaldTrump Real quote is I wish they would stop calling 
@twojacksdetail Send it to me in New York  Doug Thanks  
@REAPEROFTRUTH: @realDonaldTrump u mad because @jayleno doesn't want u on his show  He begs me to go on his show done it many times loser 
@WhiskeysCowgirl: @realDonaldTrump just turned off Jay I can't watch him anymore  running out with the phony high fives he's lost it 
@jp_worldwide: @realDonaldTrump you need to go on @HowardStern to bash Jay Leno  Howard hates him too Howard is right on Leno Jay is over 
@MariaDavidson10: @realDonaldTrump you have more followers than they (@billmaher @jayleno) do  So true  and am hopefully MUCH smarter 
“Appreciate your property  and your property will appreciate for you ” – Think Like a Billionaire 
I hear this moron @billmaher said nasty things about me (hair etc—boring) on the terminated @jayleno show  Stupid guy/bad ratings

 @serenawilliams had a flawless @usopen quarterfinal win last night  She’s a great player and a wonderful person  
Many Syrian ‘rebels’ are radical Jihadis  Not our friends & supporting them doesn't serve our national interest  Stay out of Syria

@ukn96: @realDonaldTrump If two of your competitors were at war  would you let them destroy each other  Or would you back one  
@andrewessex1: @realDonaldTrump @tannermarkboots Just finished 'art of the deal'  Brilliant insight into your mind  thanks 
@atkins4: @realDonaldTrump you realize that is what Iran wants  dont you  You beat Iran in a much different fashion not through Syria 
For all of those fools that want to attack Syria  the U S has lost the vital element of surprise so stupid could be a disaster 
What I am saying is stay out of Syria  
The great GENERALS MacArthur and Patton  real leaders and fighters  are spinning in their graves as we give Syria info & time to prepare  
@BigSexyBDAvis: @realDonaldTrump mr trump would attack Syria or no  No  lets make our country great again as they fight their war 
@BattoulShamsi: @realDonaldTrump I just love ur way of thinking and analyzing things  2 the point  Thanks  
@DavidAGoodman: @realDonaldTrump:How can General Dempsey tell Obama delaying Syria bombardment will have no consequences  He's no Patton 
@NattieBright: @realDonaldTrump If u r so disappointed at Obama why don't u run for president in 2016 Watch 
@jvmesb: @realDonaldTrump is the kind of president we need True

“A big key to winning is knowing where the other side is coming from ” – Think Like a Champion 

China  OPEC and Russia laugh at us  But now thanks to Obama so does Syria  Very sad 


@thobane63: @realDonaldTrump why the hell are you always criticising Obama Because he is doing a terrible  in fact embarrassing  job 
President Obama's Arab Spring is not looking so good right now 
@Trill_Blowa: If the government just listened to @realDonaldTrump this country would be so much better 
@Devante4Liberty: @realDonaldTrump But if we had a Republican President you would say the exact opposite right  Wrong 
Think of it  the Arab League doesn't want to get involved with Syria but they want us to do their dirty work  How stupid 
If the U S  attacks Syria and hits the wrong targets  killing civilians  there will be worldwide hell to pay  Stay away and fix broken U S  
Our country is looking very bad right now

@flljeff: @realDonaldTrump You always Keep it Real Mr  Trump   the truth hurts sometimes and America needs you to run in 2016 
@TarekR: @realDonaldTrump If you ever become president of the US  what would be your first step  Get rid of Obamacare 
@Rizz_Lizz: @realDonaldTrump I am surprised Weiner is so delusional to think that he still has a shot should seek help  
@pantysoaker420: @realDonaldTrump @schulesix3 @JamesFrancoTV james franco is prettier than donald trump But I get better ratings 
@charliemassie: I hope @realDonaldTrump runs for president  For obvious reasons  
@kyleraccio: @realDonaldTrump Donald have you noticed how so many people want you to run  Amazing  I think you will win handily  Thanks 
@_itsTracy: @realDonaldTrump run for prime minster in the uk and first minister in scotland    we could use your help Cute 
@Omaha_Tiger: I realize what a mess we're in by watching @FoxNews   then I read @realDonaldTrump tweets   like a breath of fresh air Thanks 
@JamieeMingg: @realDonaldTrump I LOVE YOU DJT SR FOR PRESIDENT 2016 Thanks 

@ArsenioHall After Arsenio won Celebrity Apprentice he told me  in tears  that I would be his first guest if he got a show  No interest 
@LucyInTheSky61: @realDonaldTrump @53andlex Agree completely Mr  Trump for President Thanks 
@EwudziYamoah: @realDonaldTrump Glad to find you thank you for your philanthropic work  Thank you 
Eliot Spitzer has failed at everything he has ever done  and now he wants to be comptroller  Thrown out of politics and off of TV  CRAZY 
Each time I see one of Anthony Weiner's television ads for mayor I ask  what the hell is he doing just wasting money & time go get a job 

@53andlex: @realDonaldTrump  please run for POTUS 2016  America desperately needs a TRUE leader with common sense Thank you  
@schulesix3: Roast of @JamesFrancoTV will be the best one since @realDonaldTrump OK  as long as mine remains number one 
@mikethoms85: @realDonaldTrump with all due respect  Bush did exactly the same thing in Iraq  You will seldom see me defending Bush  

@tkeller316 Thanks 
In war  the elememt of surprise is sooooo important What the hell is Obama doing  
@libertybellskp: @realDonaldTrump That's the plan  Have you ever seen such a clueless leader in all your life  I am stunned daily  
@bdeal10: @realDonaldTrump you should be our next President  This country would be in much better shape if you would have run in 2012 True 
@SwagDaddyYol0: Why isn't @realDonaldTrump president instead of Obama    That is truly a good question 
We have given Syria so much time and information there has never been such an instance in wartime history  Syria is now fully prepared 
Why isn't the Arab League paying for everything and sending troops  They want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves 
The Arab League stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on Syria  but they want us to attack Are our leaders insane or just stupid 

@mguarino64: @realDonaldTrump How would you treat the Syria situation if president   I'd let them all fight with each other focus on US 
@imanthonyholmes: I've always looked up to @realDonaldTrump  Business and Politics He's the man Thank you 
@rick_huebner: @realDonaldTrump My son Joey survived leukemia  He is is now 13  Thank you Make a Wish and NCCF for everything they did  
It is truly amateur hour at the White House and this is why we should not be doing the war thing right now 
@akmackey So true 
@Illuminati6sep: @realDonaldTrump   you should be President   Save America Thank you 
President Obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly (in more ways than money) attack on Syria 
@BrandiHarmon Good luck  
@Timi_fel: @realDonaldTrump You always have something negative to say about Obama  dont you  Yes 
@BBPACK You have real talent

@iRazaAliShah: @realDonaldTrump Donald you are anti Obama no matter what Obama does  you will take the opposite view  WRONG all on merit 
@dickquinn: @realDonaldTrump Obviously amateur hour at the WH  Obama was unqualified when he ran and remains so  
@danconiapm: @realDonaldTrump he's no Churchill  He might not even be Jimmy Carter 
@PolitixChick: Just from reading his tweets  it seems like @realDonaldTrump could run our country much better than our President right now  
Did anyone notice that Obama failed to get a coalition of other countries to go along with us  He couldn't even get Britain NO LEADERSHIP  
@AveyahDoesWatch Thank you  
@jayneg53: @realDonaldTrump can't say Obama doesn't know how to throw a polite war General Patton would not be happy right now 
@JesseNicholas13: @realDonaldTrump I'm scared for my future  You should be 
Be prepared  there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into World War III  
China is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess  They will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortune & laugh at us 
Obama now just wants to save face  Russia is now telling him don't do it   He waited too long and the other side is much better prepared  
Who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes  Call it the PLENTY OF NOTICE WAR 

Syria has prepared for an attack based on all of our talk they have moved targeted ammunition and supplies to new locations Amazing 
For the first time in the history of military operations a country has broadcast what  when and where they will be doing in a future attack 
The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria big mistake if he does not 

@Joe1sPro: @realDonaldTrump the president of Syria is killing people inhumanly But the so called rebels may be just as bad (or worse) 
@kingsfansouth: @realDonaldTrump I usually agree with you  not tonight  Stop criticizing The President  I will when he makes good decisions 
@jenconservative: @RKDrake @realDonaldTrump I would be totally surprised if the US even HAS any money to spend on Syria We don't 
@jaymiller283: @realDonaldTrump @jenconservative We need a strong minded POTUS in office before we enter into another war  
@kswizzle43: @realDonaldTrump what would you do give a solution vs being so critical     I would make America great again 
@leebandoni: @realDonaldTrump for once the UK has seen sense and not been dragged into this  They were  for once  very smart 
@OneMikex: @realDonaldTrump he's to soft of a president Incompetent would be a better word 
@jenconservative: @realDonaldTrump Not to mention we probably don't have the money to spend on another long war So true 
How bad has our leader made us look on Syria  Stay out of Syria  we don't have the leadership to win wars or even strategize  
If Obama attacks Syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed  he and the U S  will look very bad 
Is everyone seeing how incompetently our country is being run by watching the mess with Syria  Our leaders don't know what they are doing 
The ratings of The Cycle on MSNBC  a sad and pathetic show  are way down  If they fired racist moron @Toure  a truly stupid guy  they live

Pervert Weiner is dead in his race for mayor of NYC but WOW  Eliot Spitzer has dropped way down in recent poll for comptroller  SLEAZE

So  a woman in Chicago  who never had a job  has 9 kids with 7 different men (she is one of many)  These kids will never work  Trouble 
@hrt05hsv: @realDonaldTrump @realDBP You could do it in your sleep and still make more sense than these other morons  Thanks  
@RonHromadka: @realDonaldTrump talk shows are stale But a daily look at the inside wheeling and dealing of the Trump Org  Exciting 
@JOSECZRS: of course @realDonaldTrump would be one of the few to publicly support miley cyrus' racist behavior  Oh  & now she's a racist  
@WCMartzOfficial So true 
@realDBP: @realDonaldTrump A talk show is a great idea  Please make the time sir  The country needs you now more than ever  
@realDBP: @realDonaldTrump A talk show would be the perfect arena for you Mr  Trump  Ratings would soar through the roof But no time 
@cbs397: @realDonaldTrump You should have your own talk show  Networks and many have asked  but I don't have the time  Thanks 
@GoCubbies22: @realDonaldTrump Bought a poster frame from my Wal Mart store today  and the sample picture was Trump Tower in Chicago  Great 
@ZachHeatherly: Could be argued that @realDonaldTrump may or may not be a horrible person  but his twitter is the best Thank you Donald  
@Beliefheals Interesting and thanks 
@Fartlesburg: @realDonaldTrump Do you ever get sad  I don't have the time 
@benfromdallas Thanks Ben  
@AgnesphAgnes I agree  thanks  
I hope everyone read the brilliant article in American Spectator about leightweight A G  Eric Schneiderman  He should be run out of office

@jonareeves6127 Thanks  

What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict  Obama needs Congressional approval  
Congress must protect our borders first  Amnesty should be done only if the border is secure and illegal immigration has stopped

Wow  @CNBC ratings are really low  worst in many years  I guess I'll have to start doing my Tuesday morning interviews with them again 
@tanjas_world Tanja never give up 
The United States needs to fix its own problems  of which there are many  first 
Let the Arab League take care of Syria  Why are these rich Arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack  
If we are going to continue to be stupid and go into Syria (watch Russia)  as they say in the movies  SHOOT FIRST AND TALK LATER 
I wonder what the great generals like Patton  the big M  or Robert E  LEE would have thought about our stupid broadcasting of an attack  
@walaa_3ssaf No  dopey  I would not go into Syria  but if I did it would be by surprise and not blurted all over the media like fools  
@JanusDcjavu: @realDonaldTrump the one who talks much  does nothing Except make 10 billion dollars go get a job dumbass 
@voicelikeariot_: @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost: Why Obama is giving up the element of surprise in Syria Perhaps because he is stupid  
@RonnieDunn1164: @realDonaldTrump @Hunterboss1996 a few billion more dollars  but I'd rather say President Trump than President Gates 
That said  the rich Arab countries should get involved with the Syrian mess  not us We should start rebuilding our own country & military  
Why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack Syria  Why can't we just be quiet and  if we attack at all  catch them by surprise  
I give the President's speech a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10 Not bad but room for improvement 
Why would anyone think Obama would attack Syria the day of his speech in Washington  He doesn't want to detract from his press & glory  
@jamieaydt: One day I hope to be successful & a bit controversial like @realDonaldTrump    keeping things interesting & classy Go for it 
@LeavesOfGrass_: @realDonaldTrump Actually  I think it was factual and right on the mark  You are a vulture sir  nothing more  Thank you 
@bx_bobby: @realDonaldTrump what was racist about that story  The story wasn't racist  just inaccurate and wrong  Bryant is dumb & racist 




@dlhanno64: @JaneyGodley @realDonaldTrump Donald makes you happy   thats good   we need something to make us happy with this President

@SeanMichaelMc: @realDonaldTrump in Chicago for the first time  your building is amazing from the outside (cool color) to the inside  
@curryslap: Hey @realDonaldTrump    your getting bashed by @TheRevAl about the lawsuit RevAl is just conning his way through life 


 @FoxNews legal analyst & former prosecutor @kimguilfoyle destroyed hack Schneiderman’s suit on @FNTheFive yesterday She’s very sharp 
See @IvankaTrump on the cover of @HudsonMOD  View the digital edition:http://issuu com/hudsonmod/docs/hudsonmod_sept13_c2c … 
There has been a systematic targeting of the Tea Party by the Obama administration  Now Schneiderman goes after me  No coincidence  
The lightweight hack Schneiderman told Ivanka that the “case is weak and more  Meets with Obama & then files one day later  
Has AG Schneiderman been extorting his targets and their lawyers for contributions  We will find out  
@Givens1964 Very cool  thanks  
@AaronPha_q Thanks  
@d_murphy13 @realDonaldTrump purely a political move if he met w/Obama Mr Trump please put the heat on this clown show 
I hope the NY tax payer appreciates the millions Schneiderman is about to waste on a small case  I will litigate to victory  

Thug Politics  Lightweight hack Schneiderman meets with Obama on Thursday  then brings frivolous suit on Saturday  
@ElmarosuElvin Thank you  
My @foxandfriends int  destroying Schneiderman’s frivolous suit which he brought after meeting Obama on Thurs http://bit ly/19UrKxE  


@TuleTwilight Interesting 
@MichaelPMulhall @CNBC I don't think he can 

Why isn’t AG Schneiderman going after Democrat Jon Corzine and the $1 4 billion that is “missing ” 
Amazing AG Schneiderman sues a school w/ a 98% approval rating but doesn’t go after billion $ fraudsters all over Wall St  
I really enjoyed doing the show circuit this AM discussing lightweight AG Eric Schneiderman & the terrible job he has done for NY  
Gov  Cuomo's Moreland Comm should be looking at AG Schneiderman shaking down those under investigation/ in litigation for campaign $$$

@TomNocera: @realDonaldTrump You are asking some really good questions  The truthful answers will come in time they always do

@heavyhauler19: @realDonaldTrump Just swat that nat out of the air and roll on Donald Sadly  he's abusing the system 

What did our very stupid & ineffective A G  Eric Schneidean  during his trips to MY office  tell me about President Obama & Governor Cuomo  
After years of long stops then starts  why did dopey Eric Scheiderman tell people in The Trump Org  this case is going away we have no case 
How can an Attorney General ask for campaign contributions during his evaluation of a case a total sleazebag 
Why did lightweight A G  Eric Schneiderman come to my office on numerous occasions begging for campaign contributions  Also  recent asks  
Why is it that Eric Schneiderman is considered a lightweight by so many and has failed to go after Jon Corzine and big abusers for billions  
Why did failing A G  Eric Schneiderman  after years of looking  file his pathetic lawsuit on a SATURDAY afternoon (unheard of)  No case 
Lightweight A G  Eric Schneiderman  who has been a total failure in office  failed to report the 98% approval rating of students for courses 
@nikkio Thank you

With the two wacko perverts Spitzer and Weiner NYC politics has become a joke all over the world  

Spitzer never made 10 cents on his own he worked for his very rich father (a friend of mine who never thought much of Eliot as a businessman 
Eliot Spitzer was a horrible Governor and A G  who ruined many good people and cost the Country billions of dollars in losses (and jobs)

What took investigators so long to interview the pilots of Asiana San Fran crash  WHY NO DRUG TESTS FOR PILOTS they were really off

All I can say is that if I were President  Snowden would have already been returned to the U S  (by their fastest jet) and with an apology 
Snowden is doing great damage to our relations with other countries and U S prestige  China is laughing at us as he continues illegal action 
Snowden is sitting in China and taunting the U S  He is mocking us as a Country  Great time to place a tax on China trade if not turned over

@dblsolo700 Not concerned about them weren't they brutally mugging people in the Park  Go check your facts  

Likewise  the primary victims of violent crimes are in the African American and Hispanic communities  These people want LAW AND ORDER now 
When it comes to violent crime  and if we are going to solve the problem  we must stop being so politically correct must tell it like it is 
Sadly  the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics a tough subject must be discussed  
According to Bill O'Reilly  80% of all the shootings in New York City are blacks if you add Hispanics  that figure goes to 98%  1% white

If @DannyZuker competed against me and won (which not too many people do)  he could win millions of $'s for himself or his charity 
The lawyer I just beat in Chicago was a buffoon but was a lot smarter and sharper than @DannyZuker  Come on Danny  make the bet 
@DannyZuker is a weak and ineffective guy with a long string of failed shows who got his ass kicked last night He's afraid to make the wager

@DannyZuker @AndyRichter Danny  you're not having fun  you are getting your ass kicked afraid to make the deal  
No @DannyZuker   just the opposite  lots of money can go to charity if you have the guts to play the game (deal) 
Remember  @dannyzuker   you are not even the real boss of Modern Family no big $$$$$$'s for you 
@DannyZuker Come on Danny  are u afraid of the DEAL (be careful  I'm really good at deals)  
@DannyZuker Bigger means bigger dummy  you really are stupid  aren't you 
@DannyZuker Another racist remark by you  Danny  are you a racist  
I know you don't like to hear this @DannyZuker but the biggest nights of The Apprentice were far bigger than the biggest nights of Mod Fam 
@ericleebow Five great golf courses with the new Blue Monster currrently under construction

@aaronrupe33: @realDonaldTrump no ones scared of you donald You are very wrong 
@danrpriest: @realDonaldTrump Just out of curiosity  what makes you care so much about what they think  I study cowards and stupid people 
It should be mandatory that all haters and losers use their real name or identification when tweeting they will no longer be so brave 
@BarrieLouise: Lol  What is going on @ForQ2   Why is @realDonaldTrump threatening you  He's afraid to use his real name too costly 
@julesmattsson Wrong  totally proved my case but didn't get damages because the libel laws in this Country suck 
@TheJuice59101 I do  thanks  
@MaasMaasWhatup: Nobody does the Twitter thing quite like @realDonaldTrump  That man engages his critics like nobody I've seen before  T  
@ForQ2 Are you making less than minimum wage  don't worry  the government will protect you  Afraid to give your real name  You should be  
@A11_Seeing_Eye: @realDonaldTrump @DAM615 Does an IQ of 60 count as being smart  No  sadly you are very dumb but probably born that way  

@brandongersh: @realDonaldTrump Why did you go to Wharton did you not get into Harvard  Wharton is better for business than Harvard

@EAWIII: @realDonaldTrump It will make my 3 day weekend to get a tweet from the greatest businessman the world has seen Great weekend

@BuseyFoundation @THEGaryBusey Thanks Gary  it was great having you on the show  may your foundation spend the money well  
In your planning  know how much risk you can take  Evaluate whether the returns will be worth the risk  
If I'd started in business thinking I knew everything  I'd have been sunk before I got started  Think Like a Champion 
Looking forward to being guest of honor at @ralphreed's @FFCoalition Patriot Gala Dinner on June 14th in DC  Flag day and my birthday  
Must read article by @EmilyMiller: “Anthony Weiner is a twit who treats women like dirt”http://bit ly/12Zy1QU  
Memorial Day is a time to honor our nation's finest who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom  God bless them all  

@TishaLewis Thanks  
@resplatt123 Thanks  
Let's see whether or not Chuck Townsend @CondeNastCorp is smart enough to fire Graydon Carter  who only cares about his bad food restaurants 
Mrs  Goldberg  who filed the Chicago case many years ago  is a vicious and conniving woman loved beating her  
Thank you for all of the positive response on my Chicago lawsuit victory yesterday  Most of you saw through the phony age card ploy

@ForQ2: @realDonaldTrump she trusted you  her mistake  you beat her out of her 500K  She was mean and trusted no one  You're easy to beat 
@warrencasselljr: @realDonaldTrump I agree She tried to ruin the good old Trump brand You can not let her get away with it  TRUE 
@PoemTrees: Counter sue for your loss of time if you want  but it might be easier to let it go~ Glad you won   And had justice~ 
@sonnset: @ForQ2 @realDonaldTrump She should sue her attorneys They knew she wasn't going to win with a binding contract  
@darjar14: @realDonaldTrump Congrats Mr  Trump  Frivolous lawsuits are a BIG problem in this country and issue should be addressed 
I loved beating these two terrible human beings  I would never recommend that anyone use her lawyer  he is a total loser 
Jury was unanimous after hearing the made up case against my co  Filed many years ago  she and her pathetic lawyer should pay me big damages 
The so called 87 year old lady was a vicious and skilled investor who was trying to rip me off with made up facts and a blowhard lawyer  
@Chris_McNall: @realDonaldTrump Congratulations on win in Chicago today  Thank you  this woman played the age card and made up a story  
It's important to remain open to new ideas and new information  Keep your door open every day to something innovative and energizing

@MC21701: @realDonaldTrump @jeff_lip is it true that it was your idea for Steve to name his company Wynn  or is that urban legend  I helped 
@Sanfangas: @realDonaldTrump apparently you think you're funnier as well @RealCoachHodge Actually I do  and I don't have writers 
@YouAreNotDeep: @realDonaldTrump Thanks  Professor Trump  Dr John Trump  uncle  for many years at M I T  good genes  I get it 
@SunnyJL52 True 
@mattcyr2312: @realDonaldTrump @Gurning_Chimp @bluejoni Wind power is inefficient and a hazard to the environment  
@RealCoachHodge: @realDonaldTrump has a much higher IQ than idiot John Stewart That's true  and by a lot  
@jeff_lip: @realDonaldTrump what's your beef with Stevie Wynn  I have none  he is a friend of mine 
@Gurning_Chimp: @realDonaldTrump @bluejoni No  YOU hate wind power as YOU think it'll mess with YOUR golf course  That's true also 
@Freesprite2: @realDonaldTrump @bluejoni like your golf course  which they fought tooth and nail And it's setting records  thanks 
@chrisinspfld: @realDonaldTrump Your books and your record is an inspiration to think bigger and do more  Thanks Chris: ) 
@bluejoni: @realDonaldTrump The Scots LOVE their wind power  No  they hate that it is ruining their land (which it is)  
@dmacduff11: @realDonaldTrump What do you think of Mac Miller  Went platinum with Donald Trump song  80 million hits  without my approval 
Scotland is having a virtual revolt over obsolete wind turbines which are driving up energy costs and killing the bird population (and more) 
@MarkEaston777 Keep figthing  don't let the windfarms destroy your property and life 
@DJLoopsFruit That's because I know him he's a lowlife

@DawnieDeee Hello Dawn  
Pervert Anthony Wiener will never be able to get away from his perversion the cure rate is ZERO  
 @VanityFair could come back if Graydon Carter paid as much attention as he does to his bad food restaurants  @CondeNastCorp 
If the great Si Newhouse were still running @CondeNastCorp  he would fire Graydon Carter immediately circulation tanking  


Use adverse events and monumental challenges to make you strong Think Big 
  @Newsmax__Media is one of the top media outlets in the country  @ChrisRuddyNMX has revolutionized political commentary and reporting  
Jodi Arias jury is having a hard time with the death penalty judge just sent them back for further deliberatuon  
Amazingly @AnthonyWeiner is going to run  The cure rate for his problem is 0  Lots of other things will come out  
Graydon Carter is laughing at the stupidity of Chuck Townsend on his contract renewal even he doesn't believe it @CondeNastCorp 
I can't believe @VanityFair would renew Graydon Carter's contract       
       Circulation is way down and all he thinks about are his bad food restaurants  @CondeNastCorp 
The Lincoln Day Dinner last night in Michigan was fantastic  Record attendance and tremendous enthusiasm I loved it 
@EMTgoneNUTZ Thanks Tanja 
One season ends and another starts  Already casting for the next @ApprenticeNBC  Great news for charity $13 million so far  
Very sad that Republican donors were targeted by Obama’s IRS

@leebandoni Thanks Lee 
@Lord_Sugar Much more than anybody knows dopey  much more and it will soon be revealed in detail  
@danielrsimoes: @realDonaldTrump Here in Brazil  we set up a group to see the final of the Apprentice live  Hug and more Success for you 
@john_candy_: @realDonaldTrump shut up he's a lord what are you   I've always heard that titles can be easily bought is this so  
@ToddFouche1 On that I would beat almost everyone 
@GregE_IoM  Only in your weak mind 
@workplayeat Thanks  only the haters disagree 
@CraigHeff I don't  he makes me money 
Sugar is nowhere near being a billionaire and I know  he works for me 
@sarahluvnyc Thanks  
@Subhana_Anwar It's easy  just think of haters as losers with little imagination and even less understanding of success and very lazy 
@CassHorowitz: @realDonaldTrump Im from England  and you're way better then that Alan Sugar   whoever he is 
@Ozziemae: @realDonaldTrump I love that you speak whatever's on your mind  That is true courage  Living your truth  
@sally_lawson: @realDonaldTrump love the phrase the harder I work  the luckier I get great book Donald 
@carlyvowell Tell your friends son YOU'RE FIRED TUMOR 
@DSlagle132: @realDonaldTrump there should be an All Star NBA No Tattoo Team    would there be anyone available  
@JedediahBila Tell your aunt she is terrific 

@omegaphoenix068 Rather amazing  wasn't it 

I'm watching Knicks game I'd bet all of those guys with the terrible tattoos wish they never got them too bad  too late 
Why didn't President Obama just go inside when it started raining yesterday common sense The two Marines looked very uncomfortable & wet  

The LIVE FINALE of @ApprenticeNBC is this Sunday at 9/8C  Watch and see who will be the first ever All Star Celebrity Apprentice  

This Sunday’s LIVE FINALE of @ApprenticeNBC will be tough & nasty  Be sure to watch @pennjillette & @TraceAdkins fight to the finish 

The sexual abuse that is so rampant has  according to generals  greatly weakened our military  They have failed to stop it  
Just in—all efforts to stop sexual abuse in the military have totally failed—in fact  the stoppers have become the abusers  
 @NYMag is a piece of garbage but I think it is very nice & charitable that they employ the no talent illiterate hack @jonathanchait  

@CCV77 Thanks  very nice  
@funnsylvania: When is @realDonaldTrump going to finally get his own talk show  He would absolutely DESTROY the competition Thanks time 
Celebrity Apprentice will be LIVE on Sunday at 9 PM (from New York City) Casting has already begun for next season  
@Dstrick44: @realDonaldTrump @ricksmi54256322 You did run  And you had your ass handed you  Never ran stupid  but I wish I had would have W 
In other words  our military has a very big problem 
Unfortunately with some men when the poison kicks in (not me of course) there are no rules or guidelines in the military that will stop them 
I was never a fan of Bush 2 FOR MANY REASONS  including the fact that we should never have gone into Iraq but once there  kept the oil DUMB 
Our very stupidly run Country better stop being so politically correct or we won't have a Country to run anymore 
Many generals and military leaders are now saying I told you so They say this will have big impact on military strength & national sec  
General says that the Armed Forces will be severely weakened if the large scale rape and sexual abuse problem is not brought under control

@2go2there: @realDonaldTrump Remember that one time you came to @LibertyU   That was cool of you thanks I loved it GREAT SCHOOL 
@NJWineGeek: @realDonaldTrump but Jon Stewart has a much higher IQ  Wrong  Jon Stewart( ) is an obnoxious lightweight with a lower I Q  
Jodi thought she outsmarted the system it didn't work Congratulations to the jury on a job well done Now  will it be life or death  
@hotair25159: @realDonaldTrump lol   Justice for Travis It shows that the legal system is still intact good news

Residential Capital  a company in which Warren Buffett is involved  went bankrupt but that doesn't mean that Warren Buffett went bankrupt 
I'm giving away money 11AM Trump Tower  Be there or be left behind 
I would absolutely kill Jon Stewart( ) in a debate it would be no contest he's not fast enough or smart enough (only obnoxious enough )  
@SportsWalnuts And Jon Stewart( ) is a very little man hiding behind lot's of high priced writers without which he would be nothing 
@rosannascotto: Why are you giving away money this am @realDonaldTrump   Because so many people need help 
@calikal69: @realDonaldTrump what do you think of @billmaher  I don't think of Bill Maher and nobody else does either

The jury in the Jodi Arias trial is  believe it or not  still out  You never know but such a long deliberation could be good for the defense

26 000 sexual assaults or rapes reported in military last year and that is just the number that is reported (many do not want to report)  
Sexual assault and rape in the Armed Forces is a Massive problem that nobody wants to talk about or do anything about the big dark secret

As I’ve said many times before  Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow is highly overrated  
Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow is a total phony –he should cherish his past—not run from it  
If Jon Stewart is so above it all & legit  why did he change his name from Jonathan Leibowitz  He should be proud of his heritage 
What’s funny about the name “F**kface Von Clownstick” it was not coined by Jon Leibowitz he stole it from some moron on twitter

@SiegristA Thanks 
@harry_vickers @DannyZuker @ApprenticeNBC Thanks 
@richardroeper Keep dreaming 
I just sent @THEGaryBusey a check of $20 000 for his charity  Children's Kawasaki Disease   He worked hard and deserves it  

One hit wonder @DannyZuker   I notice you are not disputing all of the failures that I said you had  Let's talk about it 
 @DannyZuker I'm in front of the camera and behind the camera just looked at your picture  you'll never be in front of the camera 
‏ @richardroeper Perhaps one of the worst replacements in showbiz  once you went on it was over Your taste sucks 

Failed show @DannyZuker season 1 of @apprenticenbc had 28 million viewers and 41 5 million watching      
     but you only want to talk about 10 years later when I still win 10PM in all key demos  @DannyZuker 
 @DannyZuker I hear your filmography is stacked with failures  
“Failed show @DannyZuker” I have never heard of you and was told you are a loser after reading your credits I have no questions about it 



Just out @ApprenticeNBC was in first place in all demos during the 10PM hour in the ratings  
Doing Fox and Friends at 7 00 A M  Hope you loved Apprentice last night

Can @pennjillette @lisarinna and @THEGaryBusey continue to co exist  Find out on this Sunday’s Celebrity All Star @ApprenticeNBC  
To be in charge  you have to take responsibility  you have to instill confidence  It’s like being a conductor set the tempo  

Do as I say  not as I do The politicians who passed ObamaCare are now exempting themselves from the monstrosityhttp://politi co/ZlVTze  
House Republicans should be doing everything possible to defund ObamaCare  Instead Leadership is funding ithttp://politi co/13xhe8h  
@frankibe I certainly did in spades  
@afolasoji So true  
@DbagsLoveMe I will  thanks 
We need another Bush in office about as much as we need Obama to have a 3rd term  No more Bushes

@_Hub__: @realDonaldTrump: Grew up in family business at a time when passion & competitiveness were the norm  We have lost that Trump drive 
The mother of the Boston killers (not suspects) says her boys are totally innocent and were set up I can see the 14 year long defense now 
Lance Armstrong just got sued by the Federal Government they want their money back I told you so What was he thinking when he did that int  
@CindyKempl: @realDonaldTrump : Mr Trump  I personally enjoy your tweets Some are very informative Thank you for your words of wisdom 
Scotland does not have free press  even when you are just stating the facts it's crazy

@Mimekiller: @realDonaldTrump this from the guy who advocated freedom for mike Tyson  Oh  I guess I'm not a racist 
@WLynton: @realDonaldTrump Why don't you just block the morons that try annoy you  They make me feel even smarter not worth the effort 
@WeskusOuma: @realDonaldTrump What other attacks  Read the transcripts etc  
@coolboybrand: @realDonaldTrump they were wildin   they were creating a nuisance  and they were viciously attacking and robbing people  
@mtomassetti22: @realDonaldTrump so should the makers of this documentary be fired  No  but they should state the true facts no angels 
@Bostonred: @realDonaldTrump Where is the evidence   All over the place 
@coolboybrand: @realDonaldTrump the point of the documentary is that they were innocent they were attacking innocent people in the Park   
@Fun_Foy: @realDonaldTrump Didn't some other guy admit to actually committing this brutal crime  Yes  but they committed other attacks 
@RamboFo Great 
@RebeccaErin_ They were viciously attacking other people in the Park nice guys  
I have many great people but also an amazing number of haters and losers responding to my tweets why do these lowlifes follow nothing to do

@SCardamenis: @realDonaldTrump @craigdevlin @11sheila11 Jon Stewart is MUCH smarter than you  Jon L isn't even close 
@SupadupaNycee: @realDonaldTrump but they didn't do it you wished death on innocent children who were brutally attacking people in Park 
@Davyshanks: Advertising Standards Authority has ruled @realDonaldTrump anti windfarm ad misleading Not misleading  very truthful 
The Central Park Five documentary was a one sided piece of garbage that didn't explain the horrific crimes of these young men while in park 
@bitchforshort Victim never died so they would not have been given death penalty but did you see what these innocent boys were doing  
@Davyshanks: Advertising Standards Authority has ruled @realDonaldTrump anti windfarm ad misleading  Political ruling to save joker Salmond 
@GerhardM_com Perhaps  but the Country is in really big trouble I do love real estate though (and am seriously good at it)

@GinaCHaley They devalue everything  stupid 
@penguin_rob like ugly  bird killing wind turbines 
The Chinese talk of climate change and carbon footprint but don't clean up their factories but they sell us the equipment to clean up ours 
Wrong  used to be called global warming and when that name didn't work  they deftly changed it to climate change because it's freezing 
@11SHEILA11: @realDonaldTrump Why dont you just get in there and run for President  you got all our votes Thanks 
@HelmJoshua Wind turbines will quadruple your electric bills and destroy the value of your home  Lot's of chicken soup however bird kill

Did the Boston terrorists register their guns  No  Another example of why gun control legislation is not the answer 
The dying @VanityFair’s circulation has “dropped” & its newsstand sales have “plummeted by 20 1 percent”http://bit ly/zaCBlK  
 @AlexSalmond  don’t worry  my ad will be shown across the world and it is highly accurate 
This past Sunday’s All Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC continued to win the key demographic of adults 25 54  An amazing run 
I’ve always been a fan of Steve Jobs  especially after watching Apple stock collapse w/out him – but the yacht he built is truly ugly

If your enemies end up liking you it’s because they beat you  You want their respect  not their friendship  

Next time you are waiting in an emergency room remember the Boston killer was rushed to intensive care within minutes of capture  

Will Barack Obama personally read the Boston terrorist his Miranda Rights  
@MarkkCole Happy Birthday Mark  
 @THEGaryBusey survives another week of All Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC  Gary is shifty and playing to win  
In light of Boston  immigration legislation will be much harder to get

Me  by a lot 
@Doctor_Trey: @realDonaldTrump I say if Obama is so set on universal background checks  we run a background check on him  Very interesting 
Will be doing Fox and Friends at 7 A M  (in 20 minutes)  

@jbailey1987 Yes we can oh foolish one  terrorists should not have the right to remain silent 
@Shootar401: @realDonaldTrump You need to run for President and get this country back on the right track Trump 2016 Thank you 
@angrycrank: @realDonaldTrump You are a terrible human being  That's only because you don't know me 
My ties and shirts are doing very big numbers @Macy's  beyond my wildest thoughts Thanks @GoAngelo and the rest of the losers for mentions 



Looking forward to @THEGaryBusey's book of Buseyisms 









I hope you are watching the Apprentice   tonight's show is great and Brett Michaels is back 
Everybody loves @bretmichaels He’s a great champion and this is where he should be  He agrees 

 @TraceAdkins presents the NJ Coast Red Cross a $40 000 check for Sandy Relief  You can tell he’s very pleased about that & rightly so  

What do you think of water boarding the Boston killer sometime prior to allowing our doctors to make him well  I suspect he may talk 
Make the Boston killer talk before our doctors make him better  Once he is well he will say  speak to my lawyers  
Don't forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9pm   you will love it 
I don't know how Al Michaels could have been drunk and arrested on Friday night if he was totally sharp on Saturday morning  
Great sportscaster Al Michaels  a friend of mine  played golf with me on Saturday morning at Trump National  LA  He was in perfect shape 
If the Boston killer applies for Obama Care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand 
NO MERCY TO TERRORISTS you dumb bastards 
Can you imagine the Boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms  legs and worse 
Bullshit Pop gave me knowledge and a relatively small amount of money (split between brothers and sisters) and I built it into over 9 bill  
@bracybuilders: @realDonaldTrump just a playboy 
@CoachClintSwan Tell me  what were they doing in the Park  playing checkers  
Watch Gary B tonight on Celebrity Apprentice some really crazy things happen 
Getting back to the nicer and more normal parts of life  Celebrity Apprentice is great tonight on NBC at 9  It will be a full two hour show 
@ajbarker50: @realDonaldTrump do you try to make everything about you  YES 
@NextLevelStoner Great 
You are right  the media is always offending Donald Trump they have no limits but they will do anything not to offend the Boston killer 
I know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually I'm a very compassionate person (with a very high IQ) with strong common sense 
Didn't the Boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away  We are not dealing with an innocent baby here DEATH 
When the stupid people start feeling sorry for the Boston killer and want to release him and give him medals  remember the killings maimings 
I hate when the news media  so afraid to offend anyone  always refers to the BOSTON KILLER as the suspect   
The shirts and ties at Macy's are so good beautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piece l kicked his ass 
I just won a big Court decision (N Y  Post) against some character who claimed I owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties  
Oh no  they are worried that they didn't read the Boston killer his rights and he may have a good legal argument  12 year case to finish  t 
@JoeTran19: @realDonaldTrump how do u feel about Marco Rubio  Drinks too much water

Should be public execution for all to see you will end this bullshit fast 
@The_INDYpendent: @realDonaldTrump Maybe Anthony Weiner can serve as editor in chief But then @CNN would become X rated 
Get ALL the info  then quick trial  then death penalty for the Boston killer of innocent children and people Do not be kind  

 @CNN should stop apologizing for the mistake they made the other day & get back to reporting 

@MarlboroStan You've got it mixed up  Chechnya is not the Czech Republic  
Lots of comments—Do you really believe these two brothers operated alone without influence of others  
The @FBIPressOffice  police & others are doing an amazing job  How genius was it putting together that tape  
These Tsarnaev brothers did not work alone  They had help and assistance from other cell members  Be vigilant and on the lookout

@NYCJennie: @realDonaldTrump would you mind retweeting this flier please  You could help me save 4 year old Jayden's life Go Jayden 
We must change the laws of our land and seek fair but rapid trials for the perpetrators of terrorist acts (Boston) with harsh punishment 
My heart goes out to the people of Boston on this terrible day

@dolliemjs02: @realDonaldTrump I liked Donald Trump on The To Night Show with David Letterman Thanks 
South Korea must in some form pay for our help the U S  must stop being stupid

Where is the President  It is time for him to come on TV and show strength against the repeated threats from North Korea and others  
The only American who has met with the North Korean man child is Dennis Rodman  Isn’t that frightening and sad  
China controls North Korea  So now besides cyber hacking us all day  they are using the Norks to taunt us  China is a major threat

China is pushing North Korea 
When is South Korea going to start paying us for the massive amounts of money we are spending to protect them from the North  
Our President must be very careful with the 28 year old wack job in North Korea  At some point we may have to get very tough blatant threats

No  I'm saying that the World is paying the price for China's pollution while they make a fortune with their dirty factories Very sad  
@KimStagliano: @realDonaldTrump When will NYT write about vaccine damage and its price  3 girls w autism here  Mr  Trump  They should Kim 
Major article in New York Times today discusses the cost of environmental damage in China and how it is RAPIDLY GROWNG Rest of World pays  
China is the biggest environmental polluter in the World  by far  They do nothing to clean up their factories and laugh at our stupidity 
We have tremendous economic power over China if our leaders knew how to use it  which they don't China's economy would collapse without us  
@SullyThinks: why is @realDonaldTrump not the president of the US right now  A very good question 
@thejbrain: @realDonaldTrump Very well said  The United States needs people like you to show what truly leadership means So true 
@kaiser1859: @realDonaldTrump what is the solution Mr Trump  LEADERSHIP 
What do we get from our economic competitor South Korea for the tremendous cost of protecting them from North Korea  NOTHING 
North Korea is reliant on China  China could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders  

@tonyantoine321: @realDonaldTrump Great advice  Yesterday  I listened to your audio book Think Big for the 2nd Time  Great

@NYMag New York Magazine sucks lifeless and dead one of the most boring out there  Get it now  it won't last long 

Adam Moss  editor in chief of @NYMag is quickly losing his reputation in that @NYMag has become so boring and so irrelevant  
Employees of @NYMag should have their resumes updated  It is very boring & will die in the near future  How much are they losing now  

   At the same time  go through a worst case scenario but keep it short  Focus on your goal—look at the solution  not the problem  
Practice positive thinking—this will keep you focused while weeding out anything that is unnecessary  negative or detrimental

Sometimes we do things to build up experience and stamina to prepare  but it's to prepare us for something bigger  
Many of @TigerWoods’ ‘friends’ were quick to abandon him in his time of crisis  Now Tiger knows who he can count on  
Many people look at successful people & don't see anything but the end result  They don't see all the work that went into getting there  
When somebody challenges you  fight back be tough 
When someone can discourage you  you probably aren't determined enough  Be resolute  That's what it takes to get things done  


@SeanHooligan6 @AlexSalmond This is from someone who knows they are a disaster  


   and now Alex Salmond pushes ugly turbines

Celebrity Apprentice on CNBC tonight at 9  
The @CelebApprentice will be broadcast tonight on @CNBC at 9 PM  
Haters  stop saying I went bankrupt  it is not so  I never went bankrupt    
    but like many other great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage  
For the haters  out of hundreds of deals or transactions  I have used the bankruptcy laws 4 times in order to cut better deals  
Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool    
    Icahn  Kravis  Apollo and most others but nobody says they went bankrupt 
People buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals    
    It is very effective and a commonly used business tool  
Why do the losers & haters always say I wear a “wig” when they know I don’t  Like it or not  it’s all mine—just ask Barbara Walters

Amnesty is suicide for Republicans Not one of those 12 million who broke our laws will vote Republican Obama is laughing at @GOP  
 @RNC report was written by the ruling class of consultants who blew the election  Short on ideas  Just giving excuses to donors  
One of the most obvious lessons on @ApprenticeNBC is for the candidates to learn to think quickly  Think Like a Champion 
Does anyone remember the fight @mcuban had w/ the referee—he was weak & pathetic—a non athlete trying to live life thru his players  
Why do shows have @ananavarro—Ntl Hispanic Chair for the losing McCain ’08 & Huntsman ’12  She’s a loser who doesn’t deliver votes

 @SarahPalinUSA did a great job @CPACnews  Much of what she said was plain old common sense  
 @hardball_chris became a super liberal Obama fan only because he must need the money and on @MSNBC that’s the way it is  

 @ErinBurnett should have stayed at CNBC—she was never smart  but people liked her  @OutFrontCNN Jeff Zucker’s got problems 
For beauty and flight  I’ll take the @Boeing 757 over the @Boeing 787 any day 
l still think @Boeing should just bite the bullet & get rid of the new batteries in the 787  Those batteries will always be a problem 

 @ErinBurnett’s @OutFrontCNN ratings are so pathetic  she even loses to @hardball_chris at 7PM which is replay of 5PMhttp://bit ly/Ymi1s7  

I don’t like seeing the Pope standing at the checkout counter (front desk) of a hotel in order to pay his bill  It’s not Pope like

   Those stupid people bought @mcuban's company (of which he owned a piece)  
There’s a reason @mcuban’s partners can’t stand him and on top of that  the team sucks

Does anyone agree with Marilu that Gary  while 'adorable'  is a distraction

That's an interesting talent that Marilu possesses 
Next she says she's being set up by Omarosa to fail    is somebody confused

My 757 is incredible I think the teams agree on that  
Will Team Power be able to withstand Omarosa as PM  Smooth sailing is not expected  
Will Plan B miss Trace  
Firing Bret was a tough one for me but Omarosa doesn't seem to mind  
Omarosa always promises and delivers high drama    
Trace and his team raised an amazing amount of $  Looks like a good season for charities  
There's definitely no love lost between Piers and Omarosa

   Brande was also smart in not bringing Omarosa to the boardroom  
Brande would have been fired immediately if she didn't raise $132 000  a really large sum  Bret  on the other hand  raised very little

Over the years  I've discovered that for a brand to build  the people surrounding it have to work exceptionally well together  
One good aspect of the Obama depression is that it will separate the winners from the losers  If you can make it now  you deserve it 
Remember  no one ever said success was easy Good luck doesn’t come overnight But if u work hard & love it  u will find success & luck

Karl Rove’s ads are the worst in political history 
Karl Rove’s stupid ad made Ashley Judd hot—now everybody is talking about her  
Ashley Judd has just thanked Karl Rove for all the attention he has given her—unreal —how stupid can we get  
If Mitch McConnell wants to win his election  he’d better get rid of jinxed Karl Rove and fast    
    Rove’s ad campaign has made Ashley Judd a totally credible candidate  Be careful Mitch 
How come nobody mentions that the Nielsen Ratings of the Apprentice  after 12 seasons as shown by Howard Stern totally blow away

Country music star @TraceAdkins returns to All Star @CelebApprentice  Competing for @RedCross  Trace is great 
I will be on @LateNightJimmy tonight  Always have a good time with @jimmyfallon  Now we know he will get high ratings tonight  
One of the reasons  I assume  I was inducted into the @WWE Hall of Fame is that Vince McMahon and I have the all time highest ratings    
    and pay per view records with “Battle of the Billionaires” in Detroit  It was a wild day 
It is a great honor for me to be inducted into the @WWE Hall of Fame  This will take place on April 6

When employees are working at home they can never have the same cohesivness as working together as a group    
    Also  if they’re at home who the hell knows what they’re doing (a second job maybe)  
Now I know that Yahoo is in good hands  It took great courage for @marissamayer to take away the right of employees to work at home

Our leaders are terrible  The government spends over $50B a day  It can’t find cuts for less than 2 days of spending  Sad 
The countdown is on  The 13th season of All Star @ApprenticeNBC premieres this Sunday March 3rd at 9PM EST on @nbc  Big 
All Star @ApprenticeNBC features the return of @latoyajackson  La Toya is tough  smart and a super competitor  Watch out 
The $85B sequester is just 2% of Obama's $3 5T record deficit spending budget  Our leaders are ruining our children's future  

Obama is making speeches excoriating the Republicans  and they never answer back  Why aren’t they fighting

@JMarkTiller Thanks  
@RPMNANA Thanks  good question/good point  
@bethosborne14 Thanks  
@JUrciuoli19 I will  
@anchantra Thanks the big question is why 
 @MarissaMayer is right to expect Yahoo employees to come to the workplace vs  working at home  She is doing a great job 
An individual  whose whole career is trying to take down successful celebrities with nonsense campaigns  has turned his attention to me      
   So far  he has been a complete failure at doing so  He should read The Art of the Deal and use his energy to focus on a new career  
The media is so in the tank for Obama that it is amazing—the funny thing is  he can’t stand them 
Speaker John Boehner  who I like  should never have agreed to raise taxes because the Republicans got absolutely nothing for it 
Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool    
    Icahn  Kravis  Apollo & most others—but nobody says they went bankrupt 
People buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals   
     It is a very effective & commonly used business tool  
@RoxanneQuintana Thanks Roxanne  
@dynomike3 Hi Mikey work hard and good luck  
@jaderomaine Thanks and good luck 
@agrclemsonfarmn Thanks Al  
@JUrciuoli19 Very good 
Whenever one of the morons say I wear a wig  stop reading because they have no credibility & just hate

Last night William Shatner had more airtime than any winner  It should have been called the William Shatner show

By popular demand  I will be tweeting on the very tainted Academy Awards tonight 
I'm saying that the Tea Party  perhaps by another name  will soon have another big moment and will be a major factor in victory 
Why didn't movie Lincoln use Ford's Theater for big scene instead of the stage of an unrelated theater  
Big response to my Tea Party statement remember they were never fully energized by Romney campaign and will have far more power with time  
Republicans better start listening to and respecting the Tea Party

Immigration reform really changes the voting scales for the Republicans—for the worse 
Re: immigration  Do the Republicans not realize that Dems will get 100% of 11 million votes no matter what they do  
Again  immigration reform is fine—but don’t rush to give away our country  That’s what’s happening 
Had a great time on the @HowardStern show this morning—he will and should never change

One positive from last week for Lance was that everyone was focused on Manti Te'o Why did Lance do that interview  

Republicans are always worried about their general approval  With proposing to 'ignore the debt ceiling' they are ignoring their base  
The worst negotiators in history (otherwise known as Republicans) have just offered to suspend debt ceiling for four months  Pathetic

@chididdy57 @lancearmstrong Well  he's now paying a big price 
Part of Obama’s new found confidence is that the Republicans aren’t using their power of ideas properly or effectively  
Obama’s speech indicates he wants to change this country as we know it wow  he really feels emboldened  
If the Republicans need a chief negotiator I am always available or can recommend some really good ones 
Republicans  don’t extend the debt ceiling—make the great deal now

@gigigriffin @Deadspin They are ungracious losers 
@PatCardinal Thanks  
@ISHIMWEPatrick @BuzzFeedPSA Thanks Patrick a great compliment  
 @Deadspin’s disgusting response will teach me & others not to be nice anymore—a sad lesson  
 @Deadspin will never make it—they don’t understand graciousness or money—and best guy is leaving  
Dummies @Deadspin had their big payday taken from them by others in the media  
 @Deadspin guys are total losers—they had their story stolen right from under their bad complexions—other media capitalized 
Alabama people are saying their team has real football & real girlfriends—not good for Notre Dame—but they’ll be back 
I still say Te'o did this in order to get sympathy for the Heisman vote—thankfully he did not win  
Te’o’s imaginary girlfriend is one of the great cons of all time—or he’s very stupid  
The interview was great for @Oprah and terrible for Lance Armstrong 
 @Oprah was great amazing that she got Lance Armstrong to totally destroy his life  Why did he ever do that interview  
Lance Armstrong did himself great harm last night  Lawsuits & failure will follow him 
@tman99us @_KatherineWebb That's Shaquille O'Neal's shoe  



All time hit leader Pete Rose should now be in the Baseball Hall Of Fame  He has paid his penalty 
 @Boeing stock went way down because of 787 so I just bought stock in @Boeing great company 
The interview with Oprah will cause Lance Armstrong huge legal and financial problems sometimes it is better to go into a corner and hide  
I'll bet Lance Armstrong wishes he didn't do the interview with Oprah he's saying to himself what was I thinking  
 @HBO should fire @BillMaher and bring back @DennisDMZ someone that is actually funny  
 @BillMaher’s show is great for helping me get to sleep better than Sominex  
 @BillMaher needs to cut back on the pot  and maybe he will stop making offers he can’t afford  
Dumbass @BillMaher has still not given me the 5 million he committed to charity we just presented him with a demand notice  
Brent Musburger did himself a great favor by saying what everyone was thinking he is much more popular now than before  
 @ESPN’s apology(Brent Musburger) was a disgrace to broadcasting stop being so politically correct 
IMO Manti Te’o was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the Heisman Trophy  
Can it just be new age that Manti Te’o fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax  
Not believable that Manti Te’o was in love for one year with a girl he never met she then died  He is either very stupid     
   or mentally troubled (or a con)  
Congratulations to Tom Scocca and Timothy Burke of @Deadspin for exposing the Manti Te’o fiasco  

Look  I have always liked Lance Armstrong I just hated what he did to himself  including recently  His life will now be hell  
Lance Armstrong made a really big mistake by opening up to Oprah  I’ll bet he wishes he had the chance to do it over again  
Lance Armstrong was given very very bad advice 
Journal News readership is already down 50 percent over the years  
If everybody sued the Journal News for revealing their info (guns) paper would go out of business

We were led to believe that Jeep would manufacture in U S  and sell to China—like China does to us

Lance Armstrong’s liability & lawsuits against him have just increased tenfold—his lawyers will be very happy—lots of fees 
Lance Armstrong is having a breakdown  What is he doing—his life is now officially over

I can’t believe @Denver_Broncos allowed final touchdown—dumbest defensive play I have ever seen in football

This ‘deal’ @RNC voted for has $41 in tax increases for every $1 in spending cuts  It is pathetic  Obama is laughing at them  
Make sure you realize that this ‘deal’ is only a stop gap measure Obama will be looking to raise even more taxes in the coming negotiation   
   Remember I told you so  
Obama's deal raises taxes on 77% of national households  With Obama Care taxes kicking in now  everyone will be paying for his 2nd term

My @foxandfriends interview from Monday discussing Obama’s tone  going over the curb and Republican debt ceiling cardhttp://bit ly/Ug9mEi  
Does any Republican have the ability to negotiate  
This is a terrible deal for the country and an embarrassment for Republicans 
Maybe Boehner will stop this one sided deal in the House   I hope so 
What is Mitch McConnell thinking    make the big deal 
I am a Republican   but the Republicans may be the worst negotiators in history 
Obama and the Democrats are laughing at the deal they just made   the Republicans got nothing 
Happy New Year everyone   it will be an interesting one 
Republicans have all the cards   but they just don't know it

Brian  if I'm well past the last exit to relevance how come you spent so much time reading my tweets last night  @NBCNightlyNews 
Brian Williams was never a smart guy but always passes himself off as such  People will learn the truth @NBCNightlyNews 
Brian  I hope @NBCNightlyNews isn't paying you too much look at what's happening to nightly news  
Brian Thanks dummy I picked up 70 000 twitter followers yesterday alone  Cable News just passed you in the ratings  @NBCNightlyNews 
The voting booth process was a total disaster—it could and should be much better and more efficient—tremendous room for error 
This was the Republicans election to win  @MittRomney is a good man but he just never connected with the people  
 @bwilliams wouldn't you love to have my ratings  
The only thing more boring than @bwilliams newscast is his show Rock Center which is totally dying in the ratings—a disaster 
 @bwilliams knows that I think his newscast has become totally boring so he took a shot at me last night  



House of Representatives shouldn't give anything to Obama unless he terminates Obamacare  
Hopefully the House of Representatives can hold our country together for four more years   stay strong and never give up 
The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy  
Our nation is a once great nation divided 
Our country is now in serious and unprecedented trouble   like never before  
This election is a total sham and a travesty  We are not a democracy 
Lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice The world is laughing at us  
We can't let this happen  We should march on Washington and stop this travesty  Our nation is totally divided 
Well  back to the drawing board 
@dionnewarwick thanks for your nice statement on Access Hollywood  You are a great person and talent   I adore you 
Truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains to bring it to light  George Washington 
Whoever wins today  remember that tomorrow we still have a country struggling  Our work is not done until America is strong again  
 @MRbelzer is a stone cold loser with no talent why did they ever put him on Law and Order  
I love show Law and Order but the @MRbelzer casting is the worst ever  No talent unwatchable 
I have had the pleasure of getting to know @AnnDRomney & @MittRomney this past year  They love America  Let's push them over the top today  
Do we still want a President who bows to the Saudis and lets OPEC rip us off  Make America strong  vote for @MittRomney  
The federal gov  has handled Sandy worse than Katrina  There is no excuse why people don't have electricity or fuel yet  
 @ABFalecbaldwin Alec it's not science  it's a con read the e mails  
The federal gov  has handled Sandy worse than Katrina  There is no excuse why people don’t have electricity or fuel yet  
@Tappersong Thanks Gary  
Obama thinks he can just laugh off the fact that he refuses to release his records to the American public  He can't  

If you experience any harassment or heckling at the polling places from Obama supporters  make sure you report it immediately  

Yesterday Obama campaigned with JayZ & Springsteen while Hurricane Sandy victims across NY & NJ are still decimated by Sandy  Wrong 
Make sure to verify the voting machine does not switch your vote  If you have any problems  notify the poll workers  
More reports of voting machines switching Romney votes to Obama  Pay close attention to the machines  don't let your vote be stolen

In the 1950’s our climate was far more unstable than it has been over the last 5 years  
The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U S  manufacturing non competitive  


@NGen52 I never went bankrupt  
@jtylerdowling Thanks 
@SpencerLJackson Yes 
Remember: Obama turned down $5M to charity which I said I would increase by 10X to $50M just to show simple records  He's hiding lots 
If you voted for Obama in 2008 to prove you were not a racist then vote for Romney in 2012 to prove you are not stupid  Thanks Walter D 

Despite the upcoming election  the cover of paper thin Time Magazine looks like an ad for the movie Lincoln sad 
Before you vote  think: Obama wants to raise taxes  @MittRomney wants to lower taxes need I say more 
Why is Obama playing basketball today  That is why our country is in trouble 
I was invited to be with Mitt Romney tonight win  lose  or draw  I’ll be there 
Answer to your questions I will be voting at 10:30 AM at Lighthouse International 110 East 60th Street  Manhattan 
Go out and vote this will be the most important election of our time 

Benghazi is bigger than Watergate  Don’t let Obama get away with allowing Americans to die  Kick him out of office tomorrow  
The outer boroughs of Manhattan are still devasted by Sandy  How would the press cover this if a Republican was President  
China is worried  The polls are trending for @MittRomney  They won’t be able to steal from us anymore  
 @ABFAlecBaldwin P S  Your brother @StephenBaldwin7 is doing very well on @ApprenticeNBC and he stated he adores you  
 @ABFAlecBaldwin They were rising in the 1950's then went back down they will go up and down through eternity  
Voting for @GovGaryJohnson is voting for Obama don't waste your vote 
Tomorrow’s election will have historic repercussions for our country  Make America strong again  Vote for @MittRomney  
@mcuban Do you mean the President's birthplace  
 @mcuban Letterman @Late_Show had his best ratings with me and you bombed  People don't care about Mark Cuban  
After 13 seasons  @ApprenticeNBC easily beat Shark Tank in ratings last year better demos as well  
 @mcuban  Shark Tank was shoved to Friday evening Friday is considered “dead television ” Besides  you are not the star (& never will be)  
Obama just stated It's always good to ignore Donald Trump  I state he is right  especially when the truth is against him  
 @mcuban Baseball commissioner and owners were smart when they didn’t want you to buy a team but I don’t think you have the money anyway

Don't believe Chrysler (if Obama wins) see how fast @Jeep production will be moved to China and I'll be watching 

Only 1 mill  dollars @mcuban  Offer me real money and I’d consider it  Your team and networks lose so much money I doubt you have much left 

Dummy @mcuban is at it again trying to use me to get publicity for himself 
In ’08  America voted for Hope & Change  Instead  we got incompetency  Now it is time to put a real job creator in office  Vote 4 Mitt

We can't destroy the competitiveness of our factories in order to prepare for nonexistent global warming  China is thrilled with us 

It’s extremely cold in NY & NJ—not good for flood victims  Where is global warming  

Thank you to @piersmorgan for your nice statement about me in the @HollywoodReporterhttp://bit ly/SvM0vt

@Lorrainejuliet @EDLTrobinson @FloridaJayhawk @hannityshow Must be careful & smart 
@ewim55 Then he wouldn't be president  
@TrickettTweeter No  his facts are very bad for him  
@eheinlen Yes  
 @ralphreed is doing a great job 
This is a time for big ideas  This is a time for real reform for a real recovery  @PaulRyanVP 
Remember when you vote  Obamacare is a disaster 
@conedison  call GM Dan Scavino at 914 944 0900  
Like @conedison  Obama is incompetent 
@conedison is incompetent and will have tremendous liability to Briarcliff Manor and Trump National 
@conedison doesn't even respond to the people in Briarcliff   like a forgotten area  
@conedison is terrible   don't know what they are doing  Trump National Briarcliff and all houses are totally blacked out 
@MittRomney will turn this mess around 
Make sure you get out and vote   most important election of our generation   go Romney 
Trump Hotels are delivering lots of food to storm victims   we love doing it 
Gary Johnson is asking people to waste their vote on him  Make it count vote for @MittRomney  
We don’t want to have a recount in any of the battleground states  Obama will steal it  Make sure all your friends and family vote  
Obama's war on women has lead to the biggest decline in female employment in 40 years  4 more years   
Undecideds in OH PA and WI will make the difference  All should ask themselves if they want $6/gallon gas because it will come under Obama  
Pennsylvania is in play @MittRomney  All undecideds in Philly suburbs should ask themselves who do you trust most on @Israel  
I think @TheRevAl should take this challenge  Axelrod was too scared  RT: @RonKaufmanIntrn: Kaufstache vs  Sharpstache  

Considering Obama hasn’t proposed anything concrete  if he wins he won’t have a mandate  Another 4 years of legislative stalemate  


Castro  Chavez and Ahmadinejad are all anxiously awaiting our election results  They are praying Obama wins  
Obama promised 5 2% unemployment by October 2012  His promises are worthless 
Go as far as you can see; when you get there  you'll be able to see farther  J P  Morgan 
Make sure to catch @history’s season finale of “The Men Who Built America” on Sun  November 11th  Great show  

Could be the hurricane helps @MittRomney people are rioting in the streets over gasoline 

Global warming is based on faulty science and manipulated data which is proven by the emails that were leakedhttp://onforb es/rDpyGO  
Obama has destroyed the middle class  In ’09  median household income was $55 198  Now it is $50 678  Four more years  
I have an idea for A Rod buy a home at @TrumpGolfLA overlooking the Pacific will bring you better luck  
A Rod is now looking for an expensive home in Beverly Hills why aren't the @Yankees terminating his contract for misrepresentation  
 @eagles should sit Michael Vick  He is a great athlete but less than average quarterback  

We don't need a Secretary of Business to understand business  we need a president who understands business and I do @MittRomney 
Unemployment is now 7 9%  Four years and $6 5T later  that is really bad 
@simonsam It is Trump water thanks  
How about President Obama fixing the gasoline situation instead of taking photo ops in the destruction  
 @maggiepolitico is an unprofessional hack who belongs @politico with all the other Obama hacks  

Interestingly  the hurricane may now be a disaster for Obama's reelection because of his grandstanding  
People are struggling to get gasoline for their cars we are like a third world country  
I'm sending lots of bottled water out to Staten Island & Long Island  
 @TheRevAl came to my Trump Tower office to apologize for calling me a racist very nice  apology accepted 
 @BarbaraJWalters called my office to ask me to do election night coverage with her sadly  I won't be able to do it  
 @RalphGilles of Chrysler should focus on design rather than filthy language not very professional  
We should not allow @Chrysler to move @Jeep jobs to China after they said they wouldn't stay tuned 
 @Chrysler disputes my statement but watch Chrysler move @Jeep jobs to China after the election  
With long gas lines & total disarray from storm  the hurricane may yet be a negative for Obama  
It was announced this morning that unemployment rose this can't be good for Obama  
Next year I will be changing the name of 800 acre Doral to Trump National Doral  It will be the best resort in the country—Miami is hot 
I will start reviewing various political reporters etc & websites as to their professionalism & fairness—many people asking for this  
How could Obama leave those American heroes out to die in Benghazi  And he continues to lie to the public 
What is your thought as to why Obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications  
Nice to see Obama released a situation room photo from Sandy  How about releasing the photo taken during Benghazi  
Everybody knows why Obama would not show his college applications they are just not willing to say 
If I would have offered Obama a billion dollars to show his records  he would have refused  
My video response to President Obama's lack of transparency http://youtu be/tYgW3_w3TS8 hd=1 … 

I will soon be releasing my response to the fact that President Obama refused to show his applications and records to the public  
President Obama missed the deadline 
Obama is a terrible negotiator  He bails out Chrysler and now Chrysler wants to send all Jeep manufacturing to China and will 
Why is Obama’s auto bailout now creating jobs in China  He is ruining American industry  
To all @MittRomney supporters  make sure you have taken advantage of early voting now so you can GOTV on election day  

You know the world is crazy when New York gets hit by a hurricane and Florida doesn't  
Let's continue to destroy the competitiveness of our factories & manufacturing so we can fight mythical global warming  China is so happy 
Do you believe @algore is blaming global warming for the hurricane  
From 1954 to 1960 there were 10 major hurricanes that hit the East Coast  
It's 10 AM: Two hours to go for Obama to easily pick up millions for charity 
The successful man will profit from his mistakes and try again in a different way  Dale Carnegie 
@stass13 Thanks 
Obama is now standing in a puddle acting like a President give me a break  
A lot of people are concerned about which charity my $5M will be donated to  The onus is on Obama to first release his records  
President Obama  if it is important to you  I will substantially increase the $5M offer 
President Obama  please take the $5M check for charity tomorrow  It is so easy and could do so much good 

Congratulations to @MittRomney on getting the @DMRegister  @NewYorkPost  @NewYorkObserver & @NashuaTelegraph endorsements 
Spoiler @dennisrodman has really got his act together so far on the upcoming season of @CelebApprentice    

How does a dummy like @billmaher get a television show & his ratings stink  You'd think @HBO could do a lot better  
A lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with Obama’s lack of transparency  I don't blame them  
There is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the $5M to a charity of Obama’s choice  once he releases all of his records  

 @Disney's acquisition of Lucas Film is a smart deal for both sides  Disney just bought a great brand which will keep producing revenue  
In the spirit of transparency  Obama should immediately release the 9 11 tape of Tyrone Woods pleading for military support in Benghazi  
Today Barack Obama is standing in water in NJ  Remember on election day that he has put the US underwater  
How many illegal foreign donations will Obama collect this final week  Another scandal ignored by the liberal media http://bit ly/RPmehP

 @oreillyfactor called me a master marketeer last night I am not  I am a great builder I build great things & people come  


Kevin Garnett's response to Ray Allen last night was that of a great competitor nothing wrong in fact it was terrific  A champion 
I was standing with @SHAQ when a young high school star  Kevin Garnett @Celtics  said to a crowd Forget Shaq  I want to meet Donald Trump  

I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go  
The President has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5M for his favorite charity  Looking like he won't be doing it  What is he hiding  

The polls & momentum are trending towards @MittRomney  Don't let the hurricane change your thinking 
Fans shouldn't worry  We have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of @CelebApprentice appropriately due to the storm  

Maybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm  
Scary  Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years  4 more years  

Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition  Hiding something  
@digiphile @RedCross RT if you think Pres Obama should release his records to get $5M for charity for Red Cross or another great charity 
Glad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12 5  Taylor is terrific 
Let’s be honest  if Obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm  then he would have been in Ohio on Monday  
How did Obama go to a Las Vegas fundraiser on 9 12  the day after he refused to send help to Americans in Benghazi  
Without focus  it's just impossible to be successful at anything  Midas Touch 
I never fall for scams  I am the only person who immediately walked out of my ‘Ali G’ interview 
Another great cause Obama could send my $5M donation to is a charity for 9/11 First Responders  They are American heroes  
My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing the 57th St  crane  damage from the storm and extending my $5M offer to Obamahttp://bit ly/UdxTrb  

These last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% GDP  Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history  
The election is trending towards @MittRomney  Americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline  

The Trump Tower atrium is such a great place & kept thousands of people warm & safe during the storm thanks  staff 
 @MatthewLumby Charity should get the money 
@neilmsdunn Dopey  few have built more than me  
Remember this: Obama wants to raise taxes  @MittRomney wants to lower taxes need I say more 
Don't let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states  

I am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap  I would have been lambasted from coast to coast  
Because of the hurricane  I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama's favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday  
Not only giving out money  but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President don't fall for it  
Hurricane is good luck for Obama again he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars  
I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm  
The water damage to NYC is amazing  The winds were bad but the water was worse  
All weights are on crane's wrong side very precarious below  move out 
If authorities need direct view from top of Trump Tower  call office  

We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atrium they are seeking refuge  Free coffee and food  
So far the hurricane is being handled very well in NY  not nearly as bad as stated on news  Let's see what happens later  
Many people walked out on Madonna's concert when she told them to vote for Obama  Years ago I walked out because the concert was terrible 

Obama lied 100% about Libya and the killings emails are absolute  He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies  
Dave Letterman @Late_Show said during my interview that Obama was probably born in the US the word probably is a disaster for Obama  
I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go  


I guess @BillMaher saw my ratings on the @Late_Show the other night where Letterman beat Leno  Bill  you are no Letterman  
While @BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman  I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct  
 @BetteMidler talks about my hair but I'm not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body so I won't  Is this a double standard  
But whenever she sees me  she kisses my ass  She's disgusting  @BetteMidler 
I never liked @BetteMidler's persona or singing and haven't heard her name in years  
Now grotesque @BetteMidler is into the Trump act trying to become relevant again  
Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers I agree  
A lot changed when David Letterman said he was probably born in this country the word probably is a total disaster for Obama  

I defended @StarJonesEsq when she lied about her stomach operation to lose weight only to get blindsided by her on the @todayshow  

I am going to the @nyjets game with @woodyjohnson4  the owner of the team  a great guy  
@johnsununu is taking major heat for calling the president lazy  But the president stated his weakness is that he is lazy  Fight on John 
@BernardMcGuirk  That's more than O'Reilly did    and he is supposed to be my friend  You're terrific 
@Bernard McGuirk Thanks for being so nice and defending me on O'Reilly   you're terrific 
Alert   The president knew that the ambassador was being attacked in Benghazi  He did nothing   he is no leader  
@DonnyDeutsch tries so hard to be a star  But  he just doesn't have what it takes   and he never will  
I put @DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request  I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement  
I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President  
The TODAY Show should call me about who to put on the show— I know more about people who get ratings than anyone  

I hear they are very unhappy w/ Arianna and @huffingtonpost at @AOL  I’ll bet she won’t be there for long 


If Obama doesn't accept my offer to be fully transparent  what will he say  
If my offer is refused  every undecided OH voter will be fully aware that Obama denied $5M to charity all because he is hiding something 
Barack Obama has everything to gain  Why would anyone ever deny $5M to charity  



I have decided to add a caveat to my offer  Obama can't decide to send my $5M to Rev  Wright if he releases his records  
My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohio make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day  Know you can Must win Ohio  
Where's the transparency  Despite Obama's denial @sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with Jeremiah Wright  

Pretty audacious for Obama to call @MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write  
By the way  where is @Oprah  Good question  4 years ago she strongly supported Obama now she is silent  Anyway  who cares  I adore Oprah  
   Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction  
Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester  The Middle East is a mess  Yet Colin Powell still endorses him  Wonder why  
Be careful of an Obama bomb to win election Would be a horrible thing to do  
The election is still close but trending toward @MittRomney  He leads all national polls and Obama's likeability is imploding  VOTE 
Wow Letterman show @Late_Show won the ratings last night big time and guess who was his guest  DJT 



@crushthespirit True 
What a dumb mistake AOL made buying the @huffingtonpost  How much longer will Arianna last I predict not much

@MaureenPeronne @Late_Show Thanks  it was a great show   
@MRJMF1 @Late_Show Thanks I will  
Stupid Arianna @huffingtonpost hired the man who ruined the once great NYTimes Business Section    
   a real loser named Tim O'Brien and it's never recovered  
Dopey Arianna @huffingtonpost is really after me boring story after boring story   but I hear she is in big trouble 
I knew last year that @TIME Magazine lost all credibility when they didn't include me in their Top 100    
    I will soon start naming magazines that I think will fold I predicted Newsweek  
@yewkalaylee Great idea  
@seketa77 I hope so for the charity's sake 
@TylarReese Thanks Tylar 

@LianneOnLife I love the Wounded Warriors Obama should choose that as his $5M charity  
@RyanSeven Sounds like a good idea  
@Erizzle05 Only because he has something to hide  
 @SabrinaSiddiqui Re: Taylor and Conor great news for Taylor 
Based on the ovation last night from the Letterman @Late_Show audience  I believe it will be hard for Obama to throw $5M down the drain     
    instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause  
Another great charity that the $5M could go to just a recommendation to the Pres  the Wounded Warriors represented so well by @TraceAdkins 
Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi  
Letterman @Late_Show was great last night  I had a lot of fun  You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the $ for charity  
The dealmaker is cunning  secretive  focused and never settles for less than he wants  The America We Deserve 
It is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop $5M from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent  
Doing David Letterman @Late_Show tonight at 11:30  1st nite of Sweeps Going into the lion's den but I've been there many times before  Enjoy 
Six days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires    
For someone who demanded 20 years of Mitt's tax returns  you would think my offer to donate $5M to charity for his records is an easy go  


I hope Derek Jeter’s recovery is going well  He is a very special player and a great guy  New York loves him  @yankees 

@politico has really become a laughing stock of good political reporting  
What will be the response on Wednesday  If Obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity  
@michellemalkin I fully supported McCain but when he lost  hoped Obama would be great for U S  he wasn't  
 @Mark_Sanchez shouldn’t be too upset over @EvaLongoria  He will always do great 
I am offering the chance for Barack Obama to redistribute $5M to any charity of his choice  Everyone wins  Take the deal

My @gretawire interview discussing my $5M charitable offer to Obama  his lack of transparency & my tremendous supporthttp://bit ly/TbJ2aR  



Just stated by a total pro: You are the only one who has the guts to say what we are all thinking  
Glad to hear North Carolina is solid for @MittRomney  It started trending for Mitt solidly after my speech at the @NCGOP convention  
In light the Benghazi emails released last night  it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public    
    By releasing his records  he can come clean with the American people and have $5 million go to a charity  
Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets  Why can't he release his records  Especially when $5M is going to charity  
I am happy to donate $5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses  All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American people 

I just learned that @politico has no credibility total phonies that don't report the truth  A puppet of Obama  
Glad to hear @seanhannity supports my offer to Obama  As Sean says “it is an easy $5 million to charity  What does Obama have to lose ” 
Third rate @politico took every negative tweet or response they could find & put it out when in fact the response is incredibly positive  
My offer to Obama is about transparency  In 2008  American people were sold on hope and change  This our last chance to get the full record  
RT @ReutersPolitics: Trump to give $5 million to charity if Obama releases recordshttp://reut rs/P2JjAw  

The response has been fantastic actually overwhelming Thank you 

You have all been waiting the response has been amazing Watch my announcement now  press release to follow at 12:15 http://bitly com/SivjCv  
All predictions re: my 12 o'clock release are totally incorrect  Stay tuned 
Story will be released today at 12 noon EST on Twitter and Facebook  
Invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the attack  Sun Tzu 


If you like having the world collapse and being told America is leading from behind vote Obama  
No wonder @BBC is in such big trouble & boss was just fired they are lost  
 @BBC should never have played that piece of garbage documentary & yet the phones are ringing off the hook to play the course  
   that it was hard not to end up rooting for Trump    
Thank you to @DailyTelegraph reviewer @NeilMidgley who stated 'You've Been Trumped' was so biased in favour of the protesters    
 @bobschieffer did an excellent job as debate moderator last night  I only wish Mitt was more aggressive 
Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert & Kristen I don't have time except to say Robert  drop her  she cheated on you & will again 
Last night was the first time Obama said we instead of I in respect to Bin Laden's killing  
Barack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden now he wants all of the credit 
My announcement is tomorrow 
Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject 
China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own 
Mitt Romney must start congratulating the Navy Seals and military on Bin Laden’s killing  not the President  
 @MittRomney should have been more aggressive last night  Yet some polls have him winning the debate  
My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing last night’s presidential debate  my stock picks and tomorrow’s big announcementhttp://bit ly/UwPbom  

When the military informed Obama that they had Bin Laden  is there anyone with a brain that would not have said Ok  go get him   

Lance Armstrong fought for 7 years & then just ran out of energy  Very sad story although they caught him red handed He definitely cheated 
Casting sometimes is fate and destiny more than skill and talent  from a director's point of view  Steven Spielberg 
No matter what happens in the election  @davidaxelrod deserves a lot of credit  He has kept Obama in it  even with his terrible record  
I always said that @lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges  By stopping  he gave his enemies an opening  

The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy and I mean much more  
Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night  Viewership will be way down  
I will be doing @SquawkCNBC at 7:30  

 @MittRomney looks much calmer  and Obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward  
Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight  Always treated me fairly  
Well this is it  the final debate let's see how it goes  I'll be tweeting live  
I have watched @Linda_McMahon for years she will bring jobs & business back to Connecticut incredible woman 
My good friends in Connecticut have a great opportunity to send an amazing businesswoman to Washington  Vote for @Linda_McMahon for Senate 

@BRANDONTHRILL Thanks a great compliment  
@trottofficial Thanks and doing great business from all over the world  
Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden  They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit  All he did is say O K  

I look forward to @MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi  CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs  
Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama just wait and see 
 @bobschieffer will a great job tonight he is a real pro and respected by both sides  

Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart  In a couple of years  he will thank me  Be smart  Robert  
Obama is an easy target on foreign policy @MittRomney has many openings to attack  especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden  
This is my last election  After my election I have more flexibility  Obama to @MedvedevRussiaE discussing our nuclear arsenal  

Obama planted that @nytimes story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate  He wants Libya and China off the table  

@LarryLivermore @tufnrs73 Dopey  I never went bankrupt  
@DukePGA Ken Thanks I am proud of you  Great job on tour this year I always knew  
@Patti0713 Thanks 
@Yea4Country @politico Thanks it needs a lot of work  
@AustinMay Austin thanks 

   now @AlexSalmond doesn't like me who cares 

The @BBC is widely criticized for a lack of professionalism  We dealt with a Roger Mosey a total lightweight who doesn't have a clue  
 @Toure I felt very sorry for you during your meltdown on @PiersMorgan  He drove you insane but  of course  Piers is a lot smarter than you 
The @BBC is in total disarray  I know personally how bad they are pathetic http://nyti ms/RdyUSx  
My son Don and his wife Vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named Spencer Frederick very thrilling  
@kennedy_mac Dopey  I never went bankrupt 

Last week I had @SInow's tweet of the week and the most retweeted @MittRomney mention twice   Can anyone else top that  Don't think so 
Had a great time watching the @nyjets @Patriots game yesterday at Gillette Stadium  Great and exciting game  

I wish tonight's debate would cover more than foreign policy  

Don't let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected be careful Republicans 
 @Toure  when you are fired from MSNBC for your bad ratings and racist coverage  stop by and say hello  
Autism rates through the roof why doesn't the Obama administration do something about doctor inflicted autism  We lose nothing to try  
We should march on Washington re:autism with leadership & common sense the numbers would drop precipitously 
Lots of autism and vaccine response  Stop these massive doses immediately  Go back to single  spread out shots What do we have to lose  

New Hampshire is a critical state for both candidates this year  I got to know New Hampshire and love it  


My @foxandfriends interview discussing Lance Armstrong losing his titles  Obama's foreign policy & my BIG announcementhttp://bit ly/QN26Mw  
Stay tuned for my big Obama announcement probably on Wednesday   
People are going crazy with my comments on Diet Coke (soda)  Let's face it this stuff just doesn't work  It makes you hungry  
The anti wind turbine movement in Scotland against @AlexSalmond is amazing keep going Scots  save your country 
Obama should stop talking about wind turbines they are a disaster for a country or community & are very expensive & unreliable  
I will be live tweeting during the debate tonight  
Derek  get well soon  the @Yankees need youl  
Gas prices are at crazy levels fire Obama 
Sleepy Eyes @chucktodd owes @jack_welch an apology  Jack is right on unemployment the new jobless claims make 7 8% an impossibility  
They succeed  because they think they can  Virgil 
Don Butler and executives are doing a great job at @Cadillac the cars are fantastic  
The biggest problem with A Rod is he is bad for the chemistry of the Yankees he must go  
Fort Hood shooting should be declared a terror attack  Respect the wounded and dead  
Good luck to Derek on his operation  I know it will be a success he is a great champion  
Derek must move back into one of my buildings immediately  It will be lucky for him like in past  
Derek Jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in Trump World Tower  
7 8% unemployment number is a complete fraud as evidenced by the jobless claims number released yesterday Real unemployment is at least 15% 
 @MittRomney's @RNC convention came in over $3M under budget  Barack’s @DNC convention is over $10M in debt  What a surprise 

Can't wait for @VanityFair to fold which  under Graydon Carter  will be sooner rather than later  
 @VanityFair's terrible piece on Mitt's faith is a new low  even for them  
Where were all the @VanityFair exposes on When Rev  Wright disciples go to Washington  Sad 

Rev  @BillyGraham is a great man and so is his son  Franklin Graham  
Rev @BillyGraham is doing tremendous work this election cycle educating the Christian community on @MittRomney  
Both Barack and @MittRomney were excellent at the Al Smith dinner last night 
A lot of the @Yankees should be ashamed of their play in the post season  They are lucky they don't have to deal with George Steinbrenner  
I hope @boyscouts of America handle their problems a lot better than the board at Penn State did  You can't do any worse 
@rginn_1 Toledo is a great place I've been there & worked in Cincinnati for 2 years I love Ohio  
@RickyTheBitch @ladygaga I think Gaga is great her 1st major appearance at my Miss Universe Pageant in Vietnam/6 yrs ago Should give me 25% 
Newly released NH poll has @MittRomney with a 1 point lead  Mitt will pull away next week  
Obama has called Libya attack a bump in the road and not optimal  Just come clean already tell Americans the truth 
Maybe Derek Jeter should ask A Rod about renting his apartment next year  Very soon A Rod won't need a place in NYC  
Yes I will be live tweeting during the final debate this coming Monday  
Via @CraveOnline: Donald Trump is NOT A Rod fanhttp://bit ly/WJNSS2

 @katyperry is no bargain but I don't like John Mayer he dates and tells be careful Katy (just watch )  

So many tweets & stories on Stewart/Pattinson Look  it doesn't matter the relationship will never be the same  It is permanently broken  
@D_Hastie @lancearmstrong No  I said U S  destroyed a once American icon 


 @lancearmstrong really blew it went down in flames too bad 

Why would Ohio listen to Bruce Springsteen reading his lines  Be careful or I will go to Ohio and @MittRomney will win it 
@JakfromBk Thanks 
@MisterJoe49 @Yankees I agree  but their careers weren't fueled by drugs  
Obama said not optimal to Ambassador & embassy killings bad word usage for a Harvard graduate  

@evaemery Never give up  You have what it takes  
Great decision by Donald Graham @Newsweek to sell  I'll now have to take my newsweek covers off the wall  
With Barry Diller & Tina Brown in charge  did anyone doubt that @Newsweek would be a massive failure  

Something really bad happened to the @Yankees psyche much like our President 
 @Yankees should get rid of A Rod ASAP I can't watch this guy anymore 
 @evaemery Thanks you sound great 
@Rosie @realDonaldTrump Thanks for the info Rosie get well  
I'll be making a major announcement on President Obama next week stay tuned 
Can't believe we are less than three weeks away from the election  Time certainly flies 
A penny saved is a penny earned  Benjamin Franklin 
The Yankees are absolutely terrible what happened to this team  
@gastronome2 I love India 
Hey @Rosie how is your recovery going  I hope you are doing well so we can start fighting again soon 
@waycooljr37 @Nationals Bob Kraft & Coach Bill are far too smart 
@YouthPastorDarr @seanhannity @megynkelly @JohnCena Good luck 
@toddulu @Nationals I hope that's the reason otherwise  just plain stupid  
@donmarie16 A total professional  
@CalumSpence Greatly appreciated  thanks  
@Morali_Arch Great to meet you also  
@NeanderthalMan1 @MittRomney I was referring  of course  to Bill Clinton's statement on the economy  
@crazymom28 I have a friend that wants to meet your sister  

The last time I visited China I couldn't believe all the construction  You can go up with a project in a week no red tape  
It's Thursday  How much money did Barack Obama waste today on crony green energy projects  
Clinton commented in Ohio today that @MittRomney is right  the economy has not been fixed under Obama I always said Bill was an honest man  
When Strasburg leaves @Nationals for another team for more money  will Washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good  
Bad sign for Obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states  Their internals must be horrendous  
While the next season of @CelebApprentice is packed w/ All Stars  ours fans will be happy to see @Joan_Rivers in the board room She is back 
Derek Jeter @yankees wants to rent an apartment  Derek only in a Trump building Trump is lucky for you  
Now there is talk of A Rod being shipped to @Marlins  If A Rod is not a @yankee next year  the fans will be happy  
I think the @yankees will win today  Unlike A Rod  CC is good under pressure  I hope A Rod plays  however  
@NickJ102 @antbaxter I don't want to fall asleep in public  
Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen but I'm right  If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider  

@darbizman Thanks 
@G_Harwood Because they are either jealous or losers (or both)  

Newsweek ending print edition sad  Now my Newsweek covers mean nothing they lost all credibility  TIME to follow  
@PartyCoveMag @espn @politico @WSJ Thanks 
@loveandgarbage Dopey who went bankrupt  you  I never did  
The biggest thrill in the world is entertaining the public  there is no bigger thrill than that  Vince McMahon @WWE 
@womenzbinder Check the records  dummy I was never a Bush II fan he is why we have Obama 
@antbaxter @MailOnline They only suffered by watching your 3rd rate documentary (which bombed)  
@jeff_coles I will thanks  
Lots of response to my Pattinson/Kristen Stewart reunion  She will cheat again 100 certain am I ever wrong  
Looking forward to honoring the great Dogan family & the success of the Trump Towers project in Istanbul @FollowTurkey Annual Gala Dinner 
Alert US jobless claims up 46 000 to 388 000  Really bad news  7 8% is now a fraud not possible 
Amazing my tweets are covered across every spectrum from @espn to @politico to @WSJ  
When we're talking about math that doesn't add up  how about $5 trillion of deficits over the last four years  @MittRomney 
Obama's spending and borrowing is burying America and destroying our children's future  Does he even care  


 @ashleycam2883 Re: Libya Hillary took the blame for Obama  
Mitt's proposed tax cuts for the middle class will spur record economic growth  


If Obama goes after Mitt's private sector experience in the next debate then Mitt should ask for Obama's college records all of them  
 @mystikangel Bring @johnrich back  He is back 


What is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all  We should be given credit for taking this risk  
Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight  
Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart  She cheated on him like a dog & will do it again just watch  He can do much better 
Michael Vick of the Philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback  
Initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped  See what happens when I am not mentioned  
Just read about my friend @HulkHogan he was set up too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles  
@BillRancic Bill You should have named your beautiful son Donald  
Joe Girardi @Yankees must play his starters  even A Rod  they got you there  
While the @Yankees look like they quit and are finished  they won't quit for CC 

CC is a great pitcher and can handle pressure @Yankees will win tonight  So far my predictions have all been correct  
George Steinbrenner @yankees would have gotten out of A Rod's contract three years ago   but put A Rod in tonight  
Obama talks about what he is going to do why the hell didn't he just do it  especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary 
Obama at big debate disadvantage he just can't get away from his bad record  
 @MittRomney scored last night on both substance and style  

   Bad decisions can be devastating  
Obama was beaten but not knocked out  He lives to fight another day  But in the real world presidents are not given a second chance    
All the guys that said @MittRomney would lose are rapidly coming on board  Mitt will remember the early helpers  
If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically  environmentally & aesthetically  
Robert Bryce @NYPost Congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines & how destructive they are  Windmills are a disaster  
Remember  new environment friendly lightbulbs can cause cancer  Be careful the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care  
Wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds  they are killing the finances & environment of many countries & communities  
Great article on wind turbines by Robert Bryce in today's @NYPosthttp://bit ly/V5AwvJ  
Really enjoyed discussing @yankees yesterday with @RealMicihaelKay  I am a long time Yankee fan  

@marileenelson Thanks 

My twitter followers will soon be over 2 million & all the biggies  It's like having your own newspaper  
My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth  
Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama  Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win  Don't put it past him 
Obama did much better than he did last time but still lost decisively  
Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night  I don't 
Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal  If we do not win energy as a country  we just do not win  period 
I still love Derek  he is a winner 
Remember  I said Derek don't sell your Trump World Tower apartment   its been lucky for you  The day after he sold it  he broke his foot  
At the debate  the President kept talking of what he is going to do  I kept saying  why didn't he do it  He lost me a long time ago  
Verlander pitched great  but @Yankees look truly defeated  
Stupid George Will gave @MittRomney no chance 3 months ago  Take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy  
George Will said best debate he ever saw   If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting  
Debate showed these guys really hate each other  At one point it looked like they would come to blows   

You talk tough  Mr  President  but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy  
Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama  No wonder nothing gets done  
 @MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems  Obama has no answer  
Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton he is no Bill Clinton  
Obama weak on immigration  All words  no action  He's been Prez 4 years  
Obama is looking rhetorical and weak  @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp  
Obama just said @MittRomney was a very successful investor big mistake for Obama to admit he has less and less credibility  
Obama keeps saying that he will do something but why hasn't he done it  It's all talk  
 @MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential 
Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices  
Good response on jobs by @MittRomney  
Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs  
Why hasn't Obama created jobs  
Getting ready to watch the debate as they say let's get ready to rumble 
I was just told by one of the top @PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country  Very nice compliment I agree  
We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age They just don't believe we would  
@drumline_mormon It is selling great at Macy's thanks 
For political purposes only  Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election  
Great win last night by Peyton Manning & @Denver_Broncos in San Diego coming from 24 points behind on the road  Very impressive  
If the @yankees can somehow beat Verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series  And I will go to games 6& 7 so they will win 
Get ready for tonight 
@MissUSA Olivia we love you  You are doing a great job  
 @MittRomney if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records & transcripts he will quiet down quickly  
Good luck @MittRomney tonight have no doubt you will be great  
Congratulations to @JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud  @DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice  
I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in Benghazi  

Between Libya  the national security leaks and Fast & Furious  Obama has had more national security scandals than any other President  
 @reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party hope he gets the credit he deserves  
 @antbaxter I tried watching but fell asleep  
 @History's wonderful The Men Who Built America with me on tonight at 9 bad timing  I'll be live tweeting the debate 
Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate  tonight's audience will be humongous people want to see if he is for real  
The Coca Cola company is not happy with me that's okay  I'll still keep drinking that garbage  
It's amazing my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @CNBC draw the highest ratings  And they get bigger week by week thanks folks 
Had a great time with @PaulRyanVP last night on the Intrepid  Paul is terrific  
Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row  At least he is consistent  
All the morons that cause the controversy in Scotland have made my development far more successful than anticipated  

Diet Coke tweet had a monster response dammit  I wish the stuff worked  
 @antbaxter Thanks for helping promote & make Trump International Golf Links Scotland so successful you stupid fool 
 @antbaxter Your documentary died many deaths  You have  in my opinion  zero talent  
I can confirm the reports @BillRancic  my first season winner  will be returning to this All Star season of @CelebApprentice  
 @rupertmurdoch is absolutely right  it will be a nightmare for @Israel if Obama is re elected  
Verlander is great but very beatable  Does not have a good ERA in playoff games 
I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers  
I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight  We'll all be watching @MittRomney  
Lots of pressure on Obama tonight even more than A Rod  If he doesn't perform well it could be over  
I hope A Rod has a great night for the Yankees he owes it to them especially with Derek hurt  
@jbluvx2 Happy Birthday 
Gov  Gary Johnson pulling votes from @MittRomney Don't waste your vote  Obama must go 

Based on very popular demand  I will be live tweeting tomorrow night during the Presidential debate  
The invisible hand of the market always moves faster and better than the heavy hand of government  @MittRomney 
Sometimes the best thing you can do is just let things ride  let time go by  Donald J  Trump 
The more Diet Coke  Diet Pepsi  etc you drink  the more weight you gain  

If @MittRomney has a good debate tomorrow night  Obama is finished 


Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator  He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us  
Looking forward to honoring the great Dogan family and the success of the Trump Towers project in Istanbul @FollowTurkey Annual Gala Dinner 
A Rod should donate his contract to charity  He doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform  He is a $30M/yr rip off  
Looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @MittRomney supporters at the Intrepid  Mitt's doing well  

The @brooklynnets logo is plain and boring but if they win it won't matter  
 @antbaxter's documentary on my Scottish golf club was so boring and wrong  He is a small timer with no talent  
My @foxandfriends interview discussing @JoeBiden's performance  the Libya cover up and tomorrow's crucial debatehttp://bit ly/QnyqHU  
Barack Obama is not who you think he is  Most overrated politician in US history  
Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications  Boy would that create a mess He is not who you think

I don't get @JerrySeinfeld's stumbling  bumbling humor no better than his failed Marriage Ref tv show 
Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke  let's face it  it doesn't work just makes you hungry  
Lots of response on Derek but I told him his apartment was lucky We love Derek  
In case you missed it  my @todayshow interview discussing announcing the All Star cast of @CelebApprenticehttp://on today com/QVMyd0  
 @ArsenioOFFICIAL Why not everyone else is using it it's available at @Macys  
@SchroedBoss @ErichFSchroeder and your parents meant the world to me 
A Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue even though he was on the juice 
@mcginness1 Thanks a great country 
Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower I told him not to sell karma  
 @SbelSbel3555 Sorry  @piersmorgan is a very smart guy 
 @ErichFSchroeder Your dad was a great man & great leader  
@LeighAnnMac Thank you 
I love @LibertyUniversity such great people 
A Rod is just not making it  We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great  
I feel guilty not having attended the last two @yankees games (losses)  They would have won 
Obama will be trying very hard at next debate he doesn't want to lose the Boeing  
Who says Obama will do better in the next debate has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks 
 @MittRomney's poll numbers are looking really good  One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout   
I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke  
No  I wasn't at the @Yankees game yesterday can't go today either  When I go  they win  

Yankees can win today  Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher  
A Rod hit ball hard first at bat  Time for him to step up and leave  
Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night  
 @Yankees are in trouble without Derek  Try A Rod at short get him some confidence  
A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter he is a great champion  
So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg they deserved to lose  
Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away  Scrape and paint before too late  
Tonight  despite everything  put A Rod in the lineup   
Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A Rod  Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore the real reason   
They found Jessica in Colorado body was mutilated death to the pervert killer  
Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series  
I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win  
Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve they would have won  
When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say what were we doing   
I told you  whenever I go to a @Yankees game the @Yankees win  
Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality  Warren G  Bennis 
When an employee leaves me and begs to come back I never let them  Loyalty is very important  
I look forward to Tuesday night's presidential debate I wonder if Obama will use my name again  
Very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate  
What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy  @PaulRyanVP 
Obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families  The price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected  
With our amazing All Star cast  @Joan_Rivers  @johnrich  @ArsenioOFFICIAL & @piersmorgan are also returning as boardroom advisors  
Great to hear that our loyal @CelebApprentice fans are happy with today's announcement of the new cast  This will be something special 
 @dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act  
I'm going to the @Yankees game tonight to root them on they always win when I am there  
My Scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world a great honor for me  

Doing the @todayshow with @MLauer was great I really like Matt  

There are many ways of going forward  but only one way of standing still  Pres  Franklin D  Roosevelt 
@dennisrodman @ApprenticeNBC Great to have you back for the best season yet 
ObamaCare is a complete disaster  Many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it  Terrible  
Wing bangers the name given to wind turbines by bird lovers for the thousands of birds they kill in the U S  
British PM Cameron is making a fool of himself by wasting billions of pounds on unwanted & environment destroying Scottish windmills  
Going over to @TodayShow now to introduce @ApprenticeNBC cast etc  watch  








Looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment  

Another sign that @jack_welch is right  New government labor report casts even more doubt on the September jobs datahttp://www aei ideas org/2012/10/new government report casts even more doubt on the september jobs data/ … 

It's Thursday and only 26 days until the election  How many illegal donations from China and Saudi Arabia did Obama collect today  

Our foreign policy decisions are dumbest in U S  history 
Live tweeting during tonight's VP debate   should be a great time 
How the hell does the Libyan government get off telling our embassy security they can't have loaded guns for protection  
Why the hell did we help the Libyan rebels in the first place  That is the real scandal  
Outright disgusting the Obama administration has continually stonewalled and lied to US Amb  Sean Smith's motherhttp://drudge tw/RxV7IN  
I suspect @JoeBiden could do well tonight  Don't be fooled by his gaffes  He is a seasoned and feisty debater  
If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish  A beater is always a beater just watch 
Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well  
$30M a year and A Rod is now relegated to the bench  @yankees would have lost if Girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction) 
I guess they have Lance Armstrong cold  Brutal report  A waste of taxpayer money to take down an American hero  
 @Apprenticenbc cast will be announced tomorrow at 7:30am ET on the @todayshow with @MLauer 
Staff at Trump Park Avenue disliked A Rod to put it mildly The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter  
Asking why my dislike of A Rod dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal 
Great move to take A Rod out of game  Now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation (drugs)  
Raul Ibanez did something never done in baseball history  Amazing move by manager Joe G  
After Obama's '07 racist speech on Katrina relief  he now won't provide any aid to victms of Hurricane Isaachttp://bit ly/SLog5O  
USA Today has the worst new newspaper logo in the business go back to the original 

When everything seems to be going against you  remember that the airplane takes off against the wind  not with it  Henry Ford 
@usa67us Thank you 


Congratulations to @FLGovScott on getting an A grade from @CatoInstitute on his fiscal policy  Rick is a fantastic governor  

I am more concerned about Biden in the debate than I am about Obama  Be careful on Thursday night 
You have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird  @MittRomney 

A Rod must be dropped in the Yankees line up tonight if they want to win  He simply can't perform without drugs  

Receiving thousands of thank you letters from @LibertyU students for my convocation speech  The honor was all mine Great people  

47M on food stamps  Over 23M Americans unemployed  50% of college grads unemployed  And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird  
Has Barack Obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations  Media  
I just had to fire someone  he didn't have a clue he reminded me of Obama on Wednesday night  
27 days until America's greatest test since our founding  In this election  we decide whether we become great again  
It doesn't matter who you vote for it matters who is counting the votes  Be careful of voter fraud 
Obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate  Let's see how he reacts under pressure  
Remember  Obama limped across the finish line he should have lost to Hillary  Be careful 
I don't think Obama will do well in the second debate he is psyched out just like A Rod

 @DavidLetterman @Late_Show fully apologized last night for calling me a racist  Thank you David we are again friends  
The public is about to learn a lot more information on Barack Obama and his true background in the coming weeks… 
Now that Obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran  He is desperate  
Mitt’s subsequent rise in the polls post debate shows that the American public can still spot a real winner  
“In order to build your wealth and improve your business smarts  you need to know about real estate ” Think Like a Billionaire 
With these record high gas prices  what does it say about Obama that he was trying to brag about his energy policy in the debate  
Looking forward to live tweeting during the rest of the debates  Will be a lot of fun  
When will the unemployment numbers be corrected  Sadly  after the election 

George Will is a political moron  Last month he said Romney couldn't win  
In the end  Andy Pettitte did not rat out his friend Roger Clemens  I like him again  a lot

Why isn't Obama protecting us from ridiculous gas prices  
California gas prices going thru the roof  others to follow  An election losing event for Obama

The majority of Americans agree with @MittRomney's comments on @Israel and Iran

The media is pathetic  Our embassies are savaged by radicals while Obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @MittRomney  
What a coincidence that Obama's good friends in Libya and Egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies  
With allies like Egypt and Libya  who needs enemies  
Shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11  
Obama told @NBC that Egypt is no longer an ally  They used to be until he pushed out Mubarak  
Filming of the record 13th season of @CelebApprentice has started  Be sure to be on the lookout for future updates  

If Obama was smart  he would cancel the Muslim Brotherhood's WH visit later this month  He won't  

With the high prices of corn to continue expect even more inflation on the price of food  
Obama's foreign policy is a complete and total disaster the worst President we have ever had  
We threw our ally Mubarak overboard and Egypt is now our enemy  Great going Obama Israel is in trouble  
This is all about American weakness and an incompetent President  

Weakness  cow towing and not standing firm is provocative  We are getting pushed around and robbed under this President  
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary  Vince Lombardi 
Our $16T national debt is now bigger than our $15T GDP  If Obama is re elected watch for an economic meltdown in 2013  
Deja vu I can remember a time when our embassies were stormed under another failed President  Obama=Carter  
I guess Obama's Cairo Speech really worked out  The Muslim Brotherhood stormed our embassy on 9 11  Imagine if Obama speaks in Beijing  
Those who refuse to draw red line to Iran don't have the moral right to put a red line to @Israel  @IsraeliPM @netanyahu 

Obama will go down as the worst President in history on many topics but especially foreign policy  


OPEC will use yesterday's attacks on our embassies to raise the price of gas  They are always ripping us off

As bad as they were  I don't remember our embassies being attacked when Mubarak and Gaddafi were in power  

Obama is a disaster at foreign policy  Never had the experience or knowledge  He is not capable of doing the job  
Libya is selling its oil to China I notice the Chinese Ambassador is very safe  
I always said the people we fought for in Libya were bad news  Once again  I was right  


We fight to free Libya and they kill our Ambassador and other Americans  Obama's foreign policy is a joke  
When will Obama next go on vacation if he wins the election  The day after  
I've read many books about China over the decades  I know the Chinese and made a lot of money with them  The Art of the Deal 
Why is the Pentagon wasting precious dollars on going 'green ' Complete waste  We need the best & easiest fuel for our military  
I hope the @GOP realizes that if they blow this election the Tea Party won't be with them next time  
There is no instance of a nation benefitting from prolonged warfare  Sun Tzu 
If Obama wins it is the end of the Republican party  @limbaugh 
Amazing  @CelebApprentice has started filming our record 13th season this week thanks to our big and very loyal fan base  
Priorities while fundraising and campaigning on our dime  Obama has skipped over 50% of his intel briefingshttp://wapo st/PiD36V  

Why won't Obama release his college applications  Is there something 'foreign' about them  
84% of US troops wounded & 70% of our brave men & women killed in Afghanistan have all come under Obama  Time to get out of there  
Whatever happened to Obama's 'independent investigation' into national security leaks from his administration  Where's the media  
The onus of the Chicago teachers' strike falls squarely on the teachers & their union  Inexcusable to leave children without school  
On this solemn day of remembrance we can all take joy in the fact that Bin Laden's last sight was a Navy SEAL pulling the trigger

An impromptu interview I did with German TV on 9/11 down by Ground Zero discussing the attack and WTC Towershttp://youtu be/aoYXihwcp8c  
Today we remember and honor our fellow Americans and NYPD and FDNY who fell 11 years ago

George Will is a pathetic columnist  His last article calling College Football 'progressive' is almost as dumb as his previous on the @NFL 
President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people Clint Eastwood 

Great win by the @nyjets yesterday  @Mark_Sanchez played a terrific opener to what should be a big time season  


The jobs report is a disaster  Can only get worse with other countries eating our lunch

One of the best moves I ever made was staying out of last decade's artificial real estate boom  But I used the downturn to my advantage  

A lot of people strongly advised me against doing @ApprenticeNBC  Next week we start filming the record 13th season Hence  go with your gut 
If @BarackObama had to use the same labor participation he had when he entered office then the unemployment number would be 11 2% 

Unemployment rate only dropped because more people are out of labor force & have stopped looking for work Not a real recovery  phony numbers 
There are now 119 000 fewer Americans employed than there were in July  The economy is still terrible  
Today's job report is dismal  Now a record 88 921 000 Americans are no longer in the work force  
Drew Peterson  a real sleaze  just convicted of killing wife  Change the law so he gets death penalty  
Dems had a very good and professional convention  The Republicans must be smart and tough and fast 
The Republicans must get Virgil Goode out of the race in Virginia  He will take votes away from @MittRomney  

Under @BarackObama  1 out of every 7 Americans is on food stamps  
Scary while @BarackObama has been POTUS for 1 6% of America's history  he has amassed 33 3% of the total debt  
We've gone from $10 trillion that the president inherited from all prior presidents to $16 trillion @MittRomney 
Forty seven million now on food stamps  When he came to office there were 32 million  He's added 15 million people  @MittRomney 

Remember while @BarackObama is lauding himself tonight with self indulgent compliments we have our brave soldiers fighting in Afghanistan  
After @BarackObama's speech tonight which should be well delivered reality will hit Friday morning when the new jobs report is released  
The delegates at the @DNC convention keep shouting Four More Years  Four more years of 18% real unemployment and another $6T in debt  
Now we will never know if @BarackObama would have been able to fill Bank of America Stadium  Pretty convenient  
 @BarackObama is now taking credit for changing party platform language but he reviewed it prior to the conventionhttp://drudge tw/TY2o4o  

Iran is flying supply planes to Syria through Iraqi airspace  Thank you  United States  for making this possible 
Bill Clinton did a great job last night the Democrats are lucky to have him  Do you really believe he likes @BarackObama  

Other networks are begging me to do a show I can't because I'm doing the Apprentice 
Change before you have to  Jack Welch 
Scary thought is the sexual pervert Anthony Weiner now in Charlotte  Did he bring his phone with him  
The Democrats dropped all references to God from their platform  Not good 

Better off  The $16T US debt works out to $136 260 per household  a 50% increase since @BarackObama took office  
North Carolina is a fantastic state with wonderful people  I enjoy my time there when I visit Trump National Charlotte  
I wish the 23 million who are unemployed were able to celebrate like the Democrats in Charlotte right now  
Almost every T V  show is asking me to go on especially the @Late_Show  It's simple I get the ratings 

With all the talk of fiscal responsibility at the @DNC convention yesterday  it was ironic that the debt passed $16T  
 @lancearmstrong  revise your decision to quit go back and fight  
Why does US doping agency destroy an American icon  @lancearmstrong  for events that took place years ago in France  
 @lancearmstrong teammate is angry and jealous he is no Lance  
Very good speech by @MichelleObama and under great pressure Dems should be proud 

July U S  construction had biggest drop in 12months  Bad indicator on economic numbers for rest of the year  
What message does it send when @BarackObama's campaign has to spin whether America is better off than it was 4 years ago  
OPEC is better off than they were 4 years ago  Gas has more than doubled during @BarackObama's term  Outrageous 
The Chinese are better off than they were 4 years ago  They have stolen even more from us in jobs & trade during @BarackObama's term  

NBC Wall St Journal Poll of African American voters: 94% @BarackObama  0% @MittRomney Even worse than Hillary's old numbers  Is that racism  
With our national debt passing $16T during the @DNC convention  @BarackObama has amassed more debt than the first 42 presidents  Scary  
Record setting gas prices in the U S  we're really looking dumb  Lots of $'s being made on us  
The media can track down @PaulRyan's old girlfriend and marathon time but can't find @BarackObama's college applications or other info  
Smart move by @BarackObama having Pres  Bill Clinton deliver the @DNC convention keynote  
This week the @DNC convention will deliver hard hits on @MittRomney  @RNC will regret being soft on @BarackObama last week  
 @RobinRoberts of @GMA is terrific get better soon  
 @BarackObama claims to have policies for working people    

Is this Hope & Change  A record 46 7M Americans were on food stamps this past June  We must do better  
Why does @BarackObama have such a fascination with my plane  He is more than welcomed to come for a ride  
Joe Paterno's family should sue the idiots @PennState that made that ridiculous deal and commissioned the one sided report

@MELANIATRUMP on @QVC tonight with her fabulous Melania Timepieces & Jewelry  Tune in at 1AM EST 
Republicans are always saying Obama is such a nice guy  When will they learn that he is not  
Andy Roddick   a great tennis player is a fantastic guy with a wonderful wife  
Republicans should have been much tougher on Obama  Just wait until you see what Obama does to Romney at the DNC 

 @BarackObama's assault on coal and gas and oil will send energy and manufacturing jobs to China  @MittRomney 
I am sure the Chinese are getting anxious  They watch the polls  @MittRomney won't let them cheat us anymore  
We have all the cards  Now is the time to make a great deal with Iran  
 @GovMikeHuckabee was great the other night  People love him  
Obama's ideas don't move us 'Forward ' they take us 'Backwards ' These are ideas people come to America to get away from  @marcorubio

I am impressed with how clearly @PaulRyanVP explains the challenges we face and the solutions @MittRomney will bring as President  
Book on Bin Laden is a terrible violation of code makes @BarackObama's story a big lie  
I wonder what @JoeBiden was thinking last night as @PaulRyanVP delivered that knockout speech  Joe should call in sick for the VP debate  
After four years of getting the run around  America needs a turnaround  and the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney  @PaulRyanVP 
The dummies left Iraq (and Libya) without the oil 
Let me say it as clearly as possible  that the attack on my Catholic brothers and sisters is an attack on me  @GovMike Huckabee 
Congratulations to @GovMikeHuckabee on last night's tremendous speech  Mike united the party faithful and explained that we can do better  
Only two weeks until we start shooting @CelebApprentice  We really have something amazing for the fans this year  
Gas prices are way too high  With an economy contracting and lower demand  how do OPEC & the speculators get away with this  

It's Thursday and again I ask how much money is China stealing from us  
I was putting together my early deals in New York & I was advised by many that I was too young  Believe in yourself & you can do anything  

I am astonished that the media continues to lie  @BarackObama gutted welfare reform  It is a fact 
America needs @MittRomney and @PaulRyanVP and we need them right now  @GovChristie 
No one will work harder  No one will move heaven and earth like Mitt Romney to make this country a better place to live @AnnDRomney 
New business start ups at the lowest level in 30 years and the EPA is now the Employment Prevention Agency  @bobmcdonnell 
It's Wednesday  how much money is China stealing from us today  
Great speech by my good friend @GovChristie  He did something you won't hear at @BarackObama's convention tell the truth  

Congratulations to @AnnDRomney on delivering a knock out speech last night  America can't wait to call her our First Lady  

China must be worried that @MittRomney will win this November  They have never had such a pushover like @BarackObama  

 @BarackObama's dismal job record is reason alone that he must be defeated this November  
I am very worried that if @BarackObama is re elected then Medicare will be destroyed  We must take care of our seniors  


I stand ready to lead us down a new path  where we are lifted up by our desire to succeed  not by a resentment of success  @MittRomney 
It's Tuesday how much inflation has @BarackObama's spending caused today on the price of food and gas  
 @GovChristie is going to do a fantastic job tonight explaining why @MittRomney should be elected and @BarackObama has to go  
 @MELANIATRUMP and I are looking forward to watching @AnnDRomney's speech tonight  She is an amazing woman who will be a great First Lady 
Happy to hear that @ralphreed's Faith and Freedom chapters are at the @RNC convention supporting @MittRomney  We must be united to win

The US Navy wants to go green  Our Navy should use the best & most powerful fuel & not play games  Give me a break

OPEC has just raised oil to over $102/Barrel  And @BarackObama still won't approve the Keystone Pipeline  Does he want high gas prices  
Why are we building a $1Billion embassy in Iraq when the country kicked us out  didn't give us any oil & is about to get taken over by Iran  
3 Chief of Staffs in less than 3 years of being President: Part of the reason why @BarackObama can't manage to pass his agenda

Michele Bachmann got less than 1 200 more votes in the Caucus than she did in the Ames Straw Poll  Very sad for her a nice woman

My @FoxNews interview with @gretawire discussing how @BarackObama is delusional and how a 3rd party candidate can win http://bit ly/uGCgId  
Barney Frank looked disgusting nipples protruding in his blue shirt before Congress  Very very disrespectful  

He is delusional: @BarackObama believes that he is the 4th best POTUS ever  
The WH yesterday defended Biden's comments that the Taliban aren't our enemy  When did the American people decide this http://fxn ws/v93Olk  


I really enjoyed last night's Tele Town Hall with @ralphreed's Faith and Freedom Coalition  Thanks to the thousands who joined  
I still can't believe we didn't t take the oil from Iraq  




Joe Biden said that the Taliban 'is not our enemy ' I wonder how our troops in Afghanistant that are under attack view Biden's statement  
What a shock The U S  Capitol Christmas tree pays homage @BarackObama but failed to mention Jesus  
He thinks that the wealth you create belongs to the gov't  @BarackObama doesn't respect the fact that the money he wastes belongs to us  







China taxing imports from the US 22% why aren't we taxing China  
Dummies left Iraq without the oil not believable 
Iraq in political turmoil one day after we leave I told you so  
Even @BarackObama's former National Security Advisor Jim Jones has called the Keystone pipeline 'a national must ' America needs it  

Barney Frank admited that ObamaCare does have 'death panels' yesterday  Obamacare must be fully repealed or healthcare will be destroyed  
With a record deficit and $15 trillion in debt  @BarackObama is spending $4 million of our money on his Hawaii vacation  Just plain wrong

So biased: @TIME made 'The Protester' as the person of the year  @TIME celebrates OWS but vilified the Tea Party last year  

If speeches and memoirs created jobs then @BarackObama would be Ronald Reagan  



With the number of tweets sad sack @Rosie has done  she has totally lost control of herself hopefully not a breakdown  





The habitual vacationer  @BarackObama  has sacrificed so much  He is delaying his 17 day Hawaii vacation a couple of hours

Donald Trump  I think  would be fairer than a lot of the folks that have been moderating debates over the past few months  @RickSantorum

Third quarter GDP was lowered to 2%   There won't be any economic recovery until @BarackObama is defeated  
Why does @BarackObama support the radical Islamists in Egypt protests yet has such a high disregard for the Tea Party  
Washington will continue to run record deficits into the election  We are borrowing at a rate of $1 40 from China  Truly unsustainable  
Iran will soon take all of the oil in Iraq   and Iraq itself Keep the oil  



American sanctions alone cannot stop Iran's nuclear drive and @BarackObama cannot get China and Russia to agree on new Iranian sanctions  


I dictate my tweets to my executive assistant and she posts them  Time is money The Art of the Deal  

The habitual vacationer @BarackObama spent 9 days before the critical Super Committee deadline traveling  He failed to lead  again  

Yesterday @BarackObama actually spent a full day in Washington  He didn't campaign  fund raise or play golf  Shocking  


Egypt is turning into a hot bed of radical Islam  The current protest is another coup attempt  We should never have abandoned Mubarak  
The House's failure to pass the Balance Budget Amendment was another unforced error by the GOP  Very disappointing  
When the Super Committee fails  @BarackObama will get exactly what he really wants automatic cuts in defense spending  This is his plan  
If @BarackObama wanted the Super Committee to succeed  he would have lead  Instead he has been campaigning  Where is the leadership  

The Super Committee is finding ways to raise all our taxes without admitting it  The Republicans made a big mistake agreeing to this deal  
ObamaCare is one of the greatest threats our country faces  It is unsustainable and will lead America into complete insolvency  
@TheDailyShow @Lawrence Panama is not a Trump development  We only manage it after it is built  They also licensed the name  

There was no need for violence at the OWS protests  Some are looking to make trouble  Time to go home

@Israel faces an existential threat in Iran's nuclear drive  Unfortunately @BarackObama is no friend of Israel  

Crude has skyrocketed since @BarackObama delayed the Keystone Pipeline  Not only are 20 000 jobs gone  but family budgets are tightening  
The Federal government has increased its employment by 12% since 2007  We need to stop replacing retired workers unless position is needed

I'm looking forward to seeing you all this afternoon at Macy's Herald Square  5:30 pm at the Crystal department on 8  
@BarackObama will hear loud and clear today the message NY 9 is sending by electing @Bobturner9th @Israel is our friend and ally  


The White House is continuing to be openly uncooperative with the Fast and Furious investigation  American lives were lost  We need answers  

How can the economy ever recover when @BarackObama keeps threatening the private sector with more taxes  This is no way to spur growth  
I'm urging my friends in Brooklyn to vote for Bob Turner tomorrow send @barackobama a message  
Friends in NY 9  let @BarackObama know that you don't approve of his mistreatment of @Israel  Vote for @Bobturner9th tomorrow 
The American economy would grow if Washington didn’t keep threatening higher taxes and more regulations  Government is not the solution  


The World Economic Forum now ranks the US the fifth most competitive economy in the world  We have fallen from first under @BarackObama  
Iran’s nuclear program must be stopped – by any and all means necessary  
Very exciting  I will be at Macy’s Herald Square this Wednesday at 5:30pm to celebrate the launch of Trump Home crystal 
Want jobs  Slash corporate tax rate  Tax incentives for companies that create jobs in US  America will boom  
@BarackObama the stimulus will fail  just like the first  
I watched POTUS speech from Europe same old tax and spend won't create jobs  
@IvankaTrump always makes me proudhttp://bit ly/pWz8Xi  
Why is the UN planning to attack @Israel's sovereignty and ignore Iran's nuclear program  The US should look at future funding  
China is happy to learn that @BarackObama plans to borrow another $300 Billion  @BarackObama is their favorite client  
If only speeches could create jobs then @BarackObama wouldn't have such a dismal economic record  

My interview with @gretawire last night on @FoxNews: @BarackObama 'Missed His Opportunity'http://bit ly/oTjwin  
America needs a tough negotiator not a community organizer  
Why was @BarackObama selling guns to Mexican drug dealers  
A robust growing economy is how to fix Social Security and Medicare not cuts on Seniors  
US should have told Libya Rebels give us 50% of your oil for our military support  

@BarackObama trillion $ stimulus was supposed to create jobs instead it gave us more debt and higher unemployment  

@BarackObama wishes speeches could create jobs  His job is costing America all of ours  
Fast and Furious gun running goes all the way to the White House  We need answers now 
Oil is double the price now compared to last year OPEC is laughing at @BarackObama  
Fast and Furious put semi automatics in the hands of Mexican drug lords that killed Americans @BarackObama should answer all questions  
The White House is predicting 9% unemployment throughout 2012 – and when Obama Care takes effect in 2014 expect it to go even higher  
Make no mistake Fast and Furious goes ALL the way to the White House  
@BarackObama is so inept that I think he simply made a mistake in originally scheduling the Joint Session on September 7th  Just sad  

We must stand firm against the UN's ploy to sabotage Israel if the UN grants the PA statehood then we must immediately defund it  
I'll be on Greta Van Susteren's show tonight at 10 PM on FoxNews  Tune in  

Libya is being taken over by Islamic radicals with @BarackObama's open support  

China's business interests reach far and wide even domestically within our borders  We need to reassess our relationship  
The new Libyan Government should turn over the Lockerbie bomber now  
ObamaCare must be fully repealed or it will destroy America's small businesses  
If the UN unilaterally grants the Palestinians statehood  then the US should cut off all its funding  Actions have consequences  
If the Palestinians want statehood then why are they run by the terrorist group Hamas  
Crude is at $85 right now – isn’t even worth half that  OPEC is ripping us off  
@BarackObama MUST release a budget before @johnboehner begins negotiations on a continuing appropriations resolution  

Libyan Rebels should have given us 50% of the oil in return for our military support we don't even ask 

More and more Americans seem fed up with both Parties I agree  
There is no substitute for private sector experience  
Why did @BarackObama and his family travel separately to Martha's Vineyard  They love to extravagantly spend on the taxpayers' dime  

America needs a President who can negotiate better deals for the American People  
China's corporate espionage is a continued threat to the American economy  With the right leadership  it can be stopped  
@BarackObama inherited $10 6 Trillion in National Debt will leave after his first term with the Debt at over $17 6 Trillion  
There usually is an easy solution to every problem  For instance  a lot of our country's problems can be solved in next year's election  
We have spent over $1 Billion on the Libya operation  What are we getting back  

As bad as Qaddafi was what comes next in Libya will be worse just watch  
Let's not start celebrating over Libya until we see who takes over  
We spent over a billion on Libya and lead the way why is Europe getting the oil  
@RonPaul has some serious ideas which deserve serious consideration  Wrong for media to ignore him  
We don't need another stimulus  The first one was a complete failure  Why repeat the same mistake  

Israel is being barraged by rockets from Gaza recently  They must respond accordingly in defense of their citizens  
@BarackObama is sure a master delegator  He has sent @Joe_Biden to China  The Chinese are laughing at us  We MUST do better  
@BarackObama’s new job plan will certainly do the following – 1  Not create any jobs  2  Borrow more money from China   

Insurgents in Iraq show they can still mount horrifying attacks US wastes trillions  
Many people have been asking to see my plane  The Apprentice's @AmandaTMiller will give you a tour   http://bit ly/qtiqO6  
Karl Rove lost GOP both Houses of Congress and the White House gave us Obama  

Ron Paul is right when he says we are wasting lives and money in Iraq and Afghanistan  
My interview with @gretawire on Fox News for those who missed it 'Obama's Constantly on Vacation'http://bit ly/qR8arA  
@BarackObama has a record low 39% Gallup approval rating  Why so high  

Amazing Obama speaks  market goes DOWN Trump tells CNBC he's buying stock market goes UP should not be that way 



China is a threat to America  They are not our friend  
Unemployment is plaguing both Black and Hispanic youths  Very troubling  

@BarackObama played golf yesterday  Now he heads to a 10 day vacation in Martha's Vineyard  Nice work ethic  
Reporters say it's the Trump Bump I tell CNBC I am buying stocks and the market goes up  
Economic growth can save Social Security  Medicare and America  
Mike Huckebee  a great guy  said the President should appoint me Treasury Secretary  China and OPEC would not be happy  
Ron Paul is right that we are wasting trillions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan  
Obama has no understanding of how to create jobs or opportunity  He believes in Government  
It's easy to see why Americans are sick of career politicians and both parties  
How will Mitt Romney defend his record on jobs and Romneycare in tonight's debate  
Looking forward to the GOP debate and the outcome of the Ames straw poll  We must get a real leader  


The Fed continues to flood the market with US dollars  Wrong move  
Oil is starting to rise again despite the horrible times  OPEC continues to rip us off  Not worth $30  New leadership needed  
Congress should get back to Washington  but @BarackObama doesn't want to interrupt his vacation in Martha's Vineyard  







The S&P downgrade is a direct result of @BarackObama's increased reckless budget spending and Obama Care  He owns this  

Obama Care is already having a devastating impact on our economy  


America's debt officially became 100% of our GDP on @BarackObama's 50th birthday coincidence  

Thanks to Giovanni's Coal Fire Pizza of Florida for donating enough pizza to feed 750 Police Athletic League youngsters in NY this Friday  
Watch my interview with Greta Van Susteren on her show  On the Record  tonight on Fox News in the 10 p m  hour  

Morning Joe Panel is stealing many of my statements and ideas to better America without giving credit the story of my life 
Republicans gave Obama a free pass to the White House they just don't get it  
I believe America can be great only with proper leadership  
Wake Up America China is eating our lunch  
All those politicians in Washington and not one good negotiator  

No taxes the only good thing about DC Debt Deal  

The more you learn about the debt deal  the worse it gets  

Republicans and Democrats have both created our economic problems  
Why should we have any defense cuts in any deal  America must remain strong  
This is the best deal the Republicans could get  
Disappointed in GOP and Dems Giving Obama power to raise the debt limit next year is a mistake  
Ex Presidential Pollster Pat Cadell says most voters sick of both parties and their failure  
We need economic growth and jobs not blue ribbon panels to study the problem  
No taxes in Boehner or Reid Plan important victory for America  
Watched Sean Hannity last night a great guy  
If Obama has to re fight this fight next year he loses Watch the fine details in every deal The Art of the Deal 
Blue Ribbon Commission to find and agree to future spending cuts  Bad idea  
Never quit and always hit back The Art of the Comeback 
I just got Mike Leach's new book  Swing Your Sword  He's a great coach  and he's written a great book  It's definitely worth reading  

@BarackObama has not released his own debt plan yet  He's totally lost  ineffective  desperate  GOP has its best chance to make a great deal 
My wife Melania Trump's show was a tremendous success last night  In case you missed her  you can see her again tonight on @QVC at 7 pm ET 
@Johnboehner The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it  The Art of the Deal 

@KarlRove's @CrossroadsGPS new ad criticizes Obama for his excessive spending and debt  borrowing from China  Didn't Bush do the same thing  

People ask me every day to pose for pictures but the camera never works the first time they are never prepared or maybe just very nervous 
Know when to walk away from the table  The Art of the Deal 
Watch my wife Melania Trump tonight on @QVC at 1 a m  So proud of her 
Higher Taxes kill job creation cut wild government spending and waste  
China has so much of our debt that they can't put us in default w/o killing themselves US needs our toughest negotiator and fast 
America's debt is greater than our GDP  Time for new thinking  


Fiscal mismanagement of cash costing US Taxpayer billions cut fraud and waste before cutting funding for Seniors  
Obama  sadly  has no business or private sector background and it shows  

The Answer to both Social Security and Medicare is a robust growing economy not cuts on the elderly  
We need a balanced budget Amendment because Congress has no fiscal discipline  
Unfortunately@BarackObama's continued attack on the US $ will lead to ever rising gas prices at the pump and lots of other really bad things 
Ronald Kessler's new book The Secrets of the FBI is a great book that should be read by everyone  
Increasing America’s debt weakens us domestically and internationally  US Senator @BarackObama  2007 

The Gang of Six yet another unmitigated disaster  ANY DEAL NEEDS TO REPEAL OBAMACARE  T E A  
China is our enemy they want to destroy us Redstate Interview 
Obama is addicted to spending America into insolvency  His record proves it  
Robust Economic growth is the answer to the Medicare Problem not cuts on the elderly  
While @BarackObama seeks to further destroy our credit  our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs  Such a total failure as a President  
@johnboehner @EricCantor You can't con people   if you don't deliver the goods  people will eventually catch on  The Art of the Deal 
So China is ordering us to raise the Debt Limit   How low have we as a nation sunk  
The GOP doesn't waste an opportunity to waste an opportunity  Defunding Obamacare should be central to any deal  
Every dollar @BarackObama spends costs $1 40 with interest borrowed from China on our children and grandchildren's backs  CUT CAP BALANCE 
@BarackObama has sold guns to Mexican drug lords while his DOJ erodes our 2nd Amendment rights  

Congratulations to my daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared on the birth of their daughter Arabella Rose yesterday  
@marcorubio is right  We need to create more taxpayers  not more taxes  CUT  CAP AND BALANCE http://onforb es/pBvGuq  
@BarackObama You have increased discretionary spending by 25% annually and amassed over $4 trillion in debt  T E Ahttp://on wsj com/onsY3b  

What is better advice The Art of the Deal or Rules for Radicals   I know which one @BarackObama prefers  
CUT  CAP AND BALANCE  TAXED ENOUGH ALREADY 

US News named the Top10 best hotels in the US and Trump Int'l Hotel & Tower NYC and Trump Int'l Hotel & Tower Chicago are on the list 
@BarackObama You have abandoned Israel and engaged the Muslim Brotherhood  and even the Arab world does not like ithttp://politi co/qUTXsA  

My interview last night with Greta on the GOP going El Foldohttp://bit ly/oprTzh  
@johnboehner Debt Ceiling Sometimes no deal is better than a bad deal  

@macmiller Donald Trump the Song gets 16M hits on YouTube  Who wouldn't be flattered  
@johnboehner Much as it pays to emphasize the positive  there are times when the only choice is confrontation  The Art of the Deal 
@johnboehner Mr  Speaker  bring the Balanced Budget Amendment to the floor for a vote Let's get the ball rolling  


House GOP wants to cut Medicare  Obama took $500 billion from Medicare for Obamacare  Both Wrong 


@johnboehner Message for House GOP The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it  The Art of the Deal  
If only @Obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening Israel's borders then America would be on the path to solvency  
THe Art of the Deal The best thing you can do is deal from strength  and leverage is the biggest strength you have  CUT  CAP and BALANCE  
Republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @BarackObama in today's debt talks First and foremost CUT CAP and BALANCE  
Congress is back TIME TO CUT  CAP AND BALANCE There is no revenue problem The Debt Limit cannot be raised until Obama spending is contained  
Perhaps this is the kind of thinking we need in Washington    http://on wsj com/ldLEoy
