Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION  CLINTON 27.8 MILLION  Thank you

NATO commander agrees members should pay up via @dcexaminer:http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/nato-commander-agrees-members-should-pay-up/article/2598183?custom_click=rss … 
 Wow 
 The   Rust Belt   was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico END  
 Crooked's stop in Johnstown 

Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA 
 I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics 
 Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two   Big Thursdays   when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings  

 Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime 
 Violent crime is rising across the United States 
Just got back from Colorado The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible Big crowds 
 While I am in OH & PA - you can also join @Mike_Pence in Nevada on Mon 


 Join me Monday in Columbus 


American homeownership rate in Q2 2016 was 62.9% - lowest rate in 51yrs WE will bring back the  'American Dream!'pic.twitter.com/yI4Q8FHRjp 
We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not 
 Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters Her foreign wars 
NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes  
 Colorado was amazing yesterday So much support Our tax 

 Thank you Denver 

 As usual 

Hillary Clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts 
 Thank you to the amazing law enforcement officers in Colorado 



 Even Bill is tired of the lies 
 Join me in Colorado Springs at 2pm- or in Denver tonight at 7pm 


What Bernie Sanders really thinks of Crooked Hillary Clinton.pic.twitter.com/VgMaAsZBep 
 I am watching Crooked Hillary speak Same old stuff 
 Wow 

The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech He wishes he didn't make that deal 
 Thank you  


 Crooked Hillary said that I   couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign   Really 
 If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York 
   Little   Michael Bloomberg 
 General John Allen 
Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech Many of her statements were lies and fabrications 

   @AnnCoulter:   I believe in science   Dem code for   we're shutting down coal mines 
 CAMPAIGN STATEMENT:  

 Two policemen just shot in San Diego 
 Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me 
The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD 
No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes 
 Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction 
 Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power 
Hillary will never reform Wall Street She is owned by Wall Street 
Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words 
 Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam 
 Departing now - thank you Cedar Rapids 



Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office It will only go further down under Clinton 
 A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP 
 AMERICA'S FUTURE 




   @trumplican2016: @realDonaldTrump @DavidWohl stay the course mr trump your message is resonating with the PEOPLE    

 Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty 
Shooting deaths of police officers up 78% this year We must restore law and order and protect our great law enforcement officers 
 Join me live in Toledo 


 Thank you Pennsylvania 



   Trump right: Illegal families crossing border set to double 
 Great new poll - thank you 

 If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33 
 Join our next Vice President 


Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one Pathetic 
 Our not very bright Vice President 
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about The danger is massive NO 
Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally Get tough 
The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country No recognition - SAD 
 Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said   Trump is a genius   America 1st  
 As I have been saying 
 Just like I have warned from the beginning 
Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena Did Bernie go home and go to sleep 
 I hate to say it 
 No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it 
 You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is 
 For the record 
 In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster 


Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here 
 Bernie's exhausted 
The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar 
 Thank you New Hampshire  

 Join us in Toledo 

 Join us tomorrow in Scranton 


Pocahontas bombed last night Sad to watch 
 Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS 
 Funny 
 Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton All of that work 
 Elizabeth Warren 
Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs 
 If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party 
I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me I said fine He then trashes on air 
 Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold He got NOTHING for all of the time 
 While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people 
 Clinton betrayed Bernie voters Kaine supports TPP 


 Thank you Roanoke 





 Great POLL numbers are coming out all over People don't want another four years of Obama 
The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE 
 Wow 
 Here we go again with another Clinton scandal 
 Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her   servant   was doing at the DNC - they just got caught 
 If Bernie Sanders 

Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened 
 How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails 
 The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails 
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes No way they are going to fix America's problems ISIS & all others laughing 
 The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good 
 The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that 
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well 
 Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength 
 Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top 
 If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails 
 The @CNN panels are so one sided 
 I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted 
 Today proves what I have always known 
 Sorry folks 
 There is no longer a Bernie Sanders   political revolution   He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure 
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates 
 Looks like the Bernie people will fight If not 
 Wow 
 Bernie Sanders started off strong 
The Crooked Hillary V.P choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H 


   @NancyNielsenn: @realDonaldTrump Dinesh D'Sousa Hillary's America see it    

Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night From the heart 
 The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her 
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together ISIS and our other enemies are drooling They don't look presidential to me 
I will bring jobs back and get wages up People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years Clinton killed jobs 
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved Job killer 
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs I will bring jobs back 
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania Against steelworkers and miners Husband signed NAFTA 
 Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders Mock his heritage and much more On-line from Wikileakes 
 Pocahontas wanted V.P slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate Also 
 Tim Kaine is 
 The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine 

I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn How to defeat radical Islam 
Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did 
 Another attack 
 One of the best produced 
Thank you Cleveland We love you and will be back many times 
What a great four days in Cleveland So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all The police and Secret Service were fantastic 





 Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses 
 Ted Cruz talks about the Constitution but doesn't say that if the Dems win the Presidency 
 I am soooo proud of my children 
 Great job @EricTrump Proud of you

 Our next Vice President of the United States of America 


 Wow 
 Great job @EricTrump Proud of you  




Thank you to Governor @ScottWalker for such warm support Great speech 




John Kasich was never asked by me to be V.P Just arrived in Cleveland - will be a great two days 
 STATEMENT ON MELANIA SPEECH 

The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails 
Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press 
 In November 
Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena More than in past years 
 Congratulations to my children 
Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States I will work hard and never let you down AMERICA FIRST 
The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention Very exciting 






   @RoxaneTancredi:  Democrats are coming to TRUMP I used to be proud of the dem party No more It is crooked and not for the people    
 It was truly an honor to introduce my wife 




Networks other than low ratings @CNN have been very fair and exciting 
 .@CNN is the worst.They go to their dumb 
 Looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife 
 Thank you Mahoning County 

 President Obama just had a news conference 
 Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching We are not looking good 

I will be on @60Minutes tonight at 7:00 P.M with Mike Pence talking about LAW AND ORDER and many other subjects Bad times for divided USA 
 We are TRYING to fight ISIS 
 We grieve for the officers killed in Baton Rouge today How many law enforcement and people have to 

The ratings at @FoxNews blow away the ratings of @CNN - not even close That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like 
 .@FoxNews is much better 
 If Goofy Elizabeth Warren 
 I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren 
 It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience 
 As the days and weeks go by 
We are going to have a great time in Cleveland Will lead to special results for our country We will Make America Great Again 
 Goofy Elizabeth Warren 
 Thank you to Jack Morgan 

Thank you to Chris Cox and Bikers for Trump - Your support has been amazing I will never forget MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 

 Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street 
 Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes 
 Crooked Hillary 
 Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience 
Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana) My first choice from start 
Look forward to Governor Mike Pence V.P introduction tomorrow in New York City 
I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate News conference tomorrow at 11:00 A.M 
Four more years of weakness with a Crooked Hillary Administration is not acceptable Look what has happened to the world with O & Hillary 

 My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice 
 In light of the horrible attack in Nice 
 Another horrific attack 
 I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS 
 Another new poll Thank you for your support Join the MOVEMENT today  

 Great new poll- thank you America 

I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan Details to follow 
 If I win the Presidency 
Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach What was she thinking 
Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct Big mistake by an incompetent judge 
On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party I am spending a lot myself and also helping others 
Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity 

Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common.pic.twitter.com/teoVCYXKOR 
Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves Think about it and let me know 
 The Republican platform is most  
pro-Israel of all time  
New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN 

 Thank you Florida 

Justice Ginsburg of the U.S Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me Her mind is shot - resign 

 Thank you Iowa- see you soon 


I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 8pm Enjoy 

 To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests 
Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton 
Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs 

I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters They are not happy that he is selling out 
 Bernie Sanders 
 This election is a choice between law 
 For too many years 
 Crime is out of control 


Senior United States District Judge Robert E Payne today ruled in favor of Trump campaign delegates who had argued..https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10157294436575725 … 
 Speech on Veterans' Reform: 

Great poll- Florida Thank you!pic.twitter.com/4FuPpL5WOM 
 Thoughts and prayers with the victims 
 Join me in Westfield 

 I heard that the underachieving John King of @CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies Happily 
 The media is so dishonest If I make a statement 
President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think He is living in a world of the make believe 
Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton We are a divided nation 


Way to go @serenawilliams  - you are a true champion Proud of you 
 MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN 

Isn't it sad that on a day of national tragedy Hillary Clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on @CNN 
 Due to the horrific events taking place in our country 
Last night's horrific execution-style shootings of 12 Dallas law enforcement officers...https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10157277205810725 … 
Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country 
 After today 
 Thank you Speaker @PRyan 



Just leaving D.C Had great meetings with Republicans in the House and Senate Very interesting day These are people who love our country 
 Great being in Cincinnati 
 Where is the outrage for this Disney book Is this the 'Star of David' also  

 To all of my twitter followers 
Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live 
 I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton Check it out Sleepy Eyes 
 Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd 
Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C Others to follow Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City 
 Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center 
 I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago 
 Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country She is sooooo guilty But watch 
 The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges 
 Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest 
 Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team   were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive 
Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong BAD JUDGEMENT 
 I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with   murder   Come November 8 
Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning Lots of support Win 
I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 11pm Enjoy 
 My son 
Looking forward to meeting with @SenBobCorker in a little while We will be traveling to North Carolina together today 

 The system is rigged General Petraeus got in trouble for far less Very very unfair As usual 
It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S Will see her again 
Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary A total disgrace 
 On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M   Special: Meet the Trumps   Hope you enjoy  
Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary She is flying with him tomorrow Who pays 
 With Hillary and Obama 
 Crooked Hillary Clinton is   guilty as hell   but the system is totally rigged and corrupt Where are the 33 
The only people who are not interested in being the V.P pick are the people who have not been asked 
I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa 
 Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday Very impressed 
 Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd 
 Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star 

Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever We need change 
 The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS 200 dead in Baghdad 
 In Bangladesh 
I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught 
 The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting   go away 
 Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G talked only about   grandkids   and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac  
   THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED    
 On Saturday a great man 
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G to work out a deal The system is totally rigged & corrupt 
Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know 
 Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd 
 It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton Like I said 
It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton What she did was wrong What Bill did was stupid 

 Thank you for your support 



 Crooked Hillary -- Makes History  



 The speakers slots at the Republican Convention are totally filled 
 Just read in the failing @nytimes that I was not aware   the event had to be held in Cleveland   - a total lie These people are sick  

Just returned from Colorado Amazing crowd 




 Yet another terrorist attack today in Israel -- a father 


.@TraceAdkins great job on FOX this morning Keep up the good work 
Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton The system is totally rigged Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence 
Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter 
 As Bernie Sanders said 

I will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on FOX Enjoy 
 The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple 
I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx $50 million loan I have totally terminated the loan 
The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign Done deal 
 One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America  

Why would college graduates want Crooked Hillary as their President She will destroy them!http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/06/28/graduates-staple-green-cards-hillary-clinton/ … 

The story with Hillary will never change.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/28/hillary-clintons-email-story-continues-to-get-harder-and-harder-to-believe/ … 
 For reasons only they can explain 
Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine Thank you to everyone for making it so special 
   @Gengm7: @jakeda @realDonaldTrump As of April this year 
I will be on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 P.M Enjoy 
ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will Not capable 
 Will be in Bangor 

Just watched Senator John Barrasso on @FoxNews - He was great Thank you John 
Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters 
 The @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker China 
Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was The media makes everything up 
   @jtsbk:  @AllenWest thanks for sharing Eric we need @realDonaldTrump now as this administration is incapable of keeping our country safe    
We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States 
 Yet another terrorist attack 
the world ever realize what is going on So sad  
 Hillary Clinton’s Presidency would be catastrophic for 
the future of our country She is ill-fit with bad judgment  
 Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure It just 
never seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton

.@CNN is all negative when it comes to me I don't watch it anymore 
 The media is unrelenting They will only go with and report a story in a negative light I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong) 
 Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S Senate 

   @w4djt:   Under a Trump presidency 
   @brazosboys: Hillary read   sigh   off the Teleprompter 

 The   dirty   poll done by @ABC @washingtonpost is a disgrace Even they admit that many more Democrats were polled Other polls were good  

Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong I said LEAVE will win She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement Only a question of time 
 Hillary Clinton is not a change agent 
 People in our country want borders 

The @ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats  Very dishonest - why would they do that Other polls good 
 Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry Shows me hitting shot 
Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads Disgraceful 
 Crooked Hillary Clinton 
 George Will 
 Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland Turnberry came out magnificently My son 
Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs That ends when I am President

Here is another CNN lie The Clinton News Network is losing all credibility I’m not watching it much anymore.http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/06/23/cnns-clinton-cash-fact-check-ends-embarrassment-cristina-alesci-laurie-frankel/ … 
 CNN 
Our inner cities have been left behind We will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border 
 On immigration 
& our wage-earners Hillary Clinton is consulting with Wall Street  
 Obama & Clinton should stop meeting with special interests 

 SC has kept us safe from exec amnesty--for now But Hillary has pledged to expand it 
 Hillary Lies to Benghazi Families 


 ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama    --  Donald J Trump  
   Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency    --   Donald J Trump  
 Thank you to Donald Rumsfeld for the endorsement Very much appreciated Clinton's conduct has been   disqualifying    
   @AllegrettiVicki: You have great children 

   @justininglv: @realDonaldTrump great speech today It's all about America and that's why you will become president    Thank you  



   @chrisboydbrew: @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness Saw your interview.You are the best Great questions 
Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy 
I will be interviewed by @LouDobbs tonight on @FoxBusiness 7pm ET 
 Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich Corrupt 
 If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty & judgment 
Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays 
 I am   the king of debt  That has been great for me as a businessman 

Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe 
How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk 
 Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as 
Secretary of State 
 Hillary says this election is about judgment  She's right  Her judgement has killed thousands 
I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton 
 Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament 
 When I said that if 
.@DJohnsonPGA We are so proud of you Dustin Your reaction under pressure was amazing First of many Majors You are a true CHAMPION 

 Yesterday's failing @NYTimes fraudulently shows an empty room prior to my speech 
How can the NY Times show an empty room hours before my speech even started when they knew it was going to be packed So totally dishonest

Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women She is a total fraud

Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do

 I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes 
The media is on a new phony kick about my management style I spend much less money & get much better results What we need as Prez 
 The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style & that I don't have many people I have 73 
I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go Thank you

 How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA 
 Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.If so 


Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders Will be another bad day for her 
Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S political history 
Oregon is voting today Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts My hit was on China 
 The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line   You can tell them to go BLANK themselves   - was about China 
 Wow 

 What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly 
 I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y construction job 
   In politics 
 The writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes 
Over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6 That’s because there were so many positive statements 
 No wonder the @nytimes is failing—who can believe what they write after the false 
The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women 
 Rowanne Brewer 
 Thank you 
 With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me 
 A political commentator for @cnn 
 Wow 
 The @nytimes is so dishonest Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer 
That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is 
 Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems The system is rigged against him He should run as an independent Run Bernie 
 Great new poll- thank you 

The @washingtonpost report on potential VP candidates is wrong Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration 
 Thank you Georgia See you soon 

 The media is really on a witch-hunt against me False reporting 
Why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers DISHONEST 
 Wow 
Why doesn't the failing @nytimes write the real story on the Clintons and women The media is TOTALLY dishonest 

   @tzard000: @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Everyone continues to pile onto Donald 
Everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.I gave them many names of women I helped-refused to use

 Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday 


 If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren 
 In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete 
Isn’t it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump & gets nothing done in Senate 
Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage See media—asking for increase 
 Our Native American Senator 
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman’s card like her friend crooked Hillary See her dumb tweet “when a woman stands up to you…” 
 If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been 
Thanks Piers.https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/730465526993039360 … 

Goofy Elizabeth Warren didn’t have the guts to run for POTUS Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold 
Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S Senate She has done nothing 
I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary His time will come 
 Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska Get ready for November - Crooked Hillary

It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position 
 It was Rosie O'Donnell who ate the cake in the vicious Hillary commercial about me 
 Why does the media 

 Get out and vote Nebraska 
 Get out and vote West Virginia 


I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current 
I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people 
 If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton 
Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump But I had 17 people to beat—she had one

Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant She is too easy I'm driving her nuts 
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me 
 Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant 
 Goofy Elizabeth Warren 
Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American I say she’s a fraud 
I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate I will defeat them both 
 Response to @LindseyGrahamSC: 

I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win 
 Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed

 Thank you for a great day yesterday 


How bad is the New York Times—the most inaccurate coverage constantly Always trying to belittle Paper has lost its way 
 Thank you for the incredible support- Melania 
 Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates & otherwise He should show them 

 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 

 The Cruz-Kasich pact is under great strain This joke of a deal is falling apart 
 Thank you Wilkes-Barre 

 Get out and VOTE tomorrow We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN  


 Thank you West Chester 


 Thank you Warwick 


On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night 
Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him Typical politician - can't make a deal work 
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses 
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one Shows weakness 
Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them Sad 
 Wow 
I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down Becoming irrelevant 
   @DiamondandSilk: .@DonaldJTrumpJr awesome job on @CNNSotu DonaldTrump has integrity & he refuses 2 play the game call   Delegate Bribery    

I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally Things are looking good for Tuesday 
.@AndreBauer  Great job and advice on @CNN @jaketapper  Thank you 
.@Borisep was great on @JudgeJeanine tonight Very smart commentary that will prove to be correct 
 As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads 
I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut Looking for a big vote on Tuesday

 Thank you 

 Thank you for the incredible support 

I met Prince on numerous occasions He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy He will be greatly missed 
Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237 Now he can't get to 1237 Drop out LYIN' Ted 
Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify 
Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race He said Kasich should get out for same reason I think both should get out 
 I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife 

We are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to Indiana 
Had a meeting with the terrific @GovPenceIN of Indiana So excited to campaign in his wonderful state!pic.twitter.com/73uCyV6ql4

Lyin’ Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help So many New Yorkers devastated Cruz hates New York 
 New York 
Kasich only looks O.K in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him 
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead Hillary would destroy him & K 
   @DiamondandSilk: .@realDonaldTrump is who we need 2 fix this corrupted 
 Thank you for today's endorsement 

 Thank you 

I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie 
Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me I am the one person she doesn't want to run against Will be such fun 
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses It won't work 
 Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary Despite a rigged delegate system 
 I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning 

 Thank you California 

 See you tomorrow Dutchess County

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M Enjoy 
The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians Biggest story in politics This will not be allowed 
How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary Great anger - totally unfair 

I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign Bad system 
The @nytimes purposely covers me so inaccurately I want other nations to pay the U.S for our defense of them We are the suckers-no more

 A great honor to visit the 9/11 Memorial Museum with my wife

 Isn't it a shame that the person who will have by far the most delegates and many millions more votes than anyone else

 Explain how the women on The View 
 .@TheView T.V show 
 Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years TIME FOR A CHANGE 
   @TimVincent56:  @LindseyGrahamSC Talkers think about the future 
 It is amazing how often I am right 
 Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a   hell hole   and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article I was so right  
 These politicians like Cruz and Graham 
 .@LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION Both talk about ISIS 
It is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T.V shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run 
   @missi51: .@realDonaldTrump thank God is not a politician 
 We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O Why It is time to renegotiate 
N.A.T.O is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on

I want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win Could not have done it without you Joe 
 While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates 
 I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted Jeb spent more than $150 
 I will be the best by far in fighting terror I’m the only one that was right from the beginning 
Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror She’s been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are 
 Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates 
 Lyin’ Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me 
 Thank you 


Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q model photo post of Melania That's why we call him Lyin' Ted 
 Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November 
 Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona Thank you 
 Thank you 

 Incompetent Hillary 
 Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q shoot in his ad Be careful 

 Obama 







I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and it’s not even close Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

Senator @LindseyGrahamSC made horrible statements about @SenTedCruz – and then he endorsed him No wonder nobody trusts politicians

 Please explain to the dummies at the @WSJ  Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won 
 .@WSJ is bad at math The good news is 
 .@WSJ Editorial says   Clinton primary vote total is 8 
The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem 
Crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that  @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough 
Great news that @FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate How many times can the same people ask the same question I beat Cruz debating 
Crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse Ted can't win

   @CreativeXwalk: @realDonaldTrump teaching the GOP how to lose four years ago was not enough Now Romney wants to do it again    
The phony lawsuit against Trump U could have been easily settled by me but I want  to go to court 98% approval rating by students Easy win 
Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago 
 I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton I am not a Mitt Romney 
 Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who 
 I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party 
 Failed candidate Mitt Romney 
   @malski1954: I changed parties to vote for you 
Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected Not a good messenger 
Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio & Cruz.When you see them think of your puppet POLS 
   @Johnsmi01433966: The establishment doesn't like you because they can't control you and get you to lie to us and keep ripping us off    
 Because of me 


 I would love to see the Republican party and everyone get together- and unify 

Just another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten Barrack Obama (2/2) 
Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney is having a news conference tomorrow to criticize me (1/2) 

.@CNN poll just hit 49% for Trump Interesting how my numbers have gone so far up since lightweight Marco Rubio has turned nasty Love it 

 Why can't the leaders of the Republican Party see that I am bringing in new voters by the millions-we are creating a larger 


   @KinnardJan: @Itsjoeco @realDonaldTrump I took Trump University class and saved my home    
 Marco Rubio lost big last night I even beat him in Virginia 
 Why would anyone in Florida vote for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio Check out his credit card scam 
The special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T.V ads on me 
   @JoeNBC: FOX calls Virginia for Trump If it holds 

   @NorahODonnell: Looks like Rubio won't get any delegates from TX or AL because he didn't meet 20% threshold

   @EmaGabi23: Rubio was kicking back on his $80k boat he bought with lobbyist money and claimed it was from book sale profit lol    
Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is polling very poorly in Florida The people can't stand him for missing so many votes - poor work ethic 
 Little Marco Rubio 
 Mitt Romney didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 21 
As I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow.pic.twitter.com/OIXFKPUlz2 
 Why would the people of Texas support Ted Cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them He is another all talk 

 Little Marco Rubio 
Making a big speech in Alabama today So many people we had to move to a football stadium Come and join us 
I am the only Republican who will get large numbers of Dems and Indies (crossover) I will also get states that no other Republican can get 
 While Hillary and I both won South Carolina by big margins 
 The Republican Establishment has been pushing for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio to say anything to   hit   Trump.I signed the pledge-careful  
 While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil) 

   @JimmyTheSaint09: @realDonaldTrump @RonnieMemo @ChrisChristie anything is better than @marcorubio    
   @fairess369: It is a sad commentary little boy Marco Rubio can't win in his home state Floridians despise him as a opportunist phony

 I started my business with very little and built it into a great company 
 I only wish my wonderful father 
Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people 
I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz 
 Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit After the audit 
I unfairly get audited by the I.R.S almost every single year I have rich friends who never get audited I wonder why 
   @NeilTurner_: @realDonaldTrump There's only one real candidate 
I will be on @foxandfriends at 8:30 A.M Will be talking about lightweight Marco Rubio and lying Ted Cruz

Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker  Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement They failed 
Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A.M Big crowd - get there early Big announcement to be made 
Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit 
 Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday Cruz is a nasty guy 
 I will be making a speech at 12:00 in Fort Worth 
   @WaltSeher: @realDonaldTrump @morg25016893 @eventbrite yup 200 Polish immigrants were hired by his contractor not Trump

   @donell27743094: @realDonaldTrump trump won the debate Disgusting Rubio said   peed   - is he still in junior high school    
   @tdltdltdltdl:  Marco Cruz and Ted Rubio (easy to get the two politicians confused) looked like desperate 
   @SkylerDeckard: @realDonaldTrump   that's because you've never hired anyone to do work before   favorite line from tonights debate    
   @restorereality: Tonight you proved to America you are the real deal You took fire from all sides

 Mitt Romney 

   @ChatteringTeef: @BornToBeGOP @realDonaldTrump @MittRomney hates to see Trump's success when he was so pathetic  
   @classyexplorer:  @ahernandez85a Romney is a pawn of the Establishment and has no individual thought process He is jealous of Trump    
   @conservativevin:  @ahernandez85a Romney should have been a tough guy with Obama He cowered and lost BADLY He's not relevant    
   @Stevekwebb: @realDonaldTrump Love it @tedcruz is done We need someone who is proven @realDonaldTrump will make America Great Again    

   @HosierN: @foxnewspolitics A vote for @tedcruz or @marcorubio is a vote for corruption 


 Texas

Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again The Evangelicals in S.C figured him out & said no 
 Ted Cruz does not have the right   temperment   to be President Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm BAD  
Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog Ted panicked 
Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration

 Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false 
Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks No wonder he has lost Evangelical support 
Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact Take ad down Ted Biggest liar in politics 
 Wow 
 It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve 

Many people are now saying I won South Carolina because of the last debate I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry

 South Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands Vote now (today) 
Remember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in Don't allow it

 Remember 
I’m self-funding and I am going to take care of the people – not the special interests and insurance companies like the other candidates

 JEB is a hypocrite Used massive private   Eminent Domain   --- Just another clueless politician!http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/02/08/governor-jeb-bush-has-a-much-more-serious-eminent-domain-problem-than-donald-trump/ …  
 Jeb used Eminent Domain & took advantage of a disabled vet in the process (2/2) 

 I'd like to call JEB a liar 
 Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!) 
 I will be in South Carolina all week Saturday is BIG 
 Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates 
 Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy 
 Ted Cruz 
 Wow 
Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests - the bosses 
 Loved the debate last night

 Lightweight @JebBush said tonight he didn't know his family used private eminent domain in Texas- Lie  



Ted Cruz is a cheater He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts 
Nasty Ted Cruz is at it again- same dirty tricks he used w/ @RealBenCarson- saying I may not be on ballot & I hold liberal positions LIES 
Wow Honored to be chosen by the highly respected   accurate Washington & Lee Mock Convention I hope you are right - I will make you proud

Love the people of South Carolina - look very much forward to the debate tonight

   @by @tedcruz good I want to see the court decide what I was always told   natural born   means - born on American soil    

 Last time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself If he doesn't do better this time 
 If @TedCruz doesn’t clean up his act 
Lightweight @JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC False advertising- desperate and sad 
 After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me 
 Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution

Jeb failed as Jeb He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq) Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance 
He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
 Remember 
 .@MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word I never said the word 
 Jeb Bush spent more than $40

 Thank you

 Now that Bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign

 Taking a helicopter to New Hampshire 


 This is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone 
 .@oreillyfactor @KarlRove- as per the show 

 Thank you @billoreilly & @KarlRove Ted Cruz should be immediately disqualified in Iowa 
Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me He would be so easy to beat 
 THANK YOU to everyone in Little Rock 




 Dr Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for   deceit and dirty tricks and lies    
 Cruz just lied again- I am 
The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud 

I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M Enjoy @FoxNews 
 Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus 
 And finally 
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz Fraud 
 Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud Also 
 During primetime of the Iowa Caucus 
 Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa 
Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany @cherijacobus begged us for a job We said no and she went hostile A real dummy @CNN 
 On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd  


 Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long 
   @stephbewitching @realDonaldTrump All you haters need to realize Trump got the second highest vote in history And he's never held office    
   @restorereality  Iowa is meaningless...keep pushing forward 
   @ellenEspence @realDonaldTrump Amazing job in Iowa Cruz just barely won    
   @93101Dianne @realDonaldTrump if you can do that well in Iowa then I see you acing it in all other significant states Momentum is growing    
   @LoreWestphal @realDonaldTrump You MUST win the Presidency in 2016     
 .@Morning_Joe @mikebarnicle on @realDonaldTrump: He finished 2nd but he made the turn successfully like a pro    
 I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign 
I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire Big crowd 
The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history 
 Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa 
My experience in Iowa was a great one I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place Nice 
It all begins today - WE WILL FINALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 






 It is time to take back our country- and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 

I will be interviewed on Face The Nation with @jdickerson this morning Enjoy

 The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters   in violation   They are now under investigation Bad

 .@FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night $6 
 Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse 
.@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S Senator How the hell did he ever get elected  @greta 
The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective Wants paid for pols

   @AmericanAsPie:  @glennbeck @SarahPalinUSA Remember when Glenn gave out gifts to ILLEGAL ALIENS at crossing the border Me too    


UNIFYING THE NATION 


 Wacko @glennbeck is a sad answer to the @SarahPalinUSA endorsement that Cruz so desperately wanted Glenn is a failing 
   @AnnCoulter: Trump destroyed Hillary & Sanders moved in But he didn't destroy her

   @ron_fournier: President Donald Trump (just getting used to it)   Wow 
 I am greatly honored to receive Sarah Palin's endorsement tonight

 “Palin’s brand among evangelicals is as gold as the faucets in Trump tower 
 Wow 

In the just released SC poll I increased my lead by 4 points since last poll by same firm Up by 14 Cruz dropped 3.http://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/the-buzz/article55176940.html … 
 Thank you for your strong testimony when welcoming me to Liberty University 

.@FreeJesseJames- Just read your complete statement You are an amazing guy & I really appreciate your words & support I will see you soon 
 On my way to Iowa- just received new national poll numbers Thank you 

Really disgusting that the failing New York Times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories 
 Dope Frank Bruni said I called many people 

 Wow 
.@TheBrodyFile great job on @AC360 Thank you for the very smart and kind words 

I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem Doubt 
Ted Cruz is falling in the polls He is nervous People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks 
 I loved being at Liberty University today Record setting crowd 





Thank you @IvankaTrump for the kind words I am very proud of the role model you are for so many NH & IA radio ad:https://youtu.be/bOGD9mvzIi4  
   @pbralick: @BenKissel great on @greggutfeld @GregGutfeldShow @JoNosuchinsky too    Thank you Ben for your nice comments on debate  
 I am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money 
 Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday Get tough and smart U.S 
 Big announcement in Ames 
 Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from U.S 
 In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners They get $150 billion 
Interesting read from Peggy Noonan.pic.twitter.com/jAxIy8xseM 
Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning?pic.twitter.com/rYGX9vazku 
 Wow Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions 

Greatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St 
When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him 
 Everybody that loves the people of New York 
 If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage 
 Ted is the ultimate hypocrite Says one thing for money 
 Great new numbers Thank you  


 Ted Cruz purposely 
 Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a   natural born Canadian 
 Oh no 
 The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace Remember 
 Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file Goldman Sachs owns him 
 Ted Cruz said he   didn't know   that he was a Canadian Citizen He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable  
Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow I told you so 
 More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends Strengthen the borders 
.@FrankLuntz is a total clown Has zero credibility  @FoxNews @megynkelly 
 .@oreillyfactor please explain to the very dumb and failing @glennbeck that I supported John McCain big league in 2008 
Just got back from Iowa - had a great time with amazing people Will be back soon 
.@GeraldoRivera  Thank you Geraldo for your nice words on @oreillyfactor tonight You are a true champion Thank @ericbolling - great guy 
   @GeraldoRivera @SenTedCruz got ass kicked by @realDonaldTrump last night-He offended every New Yorker & has no answer to Natural Born issue  

 Top searched candidate by state 
Sen Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush 
 Jeb Bush 


   @ameriflames: @realDonaldTrump @CLewandowski_ no one wants a Bush or a Clinton 
   @CLewandowski_: Massive crowd in Pensacola 

Do you think Iran would have acted so tough if they were Russian sailors Our country was humiliated 

   @melindaross123: @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump There isn't anything Donald Trump says that I don't agree with Go Trump    

United States looks more and more like a paper tiger Won't be that way if I win 
Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors Horrible pictures & images We are weak I will NOT forget 
 Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches Romney campaign 
 Why does @CNN & @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist

 So professional of @ABC news to throw out the failing @UnionLeader newspaper from their debate Paper won't survive 
Great job on Fox this morning @KatiePavlich I am sending out for your book immediately Thank you very much 

Why does @ThisWeekABC w/ @GStephanopoulos allow a hater & racist like @tavissmiley to waste good airtime @ABC can do much better than him 

 Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog For starters 
UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH 
This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed 
 If their highly unethical behavior 
I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate.http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/01/abc-severs-debate-partnership-with-union-leader-217560 … 
 Remember 
 Heading now for Reno

Will be on Meet the Press with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning Enjoy 
I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning Tune in 
I'm protesting the @UnionLeader from having anything to do w/ ABC debate Their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved

It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted 
 .@Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year 
 The failing @UnionLeader newspaper in N.H just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads How stupid 
 Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads Look at enclosed letter from them

 .@RuthMarcus of the @washingtonpost was terrible today on Face The Nation.No focus 
 .@chucktodd said today on @meetthepress that   attacking Bill to get to Hillary has never worked before   Wrong - attacked him in '08 & won  
 Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton 
 Thank you for your support in Biloxi 
Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm 
 Al-Shabbab 
Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T video The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate 
Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening 




Just arrived in Mississippi for the rally Word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive Will be an amazing evening 
 Heading to Biloxi 
 Remember 
 When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates 
I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women 
 Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president Jeb Bush is a low energy individual 
 Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL 
 .@JebBush is a low energy   stiff   who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls Has no chance  
 .@JebBush is a sad case A total embarrassment to both himself and his family 



 The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is 

I will be going to Mississippi tomorrow night - hear the crowds are going to be massive Look forward to it

.@jessebwatters is terrific at hosting on @FoxNews - he really gets it 
   @russgrand: @JebBush We had your brother and Father who were a disaster in office..do us a favor and drop out in favor of @realDonaldTrump

   @LeeMiracle3: @FoxNews @CharlesHurt @realDonaldTrump Trump listening to voters 

   @IJNIPGM: No casualties Just victory 
   @sunquist007: @JebBush Why do u keep trying to attack Trump Really dumb strategy U lose

 Strange 
 Wages in are country are too low 
 Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone 
 The middle-class has worked so hard 
 If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband 
   @BornToBeGOP: @realDonaldTrump We need a real President to get things done 
Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party FAST 
Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late Stupid  RNC 

   @isabellegirlxo: @realDonaldTrump @JebBush @ananavarro @secupp @CNN Ana is an illegal who needs to be deported    No 
 .@BernieSanders-who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime 
   @DavidSadler2525: @realDonaldTrump What's going on in VA What's the GOP doing  They will lose the state because of the RNC  
 Why are @JebBush flunkies  @ananavarro and @secupp 
The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory The Dems LOVE IT Be smart and win for a change 
R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row Will now not allow desperately needed new voters Suicidal mistake RNC MUST ACT NOW 
 It begins 
   @LegacyRealtorsJ: You will come out tops Mr Trump You are sincere 
   @JimVitari: @realDonaldTrump @CAC8438 we need the change Trump is going to make 
   @CAC8438: He supports amnesty and now they are so desperate that Trey Gowdy is going to campaign with him  
   @mitchellvii: My prediction on the Trey Gowdy endorsement of Rubio is that it will do nothing for Rubio and finish Gowdy    
   @mitchellvii: Face it 

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00 Will be talking about Hillary and far more interesting subjects Enjoy 
 I will do far more for women than Hillary 


 Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM 
   @greta: If the insurance companies are making lots of money and the # of uninsured is still large 
A new terror warning was issued for European cties At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart Weak leaders 


Criminal deportations in the U.S are the lowest number in many years We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country MUST CHANGE 
 The Phoenix V.A 
 The same people that said I wouldn't run 
.@chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings I will beat Hillary 

   @deedeegop: Thank u Mr Trump 
   @JodiL792:  You know what's making my Christmas Great 
   @Jacobsac2015:  @FoxNews Thank you for your tweet today on Christmas Can't wait to see you as President 

 When will the Democrats 
 Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A That will stop 
Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE He's spent $59 million and is at 3% 
 We have many problems in our house (country!) 
 Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now 
 .@deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews  She gets what is going on in politics 
 Merry Christmas to all Have a great day and have a really amazing year Together 
.@danielhalper  Great job on @CNN today Very wise indeed 
.@HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video Bad reporting Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it 
   @YesMrGilbert: @NBCNightlyNews @HallieJackson should have talked to Megyn Kelly about this story    True 
 I am now in Palm Beach 
 .@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39% 
Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll CNN even better 
 Wow 
 Next year will be an interesting one I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton 
Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias Think about Bill 
 Wow 
 In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me 
 Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign 
   @classyexplorer: @gatewaypundit Jim you fail to mention in your CNN POLL that in the GOP RACE...Trump is leading Cruz 39 to 18...Big Detail  


   @ihatematt: @realDonaldTrump why is Hillary even allowed to run She's a criminal    
   @ihatematt: @realDonaldTrump why is Hillary even allowed to run She's a criminal    Good question  
 Hillary said   I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign   I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity  
 Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays 


 Hillary 
It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories 21 pt Lead 
Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased Still thinks Romney won Unfair coverage of Trump 
.@FoxNews treats me so badly Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll All negative 
 The @washingtonpost 
 The silent majority- is silent no more Remember the importance of VOTING 

The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card 


Big news just out - NEW @CNN POLL  TRUMP  39 and leads in every major category Likeability way up CRUZ 18  CARSON 10  RUBIO 10 
 We need a PRESIDENT with strength 
It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong Sad 
 When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama 

 Wow 
 For those on TV defending my use of the word   schlonged 

 Once again 
 Jeb's big ad buy against me 
Watching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television Boring and biased 
 Women defy media narrative 

   @schoremis1:  @JebBush The Donald should've been named Man of the Year He dominates the polls 
   @qbeacademy: Well I'm at 42% and your at 3% .You know Jeb you started over here you keep on moving further and further off stage  Classic    
 .@JebBush's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around 
 Why doesn't @JebBush 
 Will @JebBush 
.@JebBush just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy Will never work 
 Weak and low energy @JebBush 
   @_MSFL_: @realDonaldTrump @TrumpUSA16 A GREAT PATRIOT    
   @realNevaDie: This suggests that online polls are more reliable so Trump is crushing both parties @realDonaldTrump

 THANK YOU America  

 Thank you - Michigan 

 Thank you - New Hampshire 


 THANK YOU Grand Rapids 
 @HerschelWalker 
Getting ready to leave for Michigan - will be an amazing evening See you there 
 Do you think that Hillary Clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about   the video   of me being used by ISIS There is no video  
Thanks @AndreaTantaros for all of your kind words and thoughts Big progress is being made Keep up the great work 
A suicide bomber has just killed U.S troops in Afghanistan When will our leaders get tough and smart We are being led to slaughter 

It's the Democrats' total weakness & incompetence that gave rise to ISIS --  not a tape of Donald Trump that was an admitted Hillary lie 

Getting ready to go to the great State of Michigan Big crowd tonight Make America Great Again 
 Just out: TRUMP GOP DEBATE - 18 
 Hillary said with respect to ISIS 
I demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate There never was a video 
 Hillary said at debate ISIS is   going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst   She made up story-want apology  
Very sad what happened last night at the Miss Universe Pageant I sold it 6 months ago for a record price This would never have happened 
   @msully65:  Tell this knitwit @SpeakerRyan 

 .@JebBush today said he didn't want to be the front-runner 
 Great poll out of Illinois Thank you 


 .@MissUniverse final 3 on now Great people 
 My friend 
It was really strange when Hillary was missing from the podium last night Not very presidential 
 Hillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me Therefore 
.@JebBush was terrible on Face The Nation today Being at 2% and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence A basket case 



 Hillary Clinton lied when she said that   ISIS is using video of Donald Trump as a recruiting tool   This was fact checked by @FoxNews: FALSE  



   @DomineekSmith: @realDonaldTrump is the best Republican presidential candidate of all time    Thank you  
   @Sharp_Trident:  @TheRealRyder Trump is looking like the next POTUS 
   @TheRealRyder: You are a blessing to America

   @TomSkeet: @realDonaldTrump @GStephanopoulos haha she's not ready for the Donald    
   @ofccadjust: @kellyz713 @tedb75 @TeresaC85469500 @MichaelCohen212  Right 
   @GStephanopoulos: As @realDonaldTrump dominates the latest polls 
.@GStephanopoulos stupidly believes that Hillary wants to run against me because she said so She says that so people believe it - opposite 


 Thank you Cedar Rapids 

 President Obama spends so much time speaking of the so-called Carbon footprint 
 See 



 Another new post-debate poll  


The last thing our country needs is another BUSH Dumb as a rock 
.@JebBush has embarrassed himself & his family with his incompetent campaign for President He should remain true to himself 


Weak & ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response False advertising 
I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster Try using your last name & don’t be ashamed of it 
.@MelindaDC  Don’t misrepresent in order to make a point I was always tough on ISIS--as you’ll find out after I get elected 
.@CharlesHurt  Thanks for defending me so brilliantly against @MelindaDC --  Always tough when they falsify 
 As I have been saying Only the beginning:   ISIS Suspects Arrested in Turkey 
 New Reuters poll - thank you

 Thank you for the nice words @ktmcfarland The debate was interesting 
 Will be interviewed on the @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 P.M Will be talking about the debate 
Bill O'Reilly calls Trump and  campaign brilliant In first place by 27 points

I wonder if @megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight No matter how well I do - bad 
.@megynkelly is very bad at math She was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and Cruz in the new Monmouth Poll 41to14 
 .@megynkelly 
Why isn't anyone using the @CNN Iowa Poll with me having a big lead They only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place).Dishonest press 
 Isn't it amazing that @CNN paid a fortune for an Iowa Poll 
 Wow 


   @piersmorgan: Donald Trump vs Hillary Clinton would be the greatest presidential battle in history    
   @LadyKellLiberty:  @AnnCoulter I'm in PA near PBurgh Dad will register to vote first time for Trump Mom is changing from D to R

 EXCLUSIVE: Newt Gingrich: ‘The Country Is in Rebellion 

Why doesn't @FoxNews quote the new Iowa @CNN Poll where I have a 33% to 20% lead over Ted Cruz and all others Think about it 

   @Barbara_NC:  Trump did not need 2acquire wealth & power 
People have got to stop working to be so politically correct and focus all of their energy on finding solutions to very complex problems 
   @ajodom60: @FoxNews and as far as that low-info voter base goes 
   @LesgartCPA: @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump Problem is I never watched you until Trump started giving you interviews and ratings on CNN    
   @trumpisawinner: .You're the real deal For my money 
   @JPMORGAN2016: TRUMP NEEDS HIS OWN POLL A REAL POLL 
   @1rdgreenberg:  @FoxNews That's why 
   @energy43: @schnoepoe @FoxNews Not so much fairness as it is about ratings  Megan Kellys hate nightly of Trump is turn-off for FOX    
 I was disappointed that Ted Cruz would speak behind my back 
 I did interview with Chris Wallace of @FoxNews in order to be fair He then puts on Rove 
   @TheProdigy3D: Everyone vote for @realDonaldTrump and no he did not pay me for this endorsement    
   @schnoepoe: @foxnews I find myself more and more drawn to CNN for fairness regarding @realDonaldTrump   The Fox News Sunday pundits a joke  
   @VYlvisaker: @AnnCoulter  TRUMP HAS STAMINA 
 Many think that the Championship Course at Turnberry 
A very good NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll was just released wherein I went up from last month and am in the lead Nice 
   @BernieSanders: ABC News spent 81 minutes on Donald Trump and only 20 seconds on our campaign  That's because @ABC is smart  
 .@danawhite  Great job last night - very exciting You have come a long way from those difficult early days 
 People that have read it tell me that @KarlRove book is terrible (and boring) Save your money @FoxNews should can him 

   @Yoel_NY: @realDonaldTrump @Peggynoonannyc  As a democrat I have to say 
   @JPMORGAN2016: @realDonaldTrump @Peggynoonannyc TRUMP IS WINNING BY SO MUCH MORE 
   @rosemarylowe105: @ShahKourosh @SpacemanChris @realDonaldTrump That is why we don't need a politician to be the next president    
   @StraightHand: @realDonaldTrump I'd pay to watch that - The Donald vs Hillary    Get ready  

   @mikepetrella17:  @Peggynoonannyc I agree with Trump Record turnouts  There's a lot of potential voters that Trump is tapping into  
Chris Wallace @fox at 10:00 A.M 


.@CNN @jaketapper at 9:00 A.M 
.@Peggynoonannyc An election between Hillary and myself will be the biggest voter turnout in U.S history Just like the debates 24 M vs 2M 
 .@Peggynoonannyc Interesting article 
   @Michael2014abc: @Alwaleed_Talal @realDonaldTrump Has your country 
 Something must be done with dopey @KarlRove - he is pushing Republicans down the same old path of defeat Don't fall for it 


   @Latinos4Trump16: @realDonaldTrump @jaketapper @CNN I'll be watching     
   @ofccadjust: @realDonaldTrump @jaketapper @CNN DVR SET    
I will be interviewed on @jaketapper @CNN at 9:00 A.M and Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace at 10:O0  A.M CNN Iowa Poll -13 point lead

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00 A.M So much to talk about

   @JenniferJJacobs: Trump:   Protect the 2nd amendment...And by the way we’re going to be saying Merry Christmas again   Iowa crowd LOVES it    
   @JenniferJJacobs: Iowa's RNC committeewoman Tamara Scott praises Trump and asks why the RNC would not be thrilled with his candidacy  
   @JenniferJJacobs: Trump says he was establishment   I backed McCain he lost I backed Romney he lost This time I'm doing it myself  
   @Keeblerqueen: @realDonaldTrump Good Lord  Donald Your following went up so much lately  Crazy love for you and what you stand for  


 Just got back from Iowa 
 I had a great time in Des Moines 
.@MonicaCrowley you were great with @SeanHannity on @FoxNews tonight  Thank you for your kind words We will keep Americans safe 



 I will not let you down  


Tom Ridge is a failed 'Bushy' & PA Governor Him & his friend @KarlRove shouldn't be allowed to do their bias commentary- nobody listens 
Tom Ridge should be focused on trying to bring the party together rather than ripping it apart w/ your faulty thought process I will win 



 .@chucktodd is a nice guy  
 .@Morning_Joe just went off the rails I will beat Hillary easily - she does not want to run against me I am tuning them out 
 .@tedcruz should not make statements behind closed doors to his bosses 
 Looks like @tedcruz is getting ready to attack I am leading by so much he must I hope so 
 .@Morning_Joe is so off on Iowa 
 Great evening last night in  New Hampshire Got the endorsement from the New England Police Union - big  territory 
.@BernardGoldberg was not good tonight on @oreillyfactor He just doesn't know about winning But he is a nice guy 

   @FoxNews: @FrankLuntz: Time for the Republican establishment to accept the fact that Trump is not only a viable candidate 
   @edwards_cristy: @realDonaldTrump I hope that you will be the next POTUS    
Respected Morning Consult poll just out I lead all Republicans and beat Hillary head to head by a wide margin- 45 to 40 
 In Britain 
 Thank you to @Franklin_Graham I have always appreciated your courage 


Establishment flunky @KarlRove is going crazy with the just released CBS poll that has me way ahead New Fox poll has me beating Hillary 
Dummy @KarlRove continues to make and write false statements He still thinks Romney won--he should get a life 




 The United Kingdom is trying hard to disguise their massive  Muslim problem Everybody is wise to what is happening 
I have decided to postpone my trip to Israel and to schedule my meeting with @Netanyahu at a later date after I become President of the U.S

   @jimparkey: @realDonaldTrump @donlemon @CNN great interview Speaking calmly but carrying a heavy stick   Thank you  
Weak and totally conflicted people like @TheRickWilson shouldn't be allowed on television unless given an I.Q test Dumb as a rock  @CNN 
   @QuinnLisaq:  @CNN @donlemon  The people do not care what politician said about Trump  We still support him all the way    
Great interview tonight @donlemon - very professionally done @CNN 


   @Ajdx4Sdesq: @CNN @donlemon @realDonaldTrump this is the best interview so far Honest 
   @michaelUrso2: Mr Trump did you deny Megyn Kelly What is her issue I used to like her Can't stand her now Very little talent @FoxNews  
Thank you @oreillyfactor for your wonderful editorial as to why I should have been @TIME Magazine's Person of the Year You should run Time

   @mysteriousLoser: @realDonaldTrump did you hear the mayor nutter of philadelphias comments towards you Ignorance   Yes 

   @ray_aub:  @nytimes @CNN People forget the policies of leaders like @JebBush allowed 9/11 killers to immigrate 
Hillary Clinton does not have the STRENGTH or STAMINA to be President We need strong and super smart for our next leader - or trouble 
The last person corrupt Hillary Clinton wants to run against is Donald J Trump I'll end up beating her in every state New Fox Poll-Trump 
 The failing @nytimes does not mention the new @CNN Poll that has me leading Iowa by a massive 13 points - I am at 33% Maggie Haberman 
   @USAforDJTRUMP: @realDonaldTrump @CNN Mr Trump

I am especially grateful for the tremendous support I have received from the Evangelicals in the just out Iowa CNN poll Thank you 
 I am greatly honored by the results of the CNN poll in Iowa In the end 
.@washingtonpost is going out of its way to tell failing candidates how to beat Donald Trump.The Post doesn’t get that I’m good at winning 
   @BornToBeGOP @DanScavino  Trump will only increase his lead after the terror attacks America believes Trump will get rid of ISIS    





 If @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes 
The @washingtonpost loses   money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon Big tax shelter 
 The @washingtonpost 
 N.Y.C has the worst Mayor in the United States I hate watching what is happening with the dirty streets 
 I spoke with other candidates to a Jewish group 
 Obama said in his speech that Muslims are our sports heroes What sport is he talking about 
Thank you Graham Ledger of the Daily Ledger @OANN for your really fair coverage and your great interview with Peter Roff of U.S NEWS & W.R 

   @WiggintonRandy: @realDonaldTrump He will never say it 
 Well 
Should have gone after the oil years ago (like I have been saying) 
 Wish Obama would say ISIS 
Is that all there is We need a new President - FAST 
   @homefreeee: @realDonaldTrump He needs to stop all Visas not look at them    
   @JFK4701: @realDonaldTrump he is reading off the TelePrompTer    But that is O.K in this case  

   @10inchpolitics: @realDonaldTrump air strikes Who's air strikes    
   @dboiarsky: @realDonaldTrump MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

 So 
Watch Face The Nation - will be on now 
 Hillary just said that she will not use the term   radical Islamic   - but was incapable of saying why She is afraid of  Obama & the e-mails  

   @JSears68: Poll numbers will go up even more for @realDonaldTrump after Obama's 'address'  
   @dr_tweedy: @CNN @JohnKasich Kasick message is as muddled and stagnant as his political career Lied about Trump crowd   Media-he LIED  
I will be interviewed on Face The Nation @CBSNews at 10:30 A.M Should be interesting - ENJOY 
Was going to do a phoner this morning with @jaketapper on @CNN but they could not get their phone equipment to hook in Will do next week

   @reallyo1: @realDonaldTrump @MarkSimoneNY Don't let the jackals in the media trip u up Their getting desperate    
   @MargaretCrowth1: @realDonaldTrump So like the media to make something out of nothing Don't let them sidetrack from the message    
   @DeusVultGeorgia: @MingBlueTeaCup @RickCanton @_Holly_Renee @realDonaldTrump should the reporter's dishonesty be shielded from ridicule    
   @VaughnVhalen: Donald Trump Rises to 38% Nationally; Ted Cruz Edges into 2nd at 12%

 The failing @nytimes should focus on fair and balanced reporting rather than constant hit jobs on me Yesterday 3 boring articles 
 I do not know the reporter for the @nytimes 

   @PrisonPlanet: .@realDonaldTrump gets it Never apologize for fake controversies whipped up by the perpetually offended  media    

Happy Thanksgiving to all Have a great day and look forward to the future We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
 The numbers at the @nytimes  are so dismal 
 So 
The dopes at the @nytimes bought the Boston Globe for $1.3 billion and sold it for $1.00 Their great old headquarters-gave it away So dumb 
The @nytimes is so poorly run and managed that other family members are looking to take over control With unfunded liabilities-big trouble 
   @RioSunny3: @realDonaldTrump @WKRG I lived in New Jersey at that time and witnessed all that as well  
The failing @nytimes should be focused on good reporting and the papers financial survival and not with constant hits on Donald Trump 
   @Keeping__Real: So good to see the @realDonaldTrump family out with him on the campaign trail It really shows the family man that he is

 John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed 
 Once John Kasich announced he was running for president 
 John Kasich fell right into President Obama’s trap on ObamaCare 
Doesn’t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else  - he’s almost last 
 John Kasich ad guy wanted to work for me 
 I loved beating John Kasich in the debates 
Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down People from NH are smart 
Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun 
 I want to do negative ads on John Kasich 
 John Kasich 
 John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image 
 Governor Kasich

 When and how are the dummies at the @WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me I want   smart   trade deals  
 The @WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong 
.@WSJ Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and T.P.P and apologize China not part but will get their way in later

.@AJDelgado13 Thank you so much for the nice words and support--really enjoy listening to your ideas and thoughts 
I think it would be a good idea—and fair—to include @GovChristie & @MikeHuckabeeGOP in the debate Both solid & good guys @FoxBusiness 
 Carson now admits his friend named   Bob 
 With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer 

Florida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio So do two people who worked with him Said he used the wrong credit card Sure 
   @rhinostate: .@realDonaldTrump @GrundleMan27 Rubio is a Manchurian Candidate People will own him if he ever became president    



   @Rick_Sa: @greta Interesting presidential race; Carson tries to beat his mom with a hammer 
   @DeeMcNa: @FoxNews Silent majority did not try to kill their mothers 
A great honor to easily finish FIRST in the @FoxNews poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner 

   @keksec_org: @realDonaldTrump Ivanka said it and you said it too 

   @SandraJenners: I love to see the respect you have shown to your parents 
 The Carson story is either a total fabrication or 

 Rubio lied about my meeting w/ Hispanic activists I didn’t change my opinion but treated them w/ respect Shame  

   @marklindsay78: @Hanan_Khan2 @realDonaldTrump poll numbers are higher then most think

 .@seanhannity should have corrected Jeb Bush when he said that I   ran for president twice   Never ran 

   @lizzym420: @amrightnow @realDonaldTrump What other candidate begins to rival Trump in his knowledge 
   @Destiny: Why didn't @seanhannity correct Jeb when he said @realDonaldTrump has run 4 president 2X B4~Jeb needs 2B corrected b/c he lied    
   @spiritofshiloh: Carson has the WORST health plan EVER re: Soc Sec and Medicare @realDonaldTrump  He wants to abolish Medicare - no way  
 Jeb Bush just said about Marco Rubio 
 Also 


Just landed in New Hampshire - a very exciting morning planned

   @HenryTheZebra: @realDonaldTrump America needs you to start your 8-year shift a bit early to start fixing this disaster    


 Now that Iran ripped us off by making one of the best deals of any kind in history 
   @BornToBeGOP: @realDonaldTrump 9 years from now we will thank President Trump for making us great again   Thank you  
 I will be on Sirius XM RADIO 
 Thank you @JoeTrippi for the nice 
 While in politics it is often smart to send out false messages 

If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered 
 Marco Rubio will not win Weak on illegal immigration 
I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor 
 Jeb's new slogan -   Jeb can fix it   I never thought of Jeb as a crook Stupid message 

 Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's 
   @BellicWolf: @and_is_w Anyway

   @KatyTurNBC: This is the most focused Trump stump I've heard - really drilling down on vets issues here in Virginia    
 .@thehill  John Oliver had his people call to ask me to be on his very boring and low rated show I said   NO THANKS   Waste of time & energy  
Few people know that  @FortuneMagazine is still in business Tell your writer  Alisa Soloman that I left The Apprentice to run for president 

   @BorderWall: Floridian here I quit watching debates years ago & most TV except GATOR football until you decided to run for President    
   @sean_in_NH: @realDonaldTrump @realOllieTaylor so true In all previous debates 


   @JodiL792: @realDonaldTrump I wouldn't be watching at all Honestly    
   @antSTACKSgrieco: @realDonaldTrump you were great in it   Thanks  
   @realOllieTaylor: @realDonaldTrump no one would have watched the debates if Trump had not  been in them

 Black Lives Matter protesters totally disrupt Hillary Clinton event She looked lost This is not what we need with ISIS

   @mozarttaig1: @CNBC is trying to drive down poll numbers to install Carson - who the Establishment GOP will promptly roll Win Don Win    
Does anybody think that @CNBC will get their fictitious  polling numbers corrected sometime prior to the start of the debate Sad 
   @1Barbara1: @realDonaldTrump @Morning_Joe @politico I watched the entire rally and Trump was very well received the place was packed    
.@Morning_Joe can you believe Kasie Hunt's poor and purposely inaccurate reporting on my great night and crowd in Iowa @politico is a scam

   @coloradojoe2001: How is any one taking Carson seriously when he   suspends   his presidential campaign for a book signing tour    
 Dopey @BillKristol 

All Presidential candidates should immediately disavow their Super PAC’s They're not only breaking the spirit of the law but the law itself 
Re Super PAC scam:  What the other candidates are doing is a disgrace 
This whole Super PAC scam is very unfair to a person like me who has disavowed all PAC's & is self-funding 

   @hoosierclinger: Good job @realDonaldTrump for badgering Ford Why didnt POTUS or Hillary care about those UAW jobs in Ohio

 Does everyone remember   @MittRomney and his famous remarks about   self-deportation   and   47%   He was done I don't need his angry advice  
.@MittRomney and his campaign manager should not be critical of candidates after they blew an election that should never have been lost 
 .@MittRomney  can only speak negatively about my presidential chances because I have been openly hard on his terrible   choke   loss to Obama  

.@FoxNewsSunday 
 Jeb 
This morning Chris Wallace has the best political show on television - but that's only because I'm on it (kidding) Have fun 
 Jeb Bush should stop trying to defend his brother and focus on his own shortcomings and how to fix them Also 
On at 9:00A.M or 10:00 A.M (depending on your location)  on Fox is a tough but really good interview with Chris Wallace Enjoy

Lightweight Senator @RandPaul should focus on trying to get elected in Kentucky--- a great state which is embarrassed by him

 Man did JEB throw his brother under the bus last night on @colbertlateshow  Probably true 

A letter to @CNN President Jeff Zucker-pic.twitter.com/HKUYv9tFRm

Jeb’s policies in Florida helped lead to its almost total collapse Right after he left he went to work for Lehman Brothers—wow 
 The lobbyists & special interests have just put out an ad for Jeb which hits me   just a little   but is very false  
I’m self funding my campaign but lobbyists & special interests for Jeb & others are starting to do big ads—desperate Don’t believe them 

 Thank you @IngrahamAngle for your strength & wonderful words last night on @FoxNews 
 Wow Such nice words from Robert Redford on my running for President Thank you 
Tomorrow in DC: 1 PM West Front Lawn of the Capitol Not even believable that we would do this deal with Iran 
Look forward to being in DC tomorrow—big crowd expected for our protest against the truly stupid nuclear deal we are making with Iran 
Looking forward to being with @SenTedCruz at our big rally in D.C on Wednesday (1:00 P.M at the Capitol) to protest insane Iran nuke deal 
Both Washington D.C and DALLAS are turning out to be really big events D.C is protest of incompetent Iran deal and Dallas is big speech 
 Remember 
   @Douglasmaher: @realDonaldTrump @TIMENOUT @surveyusa Looking forward to seeing you in Dallas and voting for you   Great  
   @georgeokc: @realDonaldTrump @libertyladyusa For my mind

   @DeanAllen12: @club4growth  Club4Growth will do anything for a handout just like every other POLITICIAN running Pay to Say organization    


   @cadigirl13: @realdonaldtrump You are our only hope  Keep strong Mr.Trump   Thank you

   @jasonusmc2017: @blayne_troy @realDonaldTrump: He was right when he called Obama the 5 for 1 president 5 terrorist for one no good traitor  

   @SamSteel10: @shook_stephanie @slone as long as we can stay strong and give @realDonaldTrump our support He's the leader    
 I will be in Washington D.C on Wednesday 
The Dallas event on September 14 at 6:00 P.M at the American Airlines Center looks like it will be a giant success Tickets are going FAST 
 Our country needs a president with great leadership skills and vision 
 The phony Club For Growth 

   @ryanamberwhite: Check it out 


 If the presidential election were held today 
The hedge fund guys (gals) have to pay higher taxes ASAP They are paying practically nothing We must reduce taxes for the middle class 
 By self-funding my campaign 
 Remember that I am self-funding my campaign Hillary 
 Hillary said such nasty things about me 
 Hillary Clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter I have ever seen In fact 
 Saudi Arabia was   vehemently   against the Iran nuclear deal Then today they embraced it What happened What did we give them to endorse  
 Wow 
 Just announced that because of   Trump   
 Why would a very low ratings radio talk show host like Hugh Hewitt be doing the next debate on @CNN He is just a 3rd rate   gotcha   guy  
 Very low ratings radio host Hugh Hewitt asked me about Suleiman 
 The Dallas event in two weeks 
 .@MeghanMcCain was terrible on @TheFive yesterday Angry and obnoxious 

 So nice 
 Daily Caller: Trump Surpasses Field

 .@brithume 


 .@kevinolearytv Great job on @foxandfriends this morning You tell it like it is Also 


Will be interviewed on @GMA this morning at 7:00 Thanks for the GREAT poll results 


   @LBabcock2:  @oreillyfactor @FoxNews I have always wondered why Fox kept Rove on after his disastrous election predictions   He is a joke  
   @gulfportedd: @realDonaldTrump Jeb bush couldn't shine MR trumps shoes...give me a break Bushes are so over    

 When I intelligently turned down The Club For Growth crazy request for $1 
 The president of the pathetic Club For Growth came to my office in N.Y.C and asked for a ridiculous $1 


 Every Poll has me winning BIG.If you listen to dopey Karl Rove 
Why does @oreillyfactor and @FoxNews always have Karl Rove on He spent $430 million and lost ALL races A dope who said Romney won election 
 I’m turning down millions of dollars of campaign contributions—feel totally stupid doing so 
 Many Super Pacs 

Congrats everyone--we topped 4 million today on Twitter--and heading up fast 
 While millions are being spent against me in attack ads 
Jeb is spending millions of dollars on “hit” ads funded by lobbyists & special interests Bad system 
Yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign Will Jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me 
   @BelAirCA: Only Trump is capable of cleaning up the mess America is in 
The just released Public Policy Polling (PPP - national result) is the best yet MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
   @highwayhopper66: @ConnieMackIV @00patriot My wife and I are both voting for trump in florida over our previous governor PERIOD   Thank you  

Just out - new PPP NATIONAL POLL has me in first place by a wide margin at 29% I wonder why only @FoxNews has not reported this Too bad 
150 Clinton E-mails still contain classified information More sensitive when she was Sec.of State This is a very big deal 
President Obama wants to change the name of Mt McKinley to Denali after more than 100 years Great insult to Ohio I will change back

   @ASA_Patriot: @realDonaldTrump @PatrickStinard @megynkelly I could not agree more  I now flip to other channels at 9:00pm    
   @RageFelix:  @GovernorPataki  I LIVED IN NY WHEN   TACKY PATAKI   WAS GOV HE WAS A TOTAL DISASTER FOR THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK  
   @Dlund22226523: Gov Scott Walker has ran Wisconsin's economy into the ground How dare he criticize you You would fire him in a second    
   @ibemoshing: No hope for Jeb Bush anymore 
 .@GovernorPataki did a terrible job as Governor of New York If he ran again 
 Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a   fence   It's not a fence 
Asians are very offended that JEB said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics A mess 
 In a clumsy move to get out of his   anchor babies   dilemma 
 Jeb Bush never uses his last name on advertising 
   @PatrickStinard: @megynkelly Kelly File was much better without Megyn Kelly Her replacement while she was out on vacation was much better

   @ColeHudson68: @megynkelly @FoxNews @theBlaze @greta @OreillyFactor Megyn needs to go back on vacation What a waste of an hour on Fox

   @ZephyrusMatrix: Will you finally get respect for predicting U.S concerns even weeks before disaster strikes.The country needs a visionary  
Markets are crashing - all caused by poor planning and allowing China and Asia to dictate the agenda This could get very messy Vote Trump 
   @john_franco: When people start losing their savings & home value 
 As I have long stated 
 New Reuters Poll just came out and has me at 32% 
 The last thing we need is another Bush in the White House Would be the same old thing (remember   read my lips 
Jeb Bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body Jeb just can't get it right 
 Jeb Bush is weak on illegal immigration 
 Now that I started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border 
 It has just been confirmed by  the City of Mobile 
How is Bernie Sanders going to defend our country if he can't even defend his own microphone Very sad 
Thank you to the @washingtonpost for the accurate and very discriptive  story on my speech in Alabama last night It was a great evening

 We are going to make our country so strong again 
   @2ndVoter: @SteveHuang68 agree One of the things that is good abt @realDonaldTrump is he's forcing others out of status quo politicking    
   @MattyJack33:  @TomLlamasABC So refreshing to have someone call out these left wingers posing as journalists Keep it up Trump    
.@WNTonight please correct your story tonight The public is fed-up with bad reporting for the sake of sensationalizing something

The Veterans Administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly John McCain has done nothing to help them but talk 
 John McCain called thousands of people   crazies   when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in Phoenix He owes apology  
   @mwood_79:  @SharylAttkisson Why do they attack Mr Trump Because he has something they dont The ability of truth Trump is here

   @deannecox777:  @SharylAttkisson Because she shoots straight like you do 
 Wow 
One of the reasons I am no fan of John McCain is that our Vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians I will fix VA quickly 

 Why would anybody listen to @MittRomney He lost an election that should have easily been won against Obama By the way 
 Congrats to the new Gov of Texas 
I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans Veterans deserve universal access to care VA scandal proves politicians are inept 
....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care 
It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans 
I will make this right for our great Vets 
 All he does is go on television is talk 
....John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives 
The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years 
 Captured or not 
 In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets

Dummy @Clare_OC @Forbes: Tiny fragrance deal with Parlux means nothing Still sold at Trump Tower 
 Dummy @Clare_OC from failing @Forbes magazine: NASCAR deal was 1 nite ballroom 
Dummy writer @Clare_OC from failing @Forbes magazine works so hard to make such trivial license deals look important…

 The Mayor of Baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters   space to destroy   - another real genius  
 Now that the ineffective Baltimore  Police have allowed the city to be destroyed 
Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore 
Blatant and rampant property destruction in Baltimore as the police stand by and watch Should be a lesson on how NOT to handle riots SAD

 The reason Ed Schultz said nice things about me is that I’m the only Repub who won't cut Social Security 
 I’m a conservative 
 With a stupid guy like Jonah Goldberg who uses “tweeting like a 14 year old girl” to hit me 
People have been forced to resign positions for far less than @JonahNRO’s “tweeting like a 14 year old girl” 
.@JonahNRO You stated that I started “relentlessly tweeting like a 14-year-old girl...”  Horrible insult to women Resign now or later

 Whether you think you can or think you can't 
 Now that Mitt is gone 
 When I broadly proclaimed Mitt “choked” – and would do it again—everybody said yeah 
I will take full credit for Mitt Romney dropping out of the race—looks like he won’t be endorsing Trump any time soon 

Mitt did the right thing—not because he had to-- but because he never would have been given a second chance after his first fiasco 
Everyone is saying the bad news is that Donald Trump is going to take credit & they are right—Mitt wouldn’t have won anyway

“The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.” – Walt Disney 
Romney was the architect of ObamaCare Bush’s Chief Justice legalized the monstrosity Notice a trend 

A Clinton already defeated a Bush The definition of insanity is doing the same thing twice & expecting a different result 
If only Obama would treat @IsraeliPM @netanyahu with the same respect he awards tyrants Very strange & dangerous for our national security 
Obama now wants to deny due process to the police He’ll give all constitutional rights to the terrorists but not our cops

   @WartenbergHans @JoshuaBlack2014 One of the many things I admire about you Mr Trump is that you aren't afraid to speak your mind   True  

Not so smart after all … Man with name on Duke law library must pay me legal fees after Trump trial victory 
Should have settled … Ft Lauderdale plaintiffs must pay me close to $400k in legal fees after Trump trial victory 
Pigs get slaughtered … again  Ft Lauderdale plaintiffs must pay me close to $400k in legal fees after Trump trial victory

Obama is community organizing from the Oval Office on Ferguson today More riots sure to follow

President Obama has absolutely no control (or respect) over the African American community-they have fared so poorly under his presidency 
 If you love it 
Who is the moron who decided to release the Ferguson grand jury findings after 9:00 o'clock in the evening What were they thinking 
 Our country is totally fractured and 
 Sadly 
 As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U.S economically 
Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the U.S as they watch the Ferguson riot 
 If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite 
 Despite having a black president 
   @TheRealZach49: This is why we need @realDonaldTrump in office @BarackObama doesn't know how to keep order    
   @Abdul_Akbarzai1:    @TheRealZach49: @realDonaldTrump can't wait for you to take over this country and rebuild what Obama destroyed    
   @D_Mellette: @realDonaldTrump for president 2k16    
Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots Not smart 
Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators 
ISIS is starting its own currency May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented 
There is no excuse for riots in Ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome 
Fact – Amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness Obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform

Obama’s China ‘climate’ deal binds America with language of ‘will’ curb emissions now while China only ‘intends’ to curb in 2030 Bad deal

Can you believe that the U.S will be sending 3000 troops to Africa to help with Ebola.They will come home infected We have enough problems 
 It is so sad to see what has happened to Atlantic City So many bad decisions by the pols over the years - airport

Tell Saudi Arabia and others that we want (demand!) free oil for the next ten years or we will not protect their private Boeing 747s.Pay up 
Middle Eastern countries must participate militarily (no running away) and big league financially in order for us to go in and save them

If anybody else but Coore and Crenshaw designed Pinehurst they would be run out of town—(and the turtleback greens are totally unfair) 
The only reason I am critical of the Pinehurst look is because I’m a lover of golf—and that look on TV hurts golf badly

   @ichicagoscott: @realDonaldTrump it was nice of you to give @MattGinellaGC 15 minutes of fame that he wouldn't have had    I agree  
   @welsh @realDonaldTrump you have made some great courses

   @aec4444: @realDonaldTrump please don't let the USGA ruin your course in 2017 like they did Pinehurst    I won't  
   @Robert_W_GA: @realDonaldTrump they think the course should be   old school   
I'd bet the horrible look of Pinehurst translates into poor television ratings This is not what golf is about

I have been very consistent and always said that Iraq would fall as soon as the U.S left What a terrible waste of lives and money 
 Iran will convince our incompetent President that they are trying to help us with Iraq 
Turnberry in Scotland is a far superior golf course to Pinehurst - and it isn't even close Likewise the Blue Monster at Doral 
 Iran is moving troops into Iraq under the guise that it is helping out Actually

The five Taliban leaders released for a deserter must really be laughing and having a good time right now They are saying how dumb U.S is 
Our President is a great embarrassment to the U.S How could anybody be so dumb or know so little as to make the very stupid 5 for 1 swap

 Just to show you how dishonest certain reporters are 
Dopey @ariannahuff should force her reporters to be accurate—if she has that power 
It’s important to listen to what people say “Horrible” and “disgusting” are the words I used in response to Sterling’s comments 
It is also amazing how comments can be edited to provide statements that are used in a knowingly incorrect manner

 Some great quotes from the legendary and courageous Winston Churchill:   Never 
 If you’ve looked over the years 
 By Obama mentioning Manhattan yesterday in his response 
   @wesbart53: Watched his speech yesterday...pathetic Carter-esque 
This is the time for the United States to be strengthening all important military components - not rolling over and dealing from weakness 
 Not good or smart for Obama to be calling Russia a   regional   power or to mention the concept of a nuclear weapon going off in NYC  
 President Obama looks absolutely exhausted in the Netherlands He is not a natural leader 
   He that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else   --

 Unsustainable With our $17T debt & $90T in unfunded liabilities 

 When @crowleyCNN defended Obama on Benghazi in the presidential debate 

 No better place to celebrate New Year’s Eve than @TrumpSoHo 
Prime Minister @David_Cameron is very foolish in giving @AlexSalmond so much money to build wind turbines which r destroying Scotland 
 Under President Obama 
Who thinks that President Obama is totally incompetent

 They call it   climate change   now because the words   global warming   didn't work anymore Same people fighting hard to keep it all going

I really like Nelson Mandela but South Africa is a crime ridden mess that is just waiting to explode-not a good situation for the people 
 “Is business success a natural talent I think it’s a combination of aptitude 
The evidence continues to mount against lightweight @AGSchneiderman  It is time for JCOPE and Moreland Commissions to act 



The ill-conceived windfarm that @AlexSalmond is pushing for Aberdeen will lose $50 million a year Only a fool would build it or want it 
If Graydon Carter's very dumb bosses would fire him for his terrible circulation numbers at failing Vanity Fair-his bad food restaurants die 
Bird killing windfarm that I oppose in Aberdeen got delayed by at least two years.@AlexSalmond forced the failing developers to delay 

Sources inside @AGSchneiderman’s office are saying that they are very concerned with the allegations against their lightweight boss 
My complaint against @AGSchneiderman is a “case study” for JCOPE & Moreland Commissions on everything that is wrong with NYS politics 
 Economics behind ugly 
Can you believe that the corrupt and pathetic South Africa police force has yet to arrest the sign language guy Such danger-give 10 years 
What a sad thing that the  memory of Nelson Mandela will be stained by the phoney sign language moron who is in every picture at funeral

I truly believe that our country has the worst and dumbest negotiators of virtually any country in the world 
 Can you believe that   President   Karzai of Afghanistan is holding out for more 
 Despite the fact that I have had great success with the words YOU'RE FIRED 
 Why doesn't President Obama simply apologize for telling a big fat lie 
US froze $8B in Iranian assets during ’79 Hostage Crisis Now Obama is giving it back to Iran while Christian Pastor is jailed Don't do it 
Happy Thanksgiving to all--even the haters and losers 
 Tell Iran to let our Christian Pastor go--and I mean right now If they don't 
Make sure to enjoy your time with your family during the holiday It is a special time Love and appreciate your family

 President Obama is finally getting hammered 
 New poll 
 Don't worry 
 Just got home 
“The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it.” – The Art of The Deal 
 Why didn't Obama 
Obama is going to take away over 90M Americans’ healthcare plans but he is letting Iran keep its nukes Just think about that 
Who would  you rather have negotiating with Iran--President Obama or Toronto Mayor Ford My money is on Ford 
Realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort You're in charge Everything starts with you 
 Don't underestimate yourself or your possibilities--keep your focus intact 
 After settling for a ridicilous 13 billion dollars 
 Best book ever on dealmaking (or so they say) - TRUMP: THE ART OF THE DEAL  Go get it 
 I know it has been many years since our country made great deals 
 The reason great dealmakers do not OPENLY celebrate a deal 
 John Kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with Iran Great dealmakers do not celebrate deals 
 Tom Brady is a good friend of mine 
Tom Brady has done a great job tonight-amazing New England comeback Good game- not over yet 
We had all the leverage in our nuclear negotiations with Iran and our leaders foolishly decided to let them out of the trap WHY 
 How much longer are we expected to put up with the world's most incompetent     leader - ObamaCare 
 I will be on Fox & Friends tomorrow morning at 7 Will be discussing basic stupidity and incompetence 

I do not understand how so many of my Jewish friends backed Obama in the last election He is a TOTAL DISASTER FOR ISRAEL-AND ALWAYS WILL BE 
How far has the United States gone down when we are reduced to accept the imbecilic deal just agreed to with Iran Read THE ART OF THE DEAL 
 What a rotten deal we made with Iran We get nothing (except laughter at our stupidity) They get everything 
They changed the name global warming to climate change because the concept of global warming just wasn't working 
The people that gave you global warming are the same people that gave you ObamaCare 
   @mikehaas33: @realDonaldTrump mar a lago a spectacular property Here with Wells Fargo tonight and hoping you will come say hello    I did  
 Snow and ice 
Get smart on knockout assaults and crime - we have to be slightly more vicious (and violent) than the assaulter-and crime would end FAST 
The scum that gets high on badly hurting old ladies and others through knockout assaults wouldn't feel that way with a gun at their head 
We are using the absolute wrong negotiating technique with respect to the Iran nuclear talks Strengthen sanctions until GREAT deal is made

 Such a nice article in the New York Times about a wonderful developer 
Thomas Jefferson wrote the Senate filibuster rule Harry Reid & Obama killed it yesterday  Rule was in effect for over 200 years

 For all those sick degenerates contemplating a knockout attack 
 Weak newscasters are asking   is there a racial component to knockout attacks   Of course there is and weakness will only make it worse  
 If you are lucky enough to catch a knockout assaulter before getting slugged 
Knockout assaults are the new rage by sick and depraved youth We better start getting tough in this country-and they want to take our guns

 No matter how far down a path you go 
ObamaCare is on LIFE SUPPORT - it will soon be DEAD ON ARRIVAL - A bad concept that was imcompetently administered 
President Obama is under pressure from Democrats to undo his lie on ObamaCare His problem is that such a move would end ObamaCare

I just don't know why some of these NFL teams with lousy quarterbacks don't give Tim Tebow a chance - what do they have to lose

 Wow 
No surprise Saudis turned down spot on UN Security Council They don’t want  responsibility Just have us do their heavy lifting

 If you don’t treat yourself like royalty 
Obama has called @GOP terrorists during this showdown It’s a shame he really doesn’t think it because then he would meet all @GOP demands 

   The fact that we are here today to debate raising America’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure   - Sen Obama 
 Obama’s job approval is at 37% 
Obama can open the Mall for illegals to protest our country yet he continues to barricade WWII memorial That’s an absolute disgrace

 President Obama wants to change the name of the   White House   because it is highly discriminating and not at all politically correct

My sense is that people are far angrier at the President than they are at Congress re the shutdown—an interesting turn

   @JoeyNoSocks: @Emmacochrane9 @ForQ2 @realDonaldTrump @Toure would you lend him $10 98% of people wouldn't No 
   @the2reggie: @realdonaldtrump personally I would ignore Toure everybody else does He is not relevant 
Do you believe what is going on in Washington with respect to Syria - these people don't have a clue 
@LonghornHomer  He is not smart enough to understand 
   @PhilKnudsen: @Toure @realDonaldTrump just curious Toure 
   @rgorman33: @realDonaldTrump @MrMarin88 LOL Way to go Trump!brilliant and funny Double threat guy    
@Toure  Why does a network allow a stupid racist like Toure to stay on the air when his ratings are so abysmal Can there be only one reason 
   @MrMarin88: Why does @realDonaldTrump always insist on calling ppl names and trying to taunt like a kid in a schoolyard Only stupid people

Iraq has granted Iran full air rights to fly over and arm Syria What did America accomplish with the Iraq war And now Syria 
This week will mark the 1 year anniversary of the attack in Benghazi that left 4 Americans dead  No answers 
Now Obama has set red line 2 with demand that Assad hands over Syria’s chemical weapons or it will face an attack

Isn't it intetesting that anybody who attacks President Obama is considered a racist by the real racists out there

 Speaking of our very stupid war with Iraq 
 @lucindamac  Thank you

   @ericjgiroux: @realDonaldTrump you need to make a run    Time will tell  
   @Robertr369: @realDonaldTrump if only Japan had the same courtesy Dec 1941    They should have told us they were coming like us with Syria  
 I'm a Republican but not a fan of the last George Bush-he also was a lousy President (Iraq etc.) In fact 
Former President Jimmy Carter is so happy that he is no longer considered the worst President in the history of the United States 
Syria has been given so much time that much of the things we were going to bomb have been moved into civilian areas A polititian's war 
 Just watching NBC News where our potential attack is being detailed-the exact ships 
   @BretBaier: Thx RT @JedediahBila Well done 

If Syria was forced to use Obamacare they would self-destruct without a shot being fired Obama should sell them that idea

 I am not angry at Russia (or China) because their leaders are far smarter than ours We need real leadership 
 I wonder how much our   leaders   have promised 
 Really bad news just announced concerning jobs Far fewer jobs created in August than anticipated Interest rates 
 We don't have the leadership 
 Did you ever see a situation so ridiculous as our President explaining what 
   @vindictivraider: @realDonaldTrump Well quit yapping about and run for office I like your ideas DO IT    
   @reallLTalk: @realDonaldTrump TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT     Thanks  
   @autumnallday: @realDonaldTrump I wish you'd run for office The country needs more minds like yours    Thank you  
   @KhalidNasser: @realDonaldTrump In this case 

The terrorists in Syria are calling themselves REBELS and getting away with it because our leaders are so         completely stupid 
   @JesseGunPlayJay: @realDonaldTrump You're a pussy shut up and stop crying @jayleno show is funny    No

   @gregfrech: @realDonaldTrump have you seen the video of the rebel commander cutting out and eating the Syrian soldiers heart & liver  
 While everyone is waiting and prepared for us to attack Syria 
 If you look at the horrible picture on the front page of the NY Times of the   rebels   executing prisoners 
Tell Congress to straighten out the many problems of our country before trying to be the policemen to the world Make America great again 
   @Whoopsydoodle: @realDonaldTrump god your the best Mr Trump    I like you tooooo  
   @Bchipper83: @realDonaldTrump haha I love how you just tell like it is You aren't who you are by not doing just that   Thank you  
 The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement Do NOT attack Syria 
 President Obama put himself in a very bad position when he talked about Syria crossing the RED LINE Amazingly 
   @Bchipper83: @realDonaldTrump haha I love how you just tell like it is You aren't who you are by not doing just that

   @SwagDaddyYol0: Why isn't @realDonaldTrump president instead of Obama     That is truly a good question  
We have given Syria so much time and information-there has never been such an instance in wartime history Syria is now fully prepared 
Why isn't the Arab League paying for everything and sending troops They want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves 
 The Arab League stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on Syria

 Be prepared 
China is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess They will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortune-& laugh at us 
 Obama now just wants to save face 
 Who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes Call it the   PLENTY OF NOTICE WAR    
   @JSDub901: @realDonaldTrump may be many things 
 Syria has prepared for an attack based on all of our   talk   - they have moved targeted ammunition and supplies to new locations.Amazing  
 For the first time in the history of military operations a country has broadcast what 
The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria-big mistake if he does not 

   @Joe1sPro: @realDonaldTrump the president of Syria is killing people inhumanly    But the so called   rebels   may be just as bad (or worse)  
   @kingsfansouth: @realDonaldTrump I usually agree with you 
   @jenconservative: @RKDrake @realDonaldTrump I would be totally surprised if the US even HAS any money to spend on Syria   We don't  
   @jaymiller283: @realDonaldTrump @jenconservative We need a strong minded POTUS in office before we enter into another war    
   @kswizzle43: @realDonaldTrump what would you do - give a solution vs being so critical    I would make America great again

   @OneMikex: @realDonaldTrump he's to soft of a president    Incompetent would be a better word  
   @jenconservative: @realDonaldTrump Not to mention we probably don't have the money to spend on another long war    So true  
 How bad has our   leader   made us look on Syria Stay out of Syria 
 If Obama attacks Syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed 
Is everyone seeing how incompetently our country is being run by watching the mess with Syria Our leaders don't know what they are doing

Let the Arab League take care of Syria Why are these rich Arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack 
 If we are going to continue to be stupid and go into Syria (watch Russia) 
 I wonder what the great generals like Patton 
 @walaa_3ssaf   No 
   @JanusDcjavu: @realDonaldTrump the one who talks much 
   @voicelikeariot_: @realDonaldTrump   @washingtonpost: Why Obama is giving up the element of surprise in Syria   Perhaps because he is stupid  
   @RonnieDunn1164: @realDonaldTrump @Hunterboss1996 a few billion more dollars 
 That said 
 Why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack Syria Why can't we just be quiet and 
I give the President's speech a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10 Not bad but room for improvement 
Why would anyone think Obama would attack Syria the day of his speech in Washington He doesn't want to detract from his press & glory 
   @jamieaydt: One day I hope to be successful & a bit controversial like @realDonaldTrump ...keeping things interesting & classy   Go for it

.@FoxNews legal analyst & former prosecutor @kimguilfoyle destroyed hack Schneiderman’s suit on @FNTheFive yesterday.She’s very sharp 
See @IvankaTrump on the cover of @HudsonMOD View the digital edition:http://issuu.com/hudsonmod/docs/hudsonmod_sept13_c2c … 
There has been a systematic targeting of the Tea Party by the Obama administration Now Schneiderman goes after me No coincidence 
 The lightweight hack Schneiderman told Ivanka that the “case is weak   and more  Meets with Obama & then files one day later  
Has AG Schneiderman been extorting his targets and their lawyers for contributions We will find out 
 @Givens1964  Very cool 
@AaronPha_q  Thanks 
 @d_murphy13                    
  @realDonaldTrump purely a political move if he met w/Obama 
I hope the NY tax payer appreciates the millions Schneiderman is about to waste on a small case I will litigate to victory 

 Thug Politics Lightweight hack Schneiderman meets with Obama on Thursday 
@ElmarosuElvin  Thank you 
My @foxandfriends int destroying Schneiderman’s frivolous suit which he brought after meeting Obama on Thurs.http://bit.ly/19UrKxE  


@TuleTwilight  Interesting 
@MichaelPMulhall @CNBC I don't think he can 

Why isn’t AG Schneiderman going after Democrat Jon Corzine and the $1.4 billion that is “missing?” 
Amazing AG Schneiderman sues a school w/ a 98% approval rating but doesn’t go after billion $ fraudsters all over Wall St 
I really enjoyed doing the show circuit this AM discussing lightweight AG Eric Schneiderman & the terrible job he has done for NY 
Gov Cuomo's Moreland Comm should be looking at AG Schneiderman shaking down those under investigation/ in litigation for campaign $$$

 What did our very stupid & ineffective A.G Eric Schneidean 
 After years of long stops then starts 
How can an Attorney General ask for campaign contributions during his evaluation of a case - a total sleazebag 
 Why did lightweight A.G Eric Schneiderman come to my office on numerous occasions begging for campaign contributions Also 
Why is it that Eric Schneiderman is considered a lightweight by so many and has failed to go after Jon Corzine and big abusers for billions 
 Why did failing A.G Eric Schneiderman

Spitzer never made 10 cents on his own-he worked for his very rich father (a friend of mine who never thought much of Eliot as a businessman 
Eliot Spitzer was a horrible Governor and A.G who ruined many good people and cost the Country billions of dollars in losses (and jobs)

   @Dstrick44: @realDonaldTrump @ricksmi54256322 You did run And you had your ass handed you Never ran stupid 
 In other words 
Unfortunately with some men when the poison kicks in (not me of course) there are no rules or guidelines in the military that will stop them 
 I was never a fan of Bush 2 FOR MANY REASONS 
 Our very stupidly run Country better stop being so   politically correct   or we won't have a Country to run anymore  
 Many generals and military leaders are now saying   I told you so    They say this will have big impact on military strength & national sec  
General says that the Armed Forces will be severely weakened if the large scale rape and sexual abuse problem is not brought under control 
Army officer who led a sexual abuse prevention unit was just fired after being charged with violently going after his wife.What is going on 
America's top Army general has warned of a crisis unless sexual abuse in the military is quickly brought undet control.Forces greatly hurt

   @damiranz: @realdonaldtrump  
@persvanstrom   Based on your picture I can see why - you look lost and in need of a cheap lifeline 
   @theRealRyanMatt: @realDonaldTrump i never seen apprentice or shark tank am i a fat loser    No 
@mikeluis93 Mark Cuban is a bully who is physically very soft and therefore should immediately stop wearing T shirts No strength 
 @Lord_Sugar can't hold a.candle to Donald.Trump - he is a laughing stock in Great Britain (but his show pays me lots of money 
 The success of Shark Tank over the years is a total joke compared to the success of The Apprentice 
@african11   But I love insulting people who don't have the goods but think they do

Just left Trump National Doral in Miami - under massive construction - The Blue Monster will be one of the greatest courses ever built 
   @OCAmericans: I only watch @NBC once a week to watch @realDonaldTrump's Apprentice  Great

I would absolutely kill Jon Stewart(?) in a debate - it would be no contest - he's not fast enough or smart enough (only obnoxious enough!) 
@SportsWalnuts   And Jon Stewart(?) is a very little man hiding behind lot's of high priced writers without which he would be nothing 
   @rosannascotto: Why are you giving away money this am @realDonaldTrump     Because so many people need help  
   @calikal69: @realDonaldTrump what do you think of @billmaher     I don't think of Bill Maher - and nobody else does either

 As I’ve said many times before 
Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow is a total phony –he should cherish his past—not run from it 
 If Jon Stewart is so above it all & legit 
What’s funny about the name “F**kface Von Clownstick” -- it was not coined by Jon Leibowitz-- he stole it from some moron on twitter 
Amazing how the haters & losers keep tweeting the name “F**kface Von Clownstick” like they are so original & like no one else is doing it

I hope you are watching the Apprentice...tonight's show is great and Brett Michaels is back 
Everybody loves @bretmichaels He’s a great champion and this is where he should be He agrees 

 .@TraceAdkins presents the NJ Coast Red Cross a $40 

What do you think of water boarding the Boston killer sometime prior to allowing our doctors to make him well I suspect he may talk 
 Make the Boston killer talk before our doctors make him better Once he is well he will say 
Don't forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9pm...you will love it 
I don't know how Al Michaels could have been drunk and arrested on Friday night if he was totally sharp on Saturday morning 
 Great sportscaster Al Michaels 
If the Boston killer applies for Obama Care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand 
NO MERCY TO TERRORISTS you dumb bastards 
 Can you imagine the Boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms 
Bullshit-Pop gave me knowledge and a relatively small amount of money (split between brothers and sisters) and I built it into over 9 bill

@NextLevelStoner   Great 
 You are right 
I know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually I'm a very compassionate person (with a very high IQ) with strong common sense 
Didn't the Boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away  We are not dealing with an innocent baby here-DEATH 
 When the stupid people start feeling sorry for the Boston killer and want to release him and give him medals 
 I hate when the news media 
The shirts and ties at Macy's are so good-beautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piece-l kicked his ass 
I just won a big Court decision (N.Y Post) against some character who claimed I owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties

 Sometimes we do things to build up experience and stamina to prepare 
Many of @TigerWoods’ ‘friends’ were quick to abandon him in his time of crisis Now Tiger knows who he can count on 
Many people look at successful people & don't see anything but the end result They don't see all the work that went into getting there

 When someone can discourage you

People buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals 
 It is very effective and a commonly used business tool

.@RNC report was written by the ruling class of consultants who blew the election Short on ideas Just giving excuses to donors 
   One of the most obvious lessons on @ApprenticeNBC is for the candidates to learn to think quickly   - Think Like a Champion  
Does anyone remember the fight @mcuban had w/ the referee—he was weak & pathetic—a non-athlete trying to live life thru his players

Boring & failing @NYMag’s 3rd rate political reporter @jheil had flunky @DanAmira write a totally false report about me today 
 He knows I don’t respect him

I watched the last two minutes of the @dallasmavs game last night--- I just loved watching them lose 
Press conference after CPAC speech this morning was excellent- lots of very professional reporters 
The CPAC speech went really well this morning--- first speaker--- standing ovation I really enjoyed it 
 When you think big 
   In the general course of human nature 
 .@mcuban has less TV persona than  any other person I can think of He’s an arrogant 
...Those stupid people bought @mcuban's company (of which he owned a piece) 
 There’s a reason @mcuban’s partners can’t stand him and on top of that 

CPAC attendees & fellow patriots - lines for my @CPACnews start at 7:00AM outside the Potomac Ballroom Make sure to get there early 
Really big crowd expected tomorrow morning at # CPAC2013 I look forward to it 
Via @espn: @dallasmavs “most likely scenario remains finishing a frustrating ninth in the West”http://es.pn/9fEWjz  
 When @mcuban had his own show 
I love watching dummy @mcuban promote on ok show named Shark Tank—but he is just a small part of that show 
 Interview w/ @AndreaTantaros discussing my WH tour offer

 Wow--just 1 day after my offer to fund all WH tours   Obama backtracks on decision to cancel all White House tours”   
 Do I get the credit for this Thank you!http://nydn.us/ZpYaGW

 Let us never negotiate out of fear

The losing team is now back in boardroom I can't discuss the team members or what's going on or what happens from here on out 
Re my hair-Should I change it What do you think 
It's true Dennis is really into this-very animated I have never seen him this way before 
Which team is your favorite 
 Re Omarosa: Nasty 
 Does anyone agree with Marilu that Gary 
Omarosa is very confident that the execs loved her concept & presentation 
That's an interesting talent that Marilu possesses 
Next she says she's being set up by Omarosa to fail....is somebody confused 
What  LaToya is saying Omarosa is one of the nicest people she's met 
 On the whole 
Gary as the Cat in the Hat He can work it out 
What do you think of Gary's definition of    f-u-n 
Trace delivers check to hospital in NYC:  American Red Cross must be grateful to Trace and his team for their tremendous work 
Honest Omarosa: she won't backstab-she'll come at you from the front 
Which team do you think has the edge in this interactive photo experience task assignment 
My 757 is incredible-I think the teams agree on that 
Will Team Power be able to withstand Omarosa as PM Smooth sailing is not expected 
Will Plan B miss Trace 
Firing Bret was a tough one for me-but Omarosa doesn't seem to mind 
Omarosa always promises and delivers high drama 
Trace and his team raised an amazing amount of $  Looks like a good season for charities 
There's definitely no love lost between Piers and Omarosa 
Bret had a target on his back from the get go 
That was some episode last week-we've got a great cast 
I will be live tweeting during the @ApprenticeNBC tonight at 9PM ET

.@Deadspin will never make it—they don’t understand graciousness or money—and best guy is leaving 
Dummies @Deadspin had their big payday taken from them by others in the media 
.@Deadspin guys are total losers—they had their story stolen right from under their bad complexions—other media capitalized 
Alabama people are saying their team has real football & real girlfriends—not good for Notre Dame—but they’ll be back 
I still say Te'o did this in order to get sympathy for the Heisman vote—thankfully he did not win 
Te’o’s imaginary girlfriend is one of the great cons of all time—or he’s very stupid 
The interview was great for @Oprah and terrible for Lance Armstrong 
.@Oprah was great-- amazing that she got Lance Armstrong to totally destroy his life Why did he ever do that interview 
Lance Armstrong did himself great harm last night Lawsuits & failure will follow him 
@tman99us @_KatherineWebb  That's Shaquille O'Neal's shoe 



All time hit leader Pete Rose should now be in the Baseball Hall Of Fame He has paid his penalty 
.@Boeing stock went way down because of 787- so I just bought stock in @Boeing- great company 
The interview with Oprah will cause Lance Armstrong huge legal and financial problems- sometimes it is better to go into a corner and hide 
 I'll bet Lance Armstrong wishes he didn't do the interview with Oprah-- he's saying to himself   what was I thinking    
.@HBO should fire @BillMaher and bring back @DennisDMZ- someone that is actually funny 
.@BillMaher’s show is great for helping me get to sleep--- better than Sominex 
 .@BillMaher needs to cut back on the pot 
Dumbass @BillMaher has still not given me the 5 million he committed to charity--- we just presented him with a demand notice 
Brent Musburger did himself a great favor by saying what everyone was thinking- he is much more popular now than before 
.@ESPN’s apology(Brent Musburger) was a disgrace to broadcasting--- stop being so politically correct 
IMO--- Manti Te’o was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the Heisman Trophy 
Can it just be new age that Manti Te’o fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax 
Not believable that Manti Te’o was in love for one year with a girl he never met- she then died He is either very stupid 
...or mentally troubled (or a con) 
Congratulations to Tom Scocca and Timothy Burke of @Deadspin for exposing the Manti Te’o fiasco

Next year I will be changing the name of 800 acre Doral to Trump National Doral It will be the best resort in the country—Miami is hot 
I will start reviewing various political reporters etc & websites as to their professionalism & fairness—many people asking for this 
How could Obama leave those American heroes out to die in Benghazi  And he continues to lie to the public 
What is your thought as to why Obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications 
Nice to see Obama released a situation room photo from Sandy  How about releasing the photo taken during Benghazi 
Everybody knows why Obama would not show his college applications --- they are just not willing to say 
 If I would have offered Obama a billion dollars to show his records 
My video response to President Obama's lack of transparency.http://youtu.be/tYgW3_w3TS8?hd=1 … 

I will soon be releasing my response to the fact that President Obama refused to show his applications and records to the public 
President Obama missed the deadline 
Obama is a terrible negotiator He bails out Chrysler and now Chrysler wants to send all Jeep manufacturing to China--and will 
Why is Obama’s auto bailout now creating jobs in China  He is ruining American industry 
 To all @MittRomney supporters 

You know the world is crazy when New York gets hit by a hurricane-- and Florida doesn't 
Let's continue to destroy the competitiveness of our factories & manufacturing so we can fight mythical global warming China is so happy 
Do you believe @algore is blaming global warming for the hurricane 
From 1954 to 1960 there were 10 major hurricanes that hit the East Coast 
It's 10 AM: Two hours to go for Obama to easily pick up millions for charity 
   The successful man will profit from his mistakes and try again in a different way   -- Dale Carnegie  
@stass13 Thanks 
Obama is now standing in a puddle acting like a President--give me a break 
A lot of people are concerned about which charity my $5M will be donated to  The onus is on Obama to first release his records 
 President Obama 
 President Obama 

 Congratulations to @MittRomney on getting the @DMRegister 
Spoiler--@dennisrodman has really got his act together so far on the upcoming season of @CelebApprentice 

How does a dummy like @billmaher get a television show--& his ratings stink You'd think @HBO could do a lot better 
A lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with Obama’s lack of transparency I don't blame them 
 There is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the $5M to a charity of Obama’s choice 

.@Disney's acquisition of Lucas Film is a smart deal for both sides  Disney just bought a great brand which will keep producing revenue 
 In the spirit of transparency 
Today Barack Obama is standing in water in NJ Remember on election day that he has put the US underwater 
How many illegal foreign donations will Obama collect this final week Another scandal ignored by the liberal media.http://bit.ly/RPmehP  
 Congratulations Kevin Gabriel on your amazing article If I were a journalist this would be the next Watergate 

 “I didn’t consider him American He seemed like an international individual.”–Sohale Siddiqi 
 .@USATODAY--go back to your old logo & fast--you're losing your readers by the thousands   No charge    


 .@oreillyfactor called me a   master marketeer   last night--I am not I am a great builder--I build great things & people come  

 Part 1 of my @jimmyfallon interview discussing my $5M offer to Obama 
Kevin Garnett's response to Ray Allen last night was that of a great competitor--nothing wrong--in fact it was terrific A champion 
 I was standing with @SHAQ when a young high school star 

I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity-- or to which charity the money will go 
The President has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5M for his favorite charity Looking like he won't be doing it What is he hiding 
 Watch me tonight on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon 

The polls & momentum  are trending towards @MittRomney Don't let the hurricane change your thinking 
Fans shouldn't worry  We have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of @CelebApprentice appropriately due to the storm 

Maybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm 
Scary  Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years  4 more years 

Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition Hiding something 
@digiphile @RedCross RT if you think Pres.Obama should release his records to get $5M for charity--for Red Cross or another great charity 
Glad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5  Taylor is terrific 
 Let’s be honest 
 How did Obama go to a Las Vegas fundraiser on 9.12 
   Without focus 
I never fall for scams  I am the only person who immediately walked out of my ‘Ali G’ interview 
Another great cause Obama could send my $5M donation to is a charity for 9/11 First Responders They are American heroes 
 My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing the 57th St crane 

These last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% GDP Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history 
The election is trending towards @MittRomney Americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline 

 The Trump Tower atrium is such a great place & kept thousands of people warm & safe during the storm--thanks 
.@MatthewLumby  Charity should get the money 
 @neilmsdunn Dopey 
 Remember this: Obama wants to raise taxes 
Don't let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states 
 People having a great time in the Trump Tower atrium ---   unlike others 
 I am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap 
 Because of the hurricane 
 Not only giving out money 
Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars 
I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm 
The water damage to NYC is amazing The winds were bad but the water was worse 
 All weights are on crane's wrong side ---  very precarious below 
 If authorities need direct view from top of Trump Tower 
 Direct view of crane from apartment window Crane was never properly secured 
We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atrium--they are seeking refuge Free coffee and food 
 So far the hurricane is being handled very well in NY 
Many people walked out on Madonna's concert when she told them to vote for Obama Years ago I walked out because the concert was terrible 

Obama lied 100% about Libya and the killings--emails are absolute He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies 
 Dave Letterman @Late_Show said during my interview that Obama was   probably   born in the US--the word   probably   is a disaster for Obama  
I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go 

 .@BillMaher 
 I guess @BillMaher saw my ratings on the @Late_Show the other night where Letterman beat Leno Bill 
 While @BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman 
.@BetteMidler talks about my hair but I'm not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body --- so I won't Is this a double standard 
 But whenever she sees me 
I never liked @BetteMidler's persona or singing and haven't heard her name in years 
 Now grotesque @BetteMidler is into the Trump act --- trying to become 
relevant again  
Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers --- I agree 
 A lot changed when David Letterman said    he was probably born in this country  --- the word probably is a total disaster for Obama  

I defended @StarJonesEsq when she lied about her stomach operation to lose weight --- only to get blindsided by her on the @todayshow 

 I am going to the @nyjets game with @woodyjohnson4 
@johnsununu is taking major heat for calling the president lazy But the president stated his weakness is that he is lazy Fight on John 
@BernardMcGuirk That's more than O'Reilly did ...and he is supposed to be my friend You're terrific 
@Bernard McGuirk Thanks for being so nice and defending me on O'Reilly...you're terrific 
Alert...The president knew that the ambassador was being attacked  in Benghazi He did nothing...he is no leader 
 @DonnyDeutsch tries so hard to be a star But 
 I put @DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request 
I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President 
The TODAY Show should call me about who to put on the show— I know more about people who get ratings than anyone 

I hear they are very unhappy w/ Arianna and @huffingtonpost at @AOL I’ll bet she won’t be there for long 


 If Obama doesn't accept my offer to be fully transparent 
 If my offer is refused 
Barack Obama has everything to gain Why would anyone ever deny $5M to charity 



I have decided to add a caveat to my offer Obama can't decide to send my $5M to Rev Wright if he releases his records 
My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohio--make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day Know you can Must win Ohio 
Where's the transparency Despite Obama's denial @sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with Jeremiah Wright 

Pretty audacious for Obama to call @MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write 
 By the way 
...Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction 
Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester The Middle East is a mess Yet Colin Powell still endorses him Wonder why 
 Be careful of an Obama   bomb   to win election Would be a horrible thing to do  
The election is still close but trending toward @MittRomney He leads all national polls and Obama's likeability is imploding VOTE 
Wow Letterman show @Late_Show won the ratings last night big time--and guess who was his guest DJT 
 One of my many Twitter followers suggested Obama should take my offer & give $1 


@crushthespirit  True 
What a dumb mistake AOL made buying the @huffingtonpost How much longer will Arianna last--I predict not much 
 @MikeMpef Thanks 
@destiny_113 @StephenAtHome  I agree 
 @MaureenPeronne @Late_Show  Thanks 
@MRJMF1 @Late_Show Thanks I will 
Stupid Arianna @huffingtonpost hired the man who ruined the once-great NYTimes Business Section 
...a real loser named Tim O'Brien--and it's never recovered 
Dopey Arianna @huffingtonpost is really after me--boring story after boring story...but I hear she is in big trouble 
I knew last year that @TIME Magazine lost all credibility when they didn't include me in their Top 100 
 I will soon start naming magazines that I think will fold--I predicted Newsweek 
@yewkalaylee  Great idea 
@seketa77  I hope so for the charity's sake 
@TylarReese Thanks Tylar 

@LianneOnLife I love the Wounded Warriors--Obama should choose that as his $5M charity 
@RyanSeven Sounds like a good idea 
@Erizzle05  Only because he has something to hide 
.@SabrinaSiddiqui  Re: Taylor and Conor--great news for Taylor 
 Based on the ovation last night from the Letterman @Late_Show audience 
....instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause 
Another great charity that the $5M could go to just a recommendation to the Pres - the Wounded Warriors represented so well by @TraceAdkins 
Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi 
Letterman @Late_Show was great last night I had a lot of fun You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the $ for charity 
   The dealmaker is cunning 
It is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop $5M from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent 
Doing David Letterman @Late_Show tonight at 11:30 1st nite of Sweeps.Going into the lion's den but I've been there many times before Enjoy 
Six days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires 
 For someone who demanded 20 years of Mitt's tax returns 


I hope Derek Jeter’s recovery is going well  He is a very special player and a great guy  New York loves him @yankees 

@politico has really become a laughing stock of good political reporting 
What will be the response on Wednesday If Obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity 
 @michellemalkin I fully supported McCain but when he lost 
.@Mark_Sanchez shouldn’t be too upset over @EvaLongoria  He will always do great 
I am offering the chance for Barack Obama to redistribute $5M to any charity of his choice  Everyone wins  Take the deal 
“Our side needs Donald Trump.” -- @AnnCoulter on @seanhannity’s show last night  Thanks Ann 
.@BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv--Why did you choose me as one of the 10 Most Fascinating People of the Year last season (and more than once?) 
 .@BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv will apologize to me just like she did when I was right about @Rosie Besides 
 .@BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv  Barbara 
Still waiting for an explanation about why @GiulianaRancic & @BillRancic did not name their son Donald  Unbelievable 
Miss Universe 2012 Pageant will be airing live on @nbc & @Telemundo december 19th Open invite stands for Robert Pattinson 
Excited to announce that @GiulianaRancic & @BravoAndy will be hosting the 2012 Miss Universe Pageant Great ratings for Miss Universe 
How does @michellemalkin get a conservative platform She is a dummy--just look at her past 
The @DailyBeast will die just like Newsweek--same management 
   The fact that we still don't know these things about Barack Obama is the point   @MonicaCrowley on @seanhannity's show last night  


 My @gretawire interview discussing my $5M charitable offer to Obama 


   Trump offers $5 million for Obama college 
 Just stated by a total pro:   You are the only one who has the guts to say what we are all thinking    
Glad to hear North Carolina is solid for @MittRomney  It started trending for Mitt solidly after my speech at the @NCGOP convention 
 In light the Benghazi emails released last night 
  By releasing his records 
Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets  Why can't he release his records  Especially when $5M is going to charity 
I am happy to donate $5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses  All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American people 

I just learned that @politico has no credibility--total phonies that don't report the truth A puppet of Obama 
Glad to hear @seanhannity supports my offer to Obama  As Sean says “it is an easy $5 million to charity  What does Obama have to lose?” 
Third rate @politico took every negative tweet or response they could find & put it out--when in fact the response is incredibly positive 
 My offer to Obama is about transparency In 2008 
RT @ReutersPolitics: Trump to give $5 million to charity if Obama releases recordshttp://reut.rs/P2JjAw  
 Virtually all Presidents and candidates including John McCain 
The response has been fantastic--- actually overwhelming Thank you 
 As stated 
 You have all been waiting-- the response has been amazing Watch my announcement now 
All predictions re: my 12 o'clock release are totally incorrect  Stay tuned 
Story will be released today at 12 noon EST on Twitter and Facebook 
   Invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the attack   -- Sun Tzu  


If you like having the world collapse and being told America is leading from behind--vote Obama 
No wonder @BBC is in such big trouble & boss was just fired--they are lost 
.@BBC should never have played that piece of garbage documentary--& yet the phones are ringing off the hook to play the course 
 ...that it was hard not to end up rooting for Trump    
 Thank you to @DailyTelegraph reviewer @NeilMidgley who stated   'You've Been Trumped' was so biased in favour of the protesters  
.@bobschieffer did an excellent job as debate moderator last night I only wish Mitt was more aggressive 
 Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert & Kristen.I don't have time except to say   Robert 
 Last night was the first time Obama said   we   instead of   I   in respect to Bin Laden's killing  
Barack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden--- now he wants all of the credit 
My announcement is tomorrow 
Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject 
China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own 
 Mitt Romney must start congratulating the Navy Seals and military on Bin Laden’s killing 
.@MittRomney should have been more aggressive last night Yet some polls have him winning the debate 
 My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing last night’s presidential debate 
 The military and Navy Seals should be given more credit for Bin Laden's death 
 When the military informed Obama that they had Bin Laden 

Lance Armstrong fought for 7 years & then just ran out of energy Very sad story--although they caught him red handed.He definitely cheated 
   Casting sometimes is fate and destiny more than skill and talent 
 No matter what happens in the election 
 I always said that @lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges By stopping 

The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy-- and I mean much more 
Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night Viewership will be way down 
I will be doing @SquawkCNBC at 7:30 

 .@MittRomney looks much calmer 
Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight Always treated me fairly 
 Well this is it 
I have watched @Linda_McMahon for years-- she will bring jobs & business back to Connecticut--incredible woman 
My good friends in Connecticut have a great opportunity to send an amazing businesswoman to Washington Vote for @Linda_McMahon for Senate 

@BRANDONTHRILL  Thanks--a great compliment 
@trottofficial Thanks--and doing great business from all over the world 
Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit All he did is say O.K 

I look forward to @MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs 
Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama---just wait and see 
.@bobschieffer will a great job tonight--he is a real pro and respected by both sides 
 According to @SFGate 
 Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart In a couple of years 
 Obama is an easy target on foreign policy.@MittRomney has many openings to attack 
   This is my last election After my election I have more flexibility   Obama to @MedvedevRussiaE discussing our nuclear arsenal  

Obama planted that @nytimes story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate He wants Libya and China off the table 

 @LarryLivermore @tufnrs73  Dopey 
@DukePGA Ken--Thanks--I am proud of you Great job on tour this year--I always knew 
@Patti0713 Thanks 
@Yea4Country @politico  Thanks--it needs a lot of work 
@AustinMay Austin--thanks 

...now @AlexSalmond doesn't like me--who cares 

The @BBC is widely criticized for a lack of professionalism We dealt with a Roger Mosey--a total lightweight who doesn't have a clue 
 .@Toure I felt very sorry for you during your meltdown on @PiersMorgan He drove you insane but 
The @BBC is in total disarray I know personally how bad they are -- pathetic.http://nyti.ms/RdyUSx  
My son Don and his wife Vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named Spencer Frederick --very thrilling 
 @kennedy_mac Dopey 

Last week I had @SInow's tweet of the week and the most retweeted @MittRomney mention twice   Can anyone else top that  Don't think so 
Had a great time watching the @nyjets @Patriots game yesterday at Gillette Stadium Great and exciting game 
 The Lion 
I wish tonight's debate would cover more than foreign policy 

Don't let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected--be careful Republicans 
 .@Toure 
Autism rates through the roof--why doesn't the Obama administration do something about doctor-inflicted autism We lose nothing to try 
We should march on Washington re:autism--with leadership & common sense the numbers would drop precipitously 
 Lots of autism and vaccine response Stop these massive doses immediately Go back to single 

New Hampshire is a critical state for both candidates this year I got to know New Hampshire and love it 


 My @foxandfriends interview discussing Lance Armstrong losing his titles 
Stay tuned for my big Obama announcement--- probably on Wednesday.  
People are going crazy with my comments on Diet Coke (soda) Let's face it--this stuff just doesn't work It makes you hungry 
 The anti-wind turbine movement in Scotland against @AlexSalmond is amazing--keep going Scots 
Obama should stop talking about wind turbines--they are a disaster for a country or community & are very expensive & unreliable 
I will be live tweeting during the debate tonight 
 Derek 
Gas prices are at crazy levels--fire Obama 
Sleepy Eyes @chucktodd owes @jack_welch an apology Jack is right on unemployment--the new jobless claims make 7.8% an impossibility 
   They succeed 
Don Butler and executives are doing a great job at @Cadillac--- the cars are fantastic 
The biggest problem with A-Rod is he is bad for the chemistry of the Yankees--- he must go 
Fort Hood shooting should be declared a terror attack Respect the wounded and dead 
Good luck to Derek on his operation I know it will be a success--- he is a great champion 
Derek must move back into one of my buildings immediately It will be lucky for him like in past 
Derek Jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in Trump World Tower 
7.8% unemployment number is a complete fraud as evidenced by the jobless claims number released yesterday.Real unemployment is at least 15% 
.@MittRomney's @RNC convention came in over $3M under budget  Barack’s @DNC convention is over $10M in debt  What a surprise 
 No surprise 
 Can't wait for @VanityFair to fold which 
 .@VanityFair's terrible piece on Mitt's faith is a new low 
 Where were all the @VanityFair exposes on   When Rev Wright disciples go to Washington    Sad  

 Rev @BillyGraham is a great man and so is his son 
Rev.@BillyGraham is doing tremendous work this election cycle educating the Christian community on @MittRomney 
Both Barack and @MittRomney were excellent at the Al Smith dinner last night 
A lot of the @Yankees should be ashamed of their play in the post season They are lucky they don't have to deal with George Steinbrenner 
I hope @boyscouts of America handle their problems a lot better than the board at Penn State did You can't do any worse 
@rginn_1 Toledo is a great place--I've been there & worked in Cincinnati for 2 years--I love Ohio 
@RickyTheBitch @ladygaga I think Gaga is great--her 1st major appearance at my Miss Universe Pageant in Vietnam/6 yrs ago Should give me 25% 
Newly released NH poll has @MittRomney with a 1 point lead Mitt will pull away next week 
 Obama has called Libya attack   a bump in the road   and   not optimal   Just come clean already--tell Americans the truth  
Maybe Derek Jeter should ask A-Rod about renting his apartment next year Very soon A-Rod won't need a place in NYC 
Yes--I will be live tweeting during the final debate this coming Monday

 So many tweets & stories on Stewart/Pattinson Look 
 @D_Hastie @lancearmstrong  No 


.@lancearmstrong really blew it--went down in flames--too bad 

Why would Ohio listen to Bruce Springsteen reading his lines Be careful or I will go to Ohio and @MittRomney will win it 
@JakfromBk Thanks 
 @MisterJoe49 @Yankees I agree 
 Obama said   not optimal   to Ambassador & embassy killings--bad word usage for a Harvard graduate  

@evaemery Never give up You have what it takes 
Great decision by Donald Graham @Newsweek to sell I'll now have to take my newsweek covers off the wall 
 With Barry Diller & Tina Brown in charge 

Something really bad happened to the @Yankees psyche--much like our President 
.@Yankees should get rid of A-Rod ASAP--I can't watch this guy anymore 
.@evaemery Thanks--you sound great 
@Rosie @realDonaldTrump  Thanks for the info Rosie--get well 
I'll be making a major announcement on President Obama next week--stay tuned

@waycooljr37 @Nationals Bob Kraft & Coach Bill are far too smart 
@YouthPastorDarr @seanhannity @megynkelly @JohnCena Good luck 
 @toddulu @Nationals I hope that's the reason--otherwise 
@donmarie16  A total professional 
 @CalumSpence Greatly appreciated 
@Morali_Arch Great to meet you also 
 @NeanderthalMan1 @MittRomney  I was referring 
@crazymom28 I have a friend that wants to meet your sister 

The last time I visited China I couldn't believe all the construction You can go up with a project in a week--no red tape 
It's Thursday How much money did Barack Obama waste today on crony green energy projects 
 Clinton commented in Ohio today that @MittRomney is right 
 When Strasburg leaves @Nationals for another team for more money 
Bad sign for Obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states Their internals must be horrendous 
 While the next season of @CelebApprentice is packed w/ All Stars 
Derek Jeter @yankees wants to rent an apartment Derek--only in a Trump building--Trump is lucky for you 
 Now there is talk of A-Rod being shipped to @Marlins If A-Rod is not a @yankee next year 
 I think the @yankees will win today Unlike A-Rod 
@NickJ102 @antbaxter I don't want to fall asleep in public 
Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen- but I'm right If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider 
 My @extratv interview with @MarioLopezExtra discussing my @yankees tweets 
@darbizman  Thanks 
@G_Harwood  Because they are either jealous or losers (or both) 
 A reader just sent me the following:  

Newsweek ending print edition--sad Now my Newsweek covers mean nothing--they lost all credibility TIME to follow 
@PartyCoveMag @espn @politico @WSJ  Thanks 
 @loveandgarbage  Dopey--who went bankrupt 
   The biggest thrill in the world is entertaining the public 
 @womenzbinder Check the records 
@antbaxter @MailOnline  They only suffered by watching your 3rd rate documentary (which bombed) 
@jeff_coles  I will--thanks 
Lots of response to my Pattinson/Kristen Stewart reunion She will cheat again--100 certain--am I ever wrong 
Looking forward to honoring the great Dogan family & the success of the Trump Towers project in Istanbul @FollowTurkey Annual Gala Dinner 
 Alert--US jobless claims up 46 
Amazing--my tweets are covered across every spectrum from @espn to @politico to @WSJ 
   When we're talking about math that doesn't add up 
Obama's spending and borrowing is burying America and destroying our children's future Does he even care 


.@ashleycam2883 Re: Libya--Hillary took the blame for Obama 
Mitt's proposed tax cuts for the middle class will spur record economic growth 
 Major grudge match this weekend between @nyjets & @Patriots I have a dilemma 
 Under his administration 
If Obama goes after Mitt's private sector experience in the next debate then Mitt should ask for Obama's college records--all of them 
.@mystikangel  Bring @johnrich back He is back 


What is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all We should be given credit for taking this risk 
Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight 
Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart She cheated on him like a dog & will do it again--just watch He can do much better 
Michael Vick of the Philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback 
Initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped See what happens when I am not mentioned 
Just read about my friend @HulkHogan--he was set up--too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles 
@BillRancic  Bill- You should have named your beautiful son Donald 
 Joe Girardi @Yankees must play his starters 
 While the @Yankees look like they quit and are finished 

CC is a great pitcher and can handle pressure--@Yankees will win tonight So far my predictions have all been correct 
George Steinbrenner @yankees would have gotten out of A-Rod's contract three years ago...but put A-Rod in tonight 
 Obama talks about what he is going to do--why the hell didn't he just do it 
Obama at big debate disadvantage--he just can't get away from his bad record 
.@MittRomney scored last night on both substance and style 

...Bad decisions can be devastating 
Obama was beaten but not knocked out  He lives to fight another day But in the real world presidents are not given a second chance 
All the guys that said @MittRomney would lose are rapidly coming on board  Mitt will remember the early helpers 
 If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically 
Robert Bryce @NYPost--Congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines & how destructive they are Windmills are a disaster 
 Remember 
 Wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds 
Great article on wind turbines by Robert Bryce in today's @NYPosthttp://bit.ly/V5AwvJ  
Really enjoyed discussing @yankees yesterday with @RealMicihaelKay I am a long time Yankee fan 

@marileenelson Thanks 

 My twitter followers will soon be over 2 million--& all the   biggies   It's like having your own newspaper  
My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth 
Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win Don't put it past him 
Obama did much better than he did last time--but still lost decisively 
Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night I don't 
 Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal If we do not win energy as a country 
 I still love Derek 
 Remember 
 At the debate 
 Verlander pitched great 
Stupid George Will gave @MittRomney no chance 3 months ago Take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy 
 George Will said   best debate he ever saw   If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting  
Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other At one point it looked like they would come to blows.  
 Obama better than last time 
 You talk tough 
Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama No wonder nothing gets done 
.@MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems Obama has no answer 
Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton 
 Obama weak on immigration All words 
Obama is looking rhetorical and weak @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp 
 Obama just said @MittRomney was   a very successful investor  --- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility  
Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it It's all talk 
.@MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential 
Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices 
Good response on jobs by @MittRomney 
Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs 
Why hasn't Obama created jobs 
 Getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say   let's get ready to rumble    
I was just told by one of the top @PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country Very nice compliment--I agree 
We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age.They just don't believe we would 
@drumline_mormon  It is selling great at Macy's--thanks 
 For political purposes only 
Great win last night by Peyton Manning & @Denver_Broncos in San Diego coming from 24 points behind on the road Very impressive 
If the @yankees can somehow beat Verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series And I will go to games 6& 7 so they will win 
Get ready for tonight 
@MissUSA  Olivia--we love you You are doing a great job 
.@MittRomney--if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records & transcripts--he will quiet down quickly 
Good luck @MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great 
Congratulations to @JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud  @DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice 
I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in Benghazi 

 Between Libya 
.@reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party--hope he gets the credit he deserves 
.@antbaxter I tried watching but fell asleep 
 .@History's wonderful   The Men Who Built America   with me on tonight at 9 -- bad timing 
 Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate 
 The Coca Cola company is not happy with me--that's okay 
It's amazing--my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @CNBC draw the highest ratings And they get bigger week by week--thanks folks 
Had a great time with @PaulRyanVP last night on the Intrepid Paul is terrific 
Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row At least he is consistent 
All the morons that cause the controversy in Scotland have made my development far more successful than anticipated 

 Diet Coke tweet had a monster response--dammit 
.@antbaxter  Thanks for helping promote & make Trump International Golf Links Scotland so successful--you stupid fool 
 .@antbaxter  Your documentary died many deaths You have 
 I can confirm the reports--@BillRancic 
 .@rupertmurdoch is absolutely right 
Verlander is great but  very beatable Does not have a good ERA in playoff games 
I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers 
I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight We'll all be watching @MittRomney 
Lots of pressure on Obama tonight--even more than A-Rod If he doesn't perform well it could be over 
I hope A-Rod has a great night for the Yankees--he owes it to them--especially with Derek hurt 
@jbluvx2 Happy Birthday 
Gov Gary Johnson pulling votes from @MittRomney--Don't waste your vote Obama must go 

 Based on very popular demand 
   The invisible hand of the market always moves faster and better than the heavy hand of government   -- @MittRomney  
   Sometimes the best thing you can do is just let things ride 
Donald J Trump  
 The more Diet Coke 

 Tune in  
 If @MittRomney has a good debate tomorrow night 

   Romney 
Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us 
Looking forward to honoring the great Dogan family and the success of the Trump Towers project in Istanbul @FollowTurkey Annual Gala Dinner 
A-Rod should donate his contract to charity He doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform He is a $30M/yr rip off 
Looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @MittRomney supporters at the Intrepid Mitt's doing well 

The @brooklynnets logo is plain and boring--but if they win it won't matter 
.@antbaxter's documentary on my Scottish golf club was so boring and wrong He is a small-timer with no talent 
 My @foxandfriends interview discussing @JoeBiden's performance 
Barack Obama is not who you think he is Most overrated politician in US history 
Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications Boy would that create a mess He is not who you think 
 Wing Whackers: the reality is 
ttp://bit.ly/O5IV3O  
 I don't get @JerrySeinfeld's stumbling 
 Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke- let's face it 
Lots of response on Derek--but I told him his apartment was lucky -- We love Derek 
 In case you missed it 
.@ArsenioOFFICIAL Why not everyone else is using it--- it's available at @Macys 
@SchroedBoss @ErichFSchroeder  and your parents meant the world to me 
A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice 
@mcginness1 Thanks--a great country 
Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma 
 .@SbelSbel3555  Sorry 
.@ErichFSchroeder Your dad was a great man & great leader 
@LeighAnnMac Thank you 
I love @LibertyUniversity--such great people 
A-Rod is just not making it We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great 
I feel guilty not having attended the last two @yankees games (losses)  They would have won 
Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing 
Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks 
.@MittRomney's poll numbers are looking really good One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout.  
I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke 
 No 

Yankees can win today Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher 
A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat Time for him to step up and leave 
Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night 
.@Yankees are in trouble without Derek Try A-Rod at short- get him some confidence 
A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion 
So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg- they deserved to lose 
Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away Scrape and paint before too late 
 Tonight 
Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason.  
They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer 
Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series 
I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win 
Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve-- they would have won 
 When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say    what were we doing    
 I told you 
   Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality   -- Warren G Bennis  
When an employee leaves me and begs to come back--I never let them Loyalty is very important 
I look forward to Tuesday night's presidential debate--I wonder if Obama will use my name again 
Very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate 
   What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy   --@PaulRyanVP  
Obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families The price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected 
 With our amazing All Star cast 
Great to hear that our loyal @CelebApprentice fans are happy with today's announcement of the new cast This will be something special 
.@dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act 
I'm going to the @Yankees game tonight to root them on--they always win when I am there 
My Scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world--a great honor for me 

Doing the @todayshow with @MLauer was great- I really like Matt 

   There are many ways of going forward 
@dennisrodman @ApprenticeNBC Great to have you back for the best season yet 
ObamaCare is a complete disaster Many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it Terrible 
   Wing bangers  -- the name given to wind turbines by bird lovers for the thousands of birds they kill in the U.S  
British PM Cameron is making a fool of himself by wasting billions of pounds on unwanted & environment destroying Scottish windmills 
Going over to @TodayShow now to introduce @ApprenticeNBC cast etc.-- watch 








Looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment 

Another sign that @jack_welch is right New government labor report casts even more doubt on the September jobs datahttp://www.aei-ideas.org/2012/10/new-government-report-casts-even-more-doubt-on-the-september-jobs-data/ … 

It's Thursday and only 26 days until the election How many illegal donations from China and Saudi Arabia did Obama collect today 

Our foreign policy decisions are dumbest in U.S history 
Live tweeting during tonight's VP debate...should be a great time 
How the hell does the Libyan government get off telling our embassy security they can't have loaded guns for protection 
 Why the hell did we help the Libyan   rebels   in the first place That is the real scandal  
Outright disgusting--the Obama administration has continually stonewalled and lied to US Amb Sean Smith's motherhttp://drudge.tw/RxV7IN  
I suspect @JoeBiden could do well tonight Don't be fooled by his gaffes He is a seasoned and feisty debater 
If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish A beater is always a beater--just watch 
Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well 
$30M a year and A-Rod is now relegated to the bench @yankees would have lost if Girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction) 
I guess they have Lance Armstrong cold Brutal report A waste of taxpayer money to take down an American hero 
.@Apprenticenbc cast will be announced tomorrow at 7:30am ET on the @todayshow with @MLauer 
 Staff at Trump Park Avenue disliked A-Rod--to put it   mildly   -- The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter  
Asking why my dislike of A-Rod--dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal 
Great move to take A-Rod out of game Now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation (drugs) 
Raul Ibanez did something never done in baseball history Amazing move by manager Joe G 
 After Obama's '07 racist speech on Katrina relief 
 USA Today has the worst   new   newspaper logo in the business--go back to the original  

   When everything seems to be going against you 
@usa67us  Thank you 
 Must read article on Obama's illegal fundraising from abroad 


 Congratulations to @FLGovScott on getting an   A   grade from @CatoInstitute on his fiscal policy Rick is a fantastic governor  
 Even with lower profit projections 
I am more concerned about Biden in the debate than I am about Obama Be careful on Thursday night 
   You have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird    -- @MittRomney  

A-Rod must be dropped in the Yankees line-up tonight if they want to win He simply can't perform without drugs 

Receiving thousands of thank you letters from @LibertyU students for my convocation speech The honor was all mine  Great people 

47M on food stamps Over 23M Americans unemployed 50% of college grads unemployed And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird 
Has Barack Obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations Media 
 I just had to fire someone 
 27 days until America's greatest test since our founding In this election 
   It doesn't matter who you vote for--it matters who is counting the votes   Be careful of voter fraud  
Obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate Let's see how he reacts under pressure 
 Remember 
I don't think Obama will do well in the second debate--he is psyched out just like A-Rod 
   I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats On this 
How can British PM Cameron spend so much money on Scottish windmills which are ruining the countryside 
 By popular request I will also be tweeting live during the Vice Presidential debate  Thursday night It will be very interesting 
.@DavidLetterman @Late_Show fully apologized last night for calling me a racist Thank you David--we are again friends 
The public is about to learn a lot more information on Barack Obama and his true background in the coming weeks… 
Now that Obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran  He is desperate 
Mitt’s subsequent rise in the polls post-debate shows that the American public can still spot a real winner 
 “In order to build your wealth and improve your business smarts 
 With these record high gas prices 
Looking forward to live tweeting during the rest of the debates Will be a lot of fun 
 When will the unemployment numbers be corrected Sadly 

George Will is a political moron Last month he said Romney couldn't win 
 In the end 
 Drop A-Rod in the order and cut his salary based on unreported drug use Also 

Why isn't Obama protecting us from ridiculous gas prices 
 California gas prices going thru the roof 
Greece should get out of the euro & go back to their own currency--they are just wasting time

Why are we still giving billions of dollars we don't have in foreign aid to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt 
 I will be speaking Monday 
 (10 A.M.) at Liberty University 
The media is pathetic Our embassies are savaged by radicals while Obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @MittRomney 
What a coincidence that Obama's good friends in Libya and Egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies 
 With allies like Egypt and Libya 
Shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11 
Obama told @NBC that Egypt is no longer an ally They used to be until he pushed out Mubarak 
Filming of the record 13th season of @CelebApprentice has started Be sure to be on the lookout for future updates 

 If Obama was smart 

With the high prices of corn to continue expect even more inflation on the price of food 
Obama's foreign policy is a complete and total disaster--the worst President we have ever had 
We threw our ally Mubarak overboard and Egypt is now our enemy Great going Obama--Israel is in trouble 
This is all about American weakness and an incompetent President 

 Weakness 
   The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary   -- Vince Lombardi  
Our $16T national debt is now bigger than our $15T GDP If Obama is re-elected watch for an economic meltdown in 2013 
Deja vu - I can remember a time when our embassies were stormed under another failed President Obama=Carter 
I guess Obama's Cairo Speech really worked out The Muslim Brotherhood stormed our embassy on 9.11 Imagine if Obama speaks in Beijing 
   Those who refuse to draw red line to Iran don't have the moral right to put a red line to @Israel   -- @IsraeliPM @netanyahu

 As bad as they were 
 The Middle East is blowing up--we didn't back Egypt and now they riot against us Iran is using Iraqi airspace 
Obama is a disaster at foreign policy Never had the experience or knowledge He is not capable of doing the job 
Libya is selling its oil to China--I notice the Chinese Ambassador is very safe 
 I always said the people we fought for in Libya were bad news Once again 
 Obama doesn't know what he's doing His foreign policy is a disaster Libya 

We fight to free Libya and they kill our Ambassador and other Americans Obama's foreign policy is a joke

One of the best moves I ever made was staying out of last decade's artificial real estate boom But I used the downturn to my advantage 
 During @BarackObama's presidency 
 A lot of people strongly advised me against doing @ApprenticeNBC Next week we start filming the record 13th season 
Hence 
If @BarackObama had to use the same labor participation he had when he entered office then the unemployment number would be 11.2% 

 Unemployment rate only dropped because more people are out of labor force & have stopped looking for work.Not a real recovery 
 There are now 119 
 Today's job report is dismal Now a record 88

The Chinese are better off than they were 4 years ago They have stolen even more from us in jobs & trade during @BarackObama's term 

 NBC Wall St Journal Poll of African American voters: 94% @BarackObama

 My @foxandfriends interview discussing @newtgingrich's SC win 


Iran is threatening to shut the Strait of Hormuz and @BarackObama won't approve the Keystone pipeline His energy policy makes America weak

   While Obama is obsessed with   green collar jobs 
My @Newsmax_Media interview from Friday where I predicted that @newtgingrich in South Carolina would change the race.http://bit.ly/xoFMs6 
Congratulations to @newtgingrich on a stunning win in South Carolina All eyes are on Florida now 

When will we learn  
Canada will now sell its oil to China because @BarackObama rejected Keystone At least China knows a good deal when they see it 

 The White House should stop publicly pressuring Israel on Iran Iran's nuclear program is the threat 


The law requires individuals pay 15% on carried interest Why would a potential President pay more than he or she is supposed to 
The national debt continues to rise at record levels and today @BarackObama is in Disney World He lives in a fantasy

 My interview with @IngrahamAngle discussing the GOP primary 

The debate was great last night--- all performed well 



 While @BarackObama is slashing the military 
   For too long we've been pushed around 

   I love America And when you love something you protect it passionately--fiercely 
Our Marines are sent to kill the Taliban not coddle them USMC should be praised not investigated Semper Fi  
Newt attacks on @MittRomney record at Bain an attack on free enterprise and entrepreneurship Mistake 
An Iranian nuclear scientist's car exploded in Tehran yesterday--lots of problems to come--@BarackObama --we need real leadership 

 With unempoyment over 10% in 2009 



   A real president should take pride in saving and spending your money wisely 

OPEC has just raised oil to over $102/Barrel And @BarackObama still won't approve the Keystone Pipeline Does he want high gas prices 
 Why are we building a $1Billion embassy in Iraq when the country kicked us out 
3 Chief of Staffs in less than 3 years of being President: Part of the reason why @BarackObama can't manage to pass his agenda 
New Hampshire has a major decision to make today Hopefully we won't have to hear any more Mandarin spoken in future debates 
This is why @TimTebow is a winner He lays everything out on the field He never quits and never gives up That's why he is a success

 Michelle Obama likes to be addressed as   Your Excellency   

   Nobody cares   about the Iowa straw poll is what @JonHuntsman said yesterday His problem is that nobody cares about his campaign (or him)  

Michele Bachmann just dropped out of prez race--- when she didn't do the Newsmax debate it showed great disloyalty and people rejected her 
We left Iraq and it is quickly falling apart--what a waste of lives and money--and so obvious 
   If history teaches us anything 

   Under President @BarackObama 
He should be ignored: @RonPaul's foreign policy is a dream come true for our enemies He has zero chance to beat @BarackObama 
 Michele Bachmann got less than 1 
Congratulations to @RickSantorum for coming out of Iowa a winner 
It's no wonder @RickSantorum is surging in Iowa - he agreed to participate in the Newsmax-@iontv debate 
Another @BarackObama investment triumph--the $500Billion American funded Finnish plug in cars are all being recalledhttp://nyti.ms/sYzfMs

 The Washington Establishment will never rein in government spending 
When will the US government finally classify China as a currency manipulator China is robbing us blind and @BarackObama defends them 


I play golf to relax My company is in great shape @BarackObama plays golf to escape work while America goes down the drain 
NYC should hold a parade for returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans 

 I like Russell Brand 
America wasted billions and precious lives in Iraq and Iran will soon take control--very very sad 
 I'm right 

 I predicted the 9/11 attack on America in my book   The America We Deserve   and the collapse of Iraq in @TimeToGetTough  
Americans Elect on track to put an Indy Presidential candidate on the ballot in all 50 states 

   It's important that we help poor people to become independent 

The Fed's reckless monetary policies will cause problems in the years to come The Fed has to be reined in or we will soon be Greece 
What a convenient mistake: @BarackObama issued a statement for Kwanza but failed to issue one for Christmas.http://bit.ly/vUmvpM

The safest way to preserve Medicare is with a robust and vibrant economy We should lower corporate and capital gain taxes immediately 
 A week after Biden says that the Taliban is not our enemy 
 Even if @BarackObama stays in DC

My @FoxNews interview with @gretawire discussing how @BarackObama is delusional and how a 3rd party candidate can win.http://bit.ly/uGCgId  
Barney Frank looked disgusting--nipples protruding--in his blue shirt before Congress Very very disrespectful 

He is delusional: @BarackObama believes that he is the 4th best POTUS ever 
The WH yesterday defended Biden's comments that the Taliban aren't our enemy When did the American people decide this?http://fxn.ws/v93Olk  
   Obamacare has to be killed now before it grows into an even bigger mess 

I really enjoyed last night's Tele-Town Hall with @ralphreed's Faith and Freedom Coalition Thanks to the thousands who joined 
I still can't believe we didn't t take the oil from Iraq 

 For last minute shopping 
 The average family has spent $4 
 Tom   marbles in his mouth   Brokaw once thanked me for the great success of the Apprentice for NBC Now 
Joe Biden said that the Taliban 'is not our enemy.' I wonder how our troops in Afghanistant that are under attack view Biden's statement 
What a shock The U.S Capitol Christmas tree pays homage @BarackObama but failed to mention Jesus 
He thinks that the wealth you create belongs to the gov't @BarackObama doesn't respect the fact that the money he wastes belongs to us 

   People who have the ability to work should But with the government happy to send checks 



   It's a plain fact: free trade requires having fair rules that apply to everyone   

   We need a tax system that is fair and smart--one that encourages growth 
China taxing imports from the US --22%-- why aren't we taxing China 
Dummies left Iraq without the oil--not believable 
Iraq in political turmoil one day after we leave---I told you so 
Even @BarackObama's former National Security Advisor Jim Jones has called the Keystone pipeline  'a national must.' America needs it 

Barney Frank admited that ObamaCare does have 'death panels' yesterday Obamacare must be fully repealed or healthcare will be destroyed 
 With a record deficit and $15 trillion in debt 
Our diplomats are weak: @JonHuntsman's China policy proves why we need businesmen to negotiate against China

Washington will continue to run record deficits into the election We are borrowing at a rate of $1.40 from China Truly unsustainable 
Iran will soon take all of the oil in Iraq...and Iraq itself---Keep the oil

 ObamaCare does indeed ration care Seniors are now restricted to   comfort care   instead of brain surgery Repeal now!http://bit.ly/spcorH

 As of September 30th 
 Yesterday @BarackObama actually spent a full day in Washington He didn't campaign 


Egypt is turning into a hot bed of radical Islam The current protest is another coup attempt  We should never have abandoned Mubarak 
The House's failure to pass the Balance Budget Amendment was another unforced error by the GOP Very disappointing 
 When the Super Committee fails 
 If @BarackObama wanted the   Super Committee   to succeed 

The Super Committee is finding ways to raise all our taxes without admitting it The Republicans made a big mistake agreeing to this deal 
ObamaCare is one of the greatest threats our country faces  It is unsustainable and will lead America into complete insolvency 
@TheDailyShow @Lawrence Panama is not a Trump development We only manage it after it is built They also licensed the name

The Fannie and Freddie execs should not get million dollar bonuses with our tax dollars They were bailed out with $169B of our money 

He is out of real solutions--@BarackObama's job bill is nothing more than a tax increase 
The @SuperCommittee will fail The Republicans never should have agreed to the debt deal 
 Instead of trash talking @PMIsrael on the world stage 
America should not be pressuring @Israel to show restraint against Iran We should be working to stop Iran's nuclear drive 
Some @OWS protesters are sincere people frustrated with the system--others just in for the party 
 Our deficits are caused by runaway spending 
The Federal government spent over $3.7 trillion last year This is unsustainable and a true danger The American dream is being destroyed

The economy won't fully recover until  @ObamaCare is fully repealed It is a job killer 
 Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood just made its first visit to Hamas-led Gaza Why did @BarackObama promote the   Arab Spring    

 The  @SuperCommittee must cut spending 
Another company that the DOE has given money to just filed for bankruptcy This is how the money we borrow at 40% from China is wasted 

The Republicans never should have agreed to this past summer's debt deal  Military cuts will now come along with tax increases

 I only go on shows that get ratings 


Libya is adopting a more radical form of Sharia Law now under their new leadership Is this what @BarackObama wanted 
 So much for creating American jobs--@BarackObama gave $529 Million to a   Green   car company---so they can be manufactured in Finland  
The job plan by @BarackObama is nothing more than a second stimulus The first failed and so will this one 

We are leaving Iraq after expending a tremendous amount of blood and treasure We should be reimbursed with oil -- Don't give it to Iran 
The Dollar is at an all-time WWII low against the Yen The Fed's recklessness is going to lead to record inflation

When will @BarackObama release an actual budget 
I don't want to be the only billionaire in America---I want all Americans to be rich 
If the Prez wants to create jobs talk to some business people---not liberal intellectuals 
The only way to spread economic growth is to lower taxes and end unfriendly regulatory practices 
The Fed's reckless monetary policy is going to create record inflation 
New study shows 80% of Congress have no business experience--it shows 
 A guy named @BobBeckel on FOX 
I have traveled the world America is the most beautiful country on Earth 
The only job @BarackObama cares about is his own Everything he does is for his own reelection 
When will we stop wasting our money on rebuilding Afghanistan We must rebuild our country first 
The GOP primary schedule is a disaster Not enough time 

@BarackObama is trying to pass another stimulus after the first was a complete failure Does he really believe we are that stupid 
Why is the UN condemning @Israel and doing nothing about Syria What a disgrace 
In order to save Medicare and stop record premium increases--we must repeal ObamaCare 
Washington is wasting over $2 billion this year on Solyndra type loans Yet they want to cut military spending 
China is threatening Washington over the currency bill  We should pass it immediately 
@BarackObama sold guns to the Mexican drug cartels  They were used in the murders of Americans  Where is the outrage 
 @BarackObama now says  that he is an   underdog in 2012   America should be so lucky We still need a solid candidate  
Our national debt has grown by 30% and a gallon of gas has doubled so far under @BarackObama He is a disaster 
The Democrats in the Super Committee want to raise taxes first in deficit talks Huge mistake Cut wasteful spending first 

Great meeting with @THEHermanCain yesterday in Trump Tower Great guy 
 Looking forward to visiting the Trump Vineyard Estates today in Charlottesville 

I was on  CNN last night with @ErinBurnett 
Watch my interview with Greta Van Susteren @Gretawire tonight at 10 p.m on Fox News 
It's about time Italy recognized the innocence of @AmandaKnox---great news 

 My book 
@THeCelebrityApprentice  cast is set---the best we've ever had Shooting starts in 2 weeks---airs  in February 
@USGovernment has done nothing to help @AmandaKnox 
@AmandaKnox is innocent  Italian government should pay for this travesty 
 Sadly 
The unemployment numbers are tragic We are letting the world take our jobs  It has to stop 
 @BarackObama said yesterday that we have   gone soft   How can the world respect us when our own President doesn't  
How many  more billions of dollars will @BarackObama continue to waste in these solar companies 
Everyone should boycott Italy if Amanda Knox is  not freed---she is totally innocent 
@JonHuntsman called to set up a meeting Haven't returned his call 
 @VPBiden is actually right for once:  Biden:   Voters should blame Obama 
My interview yesterday with @MyFoxNYhttp://bit.ly/qeXyIk  

 A simplified tax code would spur economic growth and help create jobs Unfortunately 
The only way for Medicare and Social Security to remain solvent is if our economy is healthy @BarackObama doesn't get it 
The Iranians have just threatened to send warships to our coasts They laugh at us We can't allow them to develop nuclear weapons 
The Fed's reckless policies of low interest and flooding the market with dollars needs to be stopped or we will face record inflation 
 China does not negotiate from a position of strength 
My @FoxNews interview from yesterday discussing my recent meetings in Trump Tower and also @GovChristiehttp://bit.ly/qMUUux  
Really bad ratings  for Lawrence O'Donnell on MSNBC---O'Reilly is killing him 
@JonHuntsman has zero chance of getting the nomination Whoever said I wanted to meet him Time is money and I don't waste mine 
The @erictrumpfdn Golf Invitational featuring a performance by @BretMichaels was a great event Enjoy the video....http://bit.ly/pFw6Pi  
When will @BarackObama present an actual budget Enough with the games 
   Sleepy   Chuck Todd of NBC falls far short of the late great Tim Russert  
China is stealing our jobs We need to demand China stop manipulating its currency and end its rampant corporate espionage 

ObamaCare must be completely repealed A recent report from UBS shows that it is the number one reason employers are not hiring 

Happy New Year to all my Jewish friends 

It seems @BarackObama had our tax dollars buy guns for Mexican drug lords that were used to kill Americans We need answers now 
A great interview of @DonaldJTrumpJr in the @ globeandmail on Trump Tower Torontohttp://bit.ly/pUhQ0S  

My @FoxNews interview from last night with @gretawire discussing yesterday's meeting with @MittRomneyhttp://bit.ly/qDvtU2  
 My @FoxNews interview from yesterday with @TeamCavuto discussing the economy 

Our country's debt crisis cannot be solved by tax increases We must cut government spending 
Obama Care’s taxes vest in 2014 Conveniently after the 2012 election Coincidence 

Our deficit spending is China’s gain @BarackObama is bankrupting our country 
I couldn't make the Faith and Freedom confab in Orlando so I sent a video...http://bit.ly/nV99vz  

 Government waste 
@EricTrump is doing a great job on completing our new Trump Winery in Virginia 
@BarackObama's Jobs Plan sure looks like a Tax Increase Plan to me 
Australia is a beautiful country with terrific people who love America 
China is neither an ally or a friend--they want to beat us and own our country 
Our next President must stop China's Rip-off of America 
 Just finished speaking in Sydney 
Rick Perry is right when he says we must stand by Israel in the UN 
ObamaCare will destroy small business--the backbone of America's economy 
   If you're going to think--think big   --- The Art of the Deal  
Sorry I will miss the CPAC gathering in Orlando--there in spirit--Obama must go 

I find it really hard to listen to @BarackObama's speeches He doesn't have a clue 
It  seems there is never a problem for which @BarackObama cannot find a reason for another speech and another tax 


How will raising taxes create jobs Washington is all out of answers New leadership is needed 
I am increasingly concerned with the UN's ploy against @Israel this coming week and will monitor all events closely from Australia 

If China had a tenth of the natural resources we do then they would already be energy independent Instead we continue to buy oil from OPEC 

   It  doesn't cost any money to think bigger    -- The Art of the Deal  
@BarackObama---great job on Solyndra You are some extremely skilled venture capitalist Stick to the memoirs and speeches 
@BarackObama -- honored and excited to be listed on @AttackWatch Thanks BTW -- where are the jobs   Donald 
I applaud @netanyahu for announcing that he will show up at the UN to defend @Israel A true US friend and great leader 
We can create jobs in the American economy by protecting our own manufacturing sector 
Can you imagine if @BarackObama had passed Cap and Trade  Energy costs would be double from already record highs 
The Solyndra Scandal--@BarackObama's $500Million photo op He loves wasting our money 

 Had dinner with @RickPerry last night---great guy 
Third Gun Linked to 'Fast and Furious' Identified at Border Agent's Murder Scene When will the White House come clean 
@BarackObama's job bill contains the word 'Tax' over 330 times--that will sure work 

 Bob Turner--great guy 
I'm looking forward to seeing you all this afternoon at Macy's Herald Square  5:30 pm at the Crystal department on 8 
@BarackObama will hear loud and clear today the message NY-9 is sending by electing @Bobturner9th -- @Israel is our friend and ally 


The White House is continuing to be openly uncooperative with the Fast and Furious investigation American lives were lost We need answers 

How can the economy ever recover when @BarackObama keeps threatening the private sector with more taxes This is no way to spur growth 
I'm urging my friends in Brooklyn to vote for Bob Turner tomorrow--send @barackobama a message 
 Friends in NY-9 
The American economy would grow if Washington didn’t keep threatening higher taxes and more regulations Government is not the solution 


The World Economic Forum now ranks the US the fifth most competitive economy in the world We have fallen from first under @BarackObama 
Iran’s nuclear program must be stopped – by any and all means necessary 
Very exciting I will be at Macy’s Herald Square this Wednesday at 5:30pm to celebrate the launch of Trump Home crystal 
Want jobs Slash corporate tax rate  Tax incentives for companies that create jobs in US  America will boom 
 @BarackObama---the stimulus will fail 
 I watched POTUS speech from Europe---same old   tax and spend   won't create jobs  
@IvankaTrump always makes me proudhttp://bit.ly/pWz8Xi  
Why is the UN planning to attack @Israel's sovereignty and ignore Iran's nuclear program The US should look at future funding 
China is happy to learn that @BarackObama plans to borrow another $300 Billion @BarackObama is their favorite client 
If only speeches could create jobs then @BarackObama wouldn't have such a dismal economic record 

My interview with @gretawire last night on @FoxNews:  @BarackObama 'Missed His Opportunity'http://bit.ly/oTjwin  
America needs a tough negotiator---not a community organizer 
Why was @BarackObama selling guns to Mexican drug dealers 
A robust growing economy is how to fix Social Security and Medicare---not cuts on Seniors 
 US should have told Libya   Rebels   --- give us 50% of your oil for our military support  

@BarackObama trillion $ stimulus was supposed to create jobs -- instead it gave us more debt and higher unemployment 

@BarackObama wishes speeches could create jobs  His job is costing America all of ours 
Fast and Furious   gun running goes all the way to the White House  We need answers now 
Oil is double the price now compared to last year--OPEC is laughing at @BarackObama 
Fast and Furious put semi-automatics in the hands of Mexican drug lords that killed Americans - @BarackObama should answer all questions 
The White House is predicting 9% unemployment throughout 2012 – and when Obama Care takes effect in 2014 expect it to go even higher 
Make no mistake---Fast and Furious goes ALL the way to the White House 
@BarackObama is so inept that I think he simply  made a mistake in originally scheduling the Joint Session on September 7th Just sad 

We must stand firm against the UN's ploy to sabotage Israel---if the UN grants the PA statehood then we must immediately defund it 
I'll be  on Greta Van Susteren's show tonight at 10 PM on FoxNews Tune in 
 With gas prices rising and the economy failing 
Libya is being taken over by Islamic radicals---with @BarackObama's open support 

China's business interests reach far and wide---even domestically within our borders We need to reassess our relationship 
The new Libyan Government should turn over the Lockerbie bomber---now 
ObamaCare must be fully repealed or it will destroy America's small businesses 
 If the UN unilaterally grants the Palestinians statehood 
If the Palestinians want statehood then why are they run by the terrorist group Hamas 
Crude is at $85 right now – isn’t even worth half that OPEC is ripping us off 
@BarackObama MUST release a budget before @johnboehner begins negotiations on a continuing appropriations resolution 

Libyan Rebels should have given us 50% of the oil in return for our military support---we don't even ask 

More and more Americans seem fed up with both Parties----I agree 
There is no substitute for private sector experience 
Why did @BarackObama and his family travel separately to Martha's Vineyard They love to extravagantly spend on the taxpayers' dime 
 I'm very proud of the work my son @EricTrump has been doing with the @EricTrumpFDN 
America needs a President who can negotiate better deals for the American People 
 China's corporate espionage is a continued threat to the American economy With the right leadership 
@BarackObama inherited $10.6 Trillion in National Debt---will leave after his first term with the Debt at over $17.6 Trillion 
 There usually is an easy solution to every problem For instance 
We have spent over $1 Billion on the  Libya operation What are we getting back 
 Just as I predicted 
As bad as Qaddafi was---what comes next in Libya will be worse---just watch 
Let's not start celebrating over Libya until we see who takes over 
We  spent over a billion on Libya and lead the way---why is Europe getting the oil 
@RonPaul has some serious ideas which deserve serious consideration Wrong for media to ignore him 
We don't need another stimulus The first one was a complete failure Why repeat the same mistake 
 While @BarackObama continues to defend ObamaCare in the courts 
Israel is being barraged by rockets from Gaza recently They must respond accordingly in defense of their citizens 
@BarackObama is sure a master delegator. He has sent @Joe_Biden to China. The Chinese are laughing at us We MUST do better 
@BarackObama’s new job plan will certainly do the following – 1 Not create any jobs 2 Borrow more money from China.  

Insurgents in Iraq show they can still mount horrifying attacks---US wastes  trillions 
 Many people have been asking to see my plane 
Karl Rove --lost GOP both Houses of Congress and the White House--gave us Obama 

Ron Paul is right when he says we are wasting lives and money in Iraq and Afghanistan 
My interview with @gretawire on Fox News for those who missed it - 'Obama's Constantly on Vacation'http://bit.ly/qR8arA  
@BarackObama has a record low 39% Gallup approval rating Why so high 

 Amazing--Obama speaks 



China is a threat to America They are not our friend 
Unemployment is plaguing both Black and Hispanic youths Very troubling 

@BarackObama played golf yesterday Now he  heads to a 10 day vacation in Martha's Vineyard  Nice work ethic 
Reporters say it's the Trump Bump---I tell CNBC I am buying stocks--- and the market goes up 
 Economic growth can save Social Security 
 Mike Huckebee 
Ron Paul is right that we are wasting trillions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan 
Obama has no understanding of how to create jobs or opportunity He believes in Government 
It's easy to see why Americans are sick of career politicians and both parties 
How will Mitt Romney defend his  record on jobs and Romneycare in tonight's debate 
Looking forward to the GOP  debate and the outcome of the Ames straw poll We must get a real leader 


The Fed continues to flood the market with US dollars Wrong move 
Oil is starting to rise again despite the horrible times OPEC continues to rip us off Not worth $30 New leadership needed 
 Congress should get back to Washington 






 My interview with Greta last night on Fox News --   Nation Has Become   All Talk 

his radio show @AmericaNowRadio with me tomorrow 6PM EThttp://goo.gl/AMNEE   
The S&P downgrade is a direct result of @BarackObama's increased reckless budget spending and Obama Care He owns this 
 The new President of OPEC is Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s confidant Rostam Ghasemi 
Obama Care is already having a devastating impact on our economy 


America's debt officially became 100% of our GDP on @BarackObama's 50th birthday---coincidence 

Thanks to Giovanni's Coal Fire Pizza of Florida for donating enough pizza to feed 750 Police Athletic League youngsters in NY this Friday 
 Watch my interview with Greta Van Susteren on her show 

Morning Joe Panel is stealing many of  my statements and ideas to better America without giving credit -- the story of my life 
Republicans gave Obama a free pass to the White House -- they just don't get it 
I believe America can be great only with proper leadership 
Wake Up America -- China is eating our lunch 
All those politicians in Washington and not one good negotiator 

No taxes the only good thing about DC Debt Deal 



 The more you learn about the debt deal 

Republicans and Democrats have both created our economic problems 
Why should we have any defense cuts in any deal America must remain strong 
This is the best deal the Republicans could get 
Disappointed in GOP and Dems---Giving Obama power to raise the debt limit next year is  a mistake 
Ex-Presidential Pollster Pat Cadell says most voters sick of both parties and their failure 
We need economic growth and jobs not blue ribbon panels to study the problem 
No taxes in Boehner or Reid Plan----important victory for America 
Watched Sean Hannity last night -- a great guy 
 If Obama has to re-fight this fight next year he loses  --   Watch the fine details in every deal   -- The Art of the Deal  
Blue Ribbon Commission to find and agree to future spending cuts Bad idea 
   Never quit and always hit back   -- The Art of the Comeback  
 I just got Mike Leach's new book 
 I appreciate the kind words of Mike Huckabee 
 @BarackObama has not released his own debt plan yet He's totally lost 
 My wife Melania Trump's show was a tremendous success last night In case you missed her 
 @Johnboehner    The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it    --The Art of the Deal  

 @KarlRove's @CrossroadsGPS new ad criticizes Obama for his excessive spending and debt 
 My interview yesterday from Newsmax -   Obama Is  'Now Totally Lost 
People ask me every day to pose for pictures but the camera never works the first time--they are never prepared or maybe just very nervous 
   Know when to walk away from the table     The Art of the Deal  
Watch my wife Melania Trump tonight on @QVC at 1 a.m  So proud of her 
Higher Taxes kill job creation---cut wild government spending and waste 
China has so much of our debt that they can't put us in default w/o killing themselves---US needs our toughest negotiator---and fast 
America's debt is greater than our GDP Time for new thinking 


Fiscal mismanagement of cash costing US Taxpayer billions---cut fraud and waste before cutting funding for Seniors 
 Obama 

The Answer to both Social Security and Medicare is a robust growing economy---not cuts on the elderly 
We need a balanced budget Amendment because Congress has no fiscal discipline 
Unfortunately@BarackObama's continued attack on the US $ will lead to ever rising gas prices at the pump and lots of other really bad things 
 Ronald Kessler's new book   The Secrets of the FBI   is a great book that should be read by everyone  
   Increasing America’s debt weakens us domestically and internationally   - US Senator @BarackObama 

   The Gang of Six   - yet another unmitigated disaster ANY DEAL NEEDS TO REPEAL OBAMACARE T-E-A  
   China is our enemy--they want to destroy us   -- Redstate Interview  
Obama is addicted to spending America into insolvency His record proves it 
Robust Economic growth is the answer to the Medicare Problem--not cuts on the elderly 
 While @BarackObama seeks to further destroy  our credit 
 @johnboehner  @EricCantor    You can't con people...if you don't deliver the goods 
So China is ordering us to raise the Debt Limit...How low have we as a nation sunk 
The GOP doesn't waste  an opportunity to waste an opportunity Defunding Obamacare should be central to any deal 
Every dollar @BarackObama spends costs $1.40 with interest borrowed from China on our children and grandchildren's backs CUT-CAP-BALANCE 
@BarackObama has sold guns to Mexican drug lords while his DOJ erodes our 2nd  Amendment rights 

Congratulations to my daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared on the birth of  their daughter Arabella Rose yesterday 
 @marcorubio is right We need to create more taxpayers 
@BarackObama You have increased discretionary spending by 25% annually and amassed over $4 trillion in debt T-E-Ahttp://on.wsj.com/onsY3b  

 What is better advice-   The Art of the Deal   or   Rules for Radicals   I know which one @BarackObama prefers  
 CUT 

US News named the Top10 best hotels in the US--and Trump Int'l Hotel & Tower NYC and Trump Int'l Hotel & Tower Chicago are on the list 
 @BarackObama You have abandoned Israel and engaged the Muslim Brotherhood 

My interview last night with Greta on the GOP going El Foldohttp://bit.ly/oprTzh  
 @johnboehner Debt Ceiling-   Sometimes no deal is better than a bad deal    

 @macmiller   Donald Trump the Song   gets 16M hits on YouTube Who wouldn't be flattered  
 @johnboehner   Much as it pays to emphasize the positive 
 @johnboehner Mr Speaker 


 House GOP wants to cut Medicare 


 @johnboehner Message for House GOP    The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it   - The Art of the Deal  
If only @Obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening Israel's borders then America would be on the path to solvency 
 THe Art of the Deal--  The best thing you can do is deal from strength 
 Republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @BarackObama in today's debt talks--First and foremost CUT 
 Congress is back.TIME TO CUT 
Perhaps this is the kind of thinking we need in Washington ...http://on.wsj.com/ldLEoy
