nielson media research final numbers on acceptance speech: trump 32.2 million. clinton 27.8 million. thank you 

can you imagine if i had the small crowds that hillary is drawing today in pennsylvania. it would be a major media event @cnn @foxnews 
nato commander agrees members should pay up via @dcexaminer: ://www.washingtonexaminer.com/nato commander agrees members should pay up/article/2598183?custom_click=rss … 
wow, nato's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must pay their bills. this is a general i will like 
the rust belt was created by politicians like the clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like mexico. end 
crooked's stop in johnstown, pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 with bill, vp 

word is that crooked hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in pennsylvania. perhaps it is because her husband signed nafta? 
i turned down a meeting with charles and david koch. much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better 
why doesn't the media want to report that on the two big thursdays when crooked hillary and i made our speeches republican's won ratings 

crooked hillary clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. a formula for disaster 
violent crime is rising across the united states, yet the dnc convention ignored it. crime reduction will be one of my top priorities. 
just got back from colorado. the love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. big crowds

american homeownership rate in q2 2016 was 62.9% lowest rate in 51yrs. we will bring back the 'american dream 'pic.twitter.com/yi4q8fhrjp 
we are suffering through the worst long term unemployment in the last 70 years. i want change crooked hillary clinton does not. 
hillary can never win over bernie supporters. her foreign wars, nafta/tpp support & wall street ties are driving away millions of votes. 
colorado was amazing yesterday so much support. our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to colorado and the whole country. 


as usual, hillary & the dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major nfl games. same as last time w/ bernie. unacceptable 

hillary clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts. 


only a reagan or a trump like figure in the white house will achieve this goal. ://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/29/we need a tough negotiator like trump to fix us trade policy commentary.html …

what bernie sanders really thinks of crooked hillary clinton.pic.twitter.com/vgmaaszbep 
i am watching crooked hillary speak. same old stuff, our country needs change 
wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more bernie supporters that they will never support crooked hillary. she sold them out, v.p. pick 

the dishonest media didn't mention that bernie sanders was very angry looking during crooked's speech. he wishes he didn't make that deal 
thank you facebook: ://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/posts/10157391232965725:0 … instagram: ://instagram.com/p/bic8oz2dcco/ pic.twitter.com/pw7gs8r9gg 
crooked hillary said that i couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign. really,i just beat 16 people and am beating her 

little michael bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. his last term as mayor was a disaster 

crooked hillary clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. many of her statements were lies and fabrications

two policemen just shot in san diego, one dead. it is only getting worse. people want law and order 
crooked hillary clinton made up facts about me, and forgot to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream 
the media coverage this morning of the very average clinton speech and convention is a joke. @cnn and the little watched @morning_joe = sad 
no one has worse judgement than hillary clinton corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes. 
hillary's wars in the middle east have unleashed destruction, terrorism and isis across the world. 
hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety. 
hillary will never reform wall street. she is owned by wall street 
our way of life is under threat by radical islam and hillary clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words. 
hillary's refusal to mention radical islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country. 


dems warn not to underestimate trump's potential win ://nypost.com/2016/07/25/dems warn not to underestimate trumps potential to win/ … 

median household income is down for the middle class since obama took office. it will only go further down under clinton. 
a vote for clinton kaine is a vote for tpp, nafta, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees.

our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair.

not one american flag on the massive stage at the democratic national convention until people started complaining then a small one. pathetic 
our not very bright vice president, joe biden, just stated that i wanted to carpet bomb the enemy. sorry joe, that was ted cruz 
crooked hillary clinton wants to flood our country with syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. the danger is massive. no 
hopefully the violent and vicious killing by isis of a beloved french priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. get tough 
the democratic convention has paid zero respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. no recognition sad 
funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing dems narrative that russia is working for me because putin said trump is a genius. america 1st 
as i have been saying, crooked hillary will approve the job killing tpp after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv. 
just like i have warned from the beginning, crooked hillary clinton will betray you on the tpp. ://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/terry mcauliffe hillary clinton tpp trade 226253 … 
many of bernie's supporters have left the arena. did bernie go home and go to sleep? 
i hate to say it, but the republican convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the democratic convention 
no matter what bill clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. highly overrated 
you have no idea what my strategy on isis is, and neither does isis (a good thing). please get your facts straight thanks. @megynkelly 
for the record, i have zero investments in russia. 
in order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the wikileakes disaster, the dems said maybe it is russia dealing with trump. crazy 

dems don't want to talk isis b/c hillary's foreign interventions unleashed isis & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here. 
bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed 
the invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for crooked hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar 



pocahontas bombed last night sad to watch. 
why aren't the democrats speaking about isis, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. the republican convention was great 
funny, if you listen to @foxnews, the democrats did not have a good day. if you listen to the other two, they are fawning. what a difference 
bernie sanders totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton. all of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it waste of time. 
elizabeth warren, often referred to as pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about crooked hillary, who she always hated 
sad to watch bernie sanders abandon his revolution. we welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs. 
if cory booker is the future of the democratic party, they have no future i know more about cory than he knows about himself. 
i was at @foxnews and met juan williams in passing. he asked if he could have pictures taken with me. i said fine. he then trashes on air 
hard to believe that bernie sanders has done such a complete fold. he got nothing for all of the time, energy and money. the v.p. a joke 
while bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers. 
clinton betrayed bernie voters. kaine supports tpp, is in pocket of wall street, and backed iraq war. 





the state of florida is so embarrassed by the antics of crooked hillary clinton and debbie wasserman schultz that they will vote for change 
wow, the republican convention went so smoothly compared to the dems total mess. but fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn 
here we go again with another clinton scandal, and e mails yet (can you believe). crooked hillary knew the fix was in, b never had a chance 
crooked hillary clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the dnc they just got caught, that's all they laughed at bernie. 
if bernie sanders, after seeing the just released e mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same. 

hillary was involved in the e mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened 
how much bad judgement was on display by the people in dnc in writing those really dumb e mails, using even religion, against bernie 
the new joke in town is that russia leaked the disastrous dnc e mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because putin likes me 
watched crooked hillary clinton and tim kaine on 60 minutes. no way they are going to fix america's problems. isis & all others laughing 
the ratings for the republican national convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. thank you 
the highly neurotic debbie wasserman schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a crooked hillary victory, she's out 
the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing e mails say the rigged system is alive & well 
even though bernie sanders has lost his energy and his strength, i don't believe that his supporters will let crooked hillary off the hook 
crooked hillary clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, dws. too bad bernie flamed out 
if the republican convention had blown up with e mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (bernie), media would go wild 
the @cnn panels are so one sided, almost all against trump. @foxnews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. don't watch cnn 
i always said that debbie wasserman schultz was overrated. the dems convention is cracking up and bernie is exhausted, no energy left 
today proves what i have always known, that @reince priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not debbie wasserman shultz (@dwstweets.) 
sorry folks, but bernie sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. he is trying to dismiss the new e mails and dnc disrespect. sad 
there is no longer a bernie sanders political revolution. he is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end 
an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates. 
looks like the bernie people will fight. if not, their blood, sweat and tears was a total waste of time. kaine stands for opposite 
wow, president obama's brother, malik, just announced that he is voting for me. was probably treated badly by president like everybody else 
bernie sanders started off strong, but with the selection of kaine for v.p., is ending really weak. so much for a movement total disrespect 
the crooked hillary v.p. choice is very disrespectful to bernie sanders and all of his supporters. just another case of bad judgement by h 

@nancynielsenn: @realdonaldtrump dinesh d'sousa hillary's america. see it 

thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on thursday night. from the heart 
the wikileaks e mail release today was so bad to sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud 
just saw crooked hillary and tim kaine together. isis and our other enemies are drooling. they don't look presidential to me 
i will bring jobs back and get wages up. people haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. clinton killed jobs 
tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. job killer 
funny that the democrats would have their convention in pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. i will bring jobs back 
crooked hillary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pennsylvania. against steelworkers and miners. husband signed nafta. 
leaked e mails of dnc show plans to destroy bernie sanders. mock his heritage and much more. on line from wikileakes, really vicious. rigged 
pocahontas wanted v.p. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the senate. also, crooked hillary hates her 
tim kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. bernie fought for nothing 
the bernie sanders supporters are furious with the choice of tim kaine, who represents the opposite of what bernie stands for. philly fight? 

i highly recommend the just out book the field of fight by general michael flynn. how to defeat radical islam. 
is it the same kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while governor of virginia and didn't get indicted while bob m did? 
another attack, this time in germany. many killed. god bless the people of munich. 
one of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions. great unity big t.v. ratings @karlrove 
thank you cleveland. we love you and will be back many times 
what a great four days in cleveland. so proud of the great job done by the rnc and all. the police and secret service were fantastic 





other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is very united. great love in the arena 
ted cruz talks about the constitution but doesn't say that if the dems win the presidency, the new justices appointed will destroy us all 
i am soooo proud of my children, don, eric and tiffany their speeches, under enormous pressure, were incredible. ivanka intros me tonight 


arena was packed, totally electric 
.@mike_pence was fantastic tonight. will be a great v.p. 

wow, ted cruz got booed off the stage, didn't honor the pledge i saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. no big deal 


thank you to governor @scottwalker for such warm support. great speech 



john kasich was never asked by me to be v.p. just arrived in cleveland will be a great two days 
statement on melania speech ://www.donaldjtrump.com/press releases/statement on melania trump speech1 … 
the media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of melania's speech than the fbi spent on hillary's emails. 
good news is melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press 
in november, i think the people of ohio will remember that the republicans picked cleveland instead of going to another state. jobs 
bill hemmer of @foxnews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. more than in past years. 
congratulations to my children, don and tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. i am very proud of you 
such a great honor to be the republican nominee for president of the united states. i will work hard and never let you down america first 
the roll call is beginning at the republican national convention. very exciting 


@roxanetancredi: democrats are coming to trump. i used to be proud of the dem party. no more it is crooked and not for the people. 



networks other than low ratings @cnn have been very fair and exciting 
.@cnn is the worst.they go to their dumb, one sided panels when a podium speaker is for trump vast majority want: make america great again 
looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife, melania. place looks beautiful 

president obama just had a news conference, but he doesn't have a clue. our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse 
our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. we are not looking good, we are not looking smart, we are not looking tough 

i will be on @60minutes tonight at 7:00 p.m. with mike pence talking about law and order and many other subjects bad times for divided usa 
we are trying to fight isis, and now our own people are killing our police. our country is divided and out of control. the world is watching 
we grieve for the officers killed in baton rouge today. how many law enforcement and people have to... ://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/posts/10157324504140725 … 
the ratings at @foxnews blow away the ratings of @cnn not even close. that's because cnn is the clinton news network and people don't like 
.@foxnews is much better, and far more truthful, than @cnn, which is all negative. guests are stacked for crooked hillary i don't watch. 
if goofy elizabeth warren, a very weak senator, didn't lie about her heritage (being native american) she would be nothing today. pick her h 
i hope that crooked hillary picks goofy elizabeth warren, sometimes referred to as pocahontas, as her v.p. then we can litigate her fraud 
it doesn't matter that crooked hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. bernie said she has bad judgement 
as the days and weeks go by, we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in crooked hillary clinton led obama into bad decisions 
we are going to have a great time in cleveland. will lead to special results for our country. we will make america great again 
goofy elizabeth warren, who may be the least productive senator in the u.s. senate, must prove she is not a fraud. without the con it's over 
thank you to jack morgan, tamara neo, cheryl ann kraft and all of my friends and supporters in virginia. great job

crooked hillary clinton is bought and paid for by wall street, lobbyists and special interests. she will sell our country down the tubes 
very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, crooked hillary clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money 
crooked hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e mail lies, has been a disaster on foreign policy. look what's happening 
crooked hillary is spending big wall street money on ads saying i don't have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have done 
look forward to introducing governor mike pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great state of indiana). my first choice from start 
look forward to governor mike pence v.p. introduction tomorrow in new york city. 
i am pleased to announce that i have chosen governor mike pence as my vice presidential running mate. news conference tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. 
four more years of weakness with a crooked hillary administration is not acceptable. look what has happened to the world with o & hillary 

my prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in nice, france. we are with you in every way 
in light of the horrible attack in nice, france, i have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my vice presidential announcement. 
another horrific attack, this time in nice, france. many dead and injured. when will we learn? it is only getting worse. 
i employ many people in the state of virginia jobs, jobs, jobs crooked hillary will sell us out, just like her husband did with nafta. 


i will be making the announcement of my vice presidential pick on friday at 11am in manhattan. details to follow. 
if i win the presidency, we will swamp justice ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions 
even the @nytimes and @washingtonpost editorial boards condemned justice ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. what was she thinking? 
is supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? big mistake by an incompetent judge 
on my way to san diego to raise money for the republican party. i am spending a lot myself and also helping others. 
voters understand that crooked hillary's negative ads are not true just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity. 

lyin' crooked hillary's email stories all have one thing in common.pic.twitter.com/teovcyxkor 
is president obama trying to destroy israel with all his bad moves? think about it and let me know 
the republican platform is most pro israel of all time 
new gop platform now includes language that supports the border wall. we will build the wall and make america safe again 



justice ginsburg of the u.s. supreme court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. her mind is shot resign 


i will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @foxnews at 8pm. enjoy 

to all the bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests, we welcome you with open arms. people first. 
bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro war pro tpp pro wall street crooked hillary clinton. 
bernie sanders endorsing crooked hillary clinton is like occupy wall street endorsing goldman sachs. 

i am somewhat surprised that bernie sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. they are not happy that he is selling out 
bernie sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton. he will endorse her today fans angry 

for too many years, our inner cities have been left behind. i am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need. 
crime is out of control, and rapidly getting worse. look what is going on in chicago and our inner cities. not good

the media is so dishonest. if i make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.they think the public is stupid 
president obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. he is living in a world of the make believe 
look what is happening to our country under the weak leadership of obama and people like crooked hillary clinton. we are a divided nation

i have over seven million hits on social media re crooked hillary clinton. check it out sleepy eyes, @markhalperin @nbcpolitics 
sleepy eyes chuck todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.he could not have watched my standing ovation speech in n.c. 
even the once great caesars is bankrupt in a.c. others to follow. ask the democrat city council what happened to atlantic city. 
hillary clinton should ask why the democrat pols in atlantic city made all the wrong moves convention center, airport and destroyed city 
i made a lot of money in atlantic city and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies. 
crooked hillary clinton lied to the fbi and to the people of our country. she is sooooo guilty. but watch, her time will come 
the rigged system may have helped hillary clinton escape criminal charges, but... ://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/videos/10157263351880725/ …pic.twitter.com/8cbsfnpl2l 
crooked hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement. 
crooked hillary clinton and her team were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. not fit 
crooked hillary clinton is unfit to serve as president of the u.s. her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. bad judgement 
i don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed crooked hillary to get away with murder. come november 8, she's out 
raised a lot of money for the republican party. there will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. lots of support win 
i will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @foxnews at 11pm. enjoy 
my son, @erictrump will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10pm on @foxnews. enjoy 
looking forward to meeting with @senbobcorker in a little while. we will be traveling to north carolina together today. 

the system is rigged. general petraeus got in trouble for far less. very very unfair as usual, bad judgment. 
it was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. she has done a fantastic job for the people of iowa and u.s. will see her again 
taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of air force one on the campaign trail by president obama and crooked hillary. a total disgrace 
on @foxnews at 7:00 p.m. special: meet the trumps hope you enjoy 
why is president obama allowed to use air force one on the campaign trail with crooked hillary? she is flying with him tomorrow. who pays? 
with hillary and obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is radical islam 
crooked hillary clinton is guilty as hell but the system is totally rigged and corrupt where are the 33,000 missing e mails? 
the only people who are not interested in being the v.p. pick are the people who have not been asked 
i look forward to meeting @joniernst today in new jersey. she has done a great job as senator of iowa 
spent time with indiana governor mike pence and family yesterday. very impressed, great people 
senator tom cotton was great on meet the press yesterday. despite a totally one sided interview by chuck todd, the end result was solid 
dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the star of david rather than a sheriff's star, or plain star 

crooked hillary will never be able to handle the complexities and danger of isis it will just go on forever. we need change 
the third mass attack (slaughter) in days by isis. 200 dead in baghdad, worst in many years. we do not have leadership that can stop this 
in bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by isis terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the koran. 20 were killed 
i believe that crooked hillary sent bill to have the meeting with the u.s.a.g. so bill is not in trouble with h except that he got caught 
the secret meeting between bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. in back of closed plane was heightened with fbi shouting go away, no pictures. 
does anybody really believe that bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. talked only about grandkids and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac? 
the system is rigged 
on saturday a great man, elie wiesel, passed away.the world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil 
crooked hillary clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the u.s.a.g. to work out a deal. the system is totally rigged & corrupt 
only a fool would believe that the meeting between bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. was not arranged or that crooked hillary did not know. 
just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me chuck todd, and the entire show, is against me.the good news the people get it 
it was just announced by sources that no charges will be brought against crooked hillary clinton. like i said, the system is totally rigged 
it is impossible for the fbi not to recommend criminal charges against hillary clinton. what she did was wrong what bill did was stupid 







the speakers slots at the republican convention are totally filled, with a long waiting list of those that want to speak wednesday release 
just read in the failing @nytimes that i was not aware the event had to be held in cleveland a total lie. these people are sick

.@traceadkins great job on fox this morning. keep up the good work 
take a look at what happened w/ bill clinton. the system is totally rigged. does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence? 
bill clinton's meeting was a total secret. nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter. 
as bernie sanders said, hillary clinton has bad judgement. bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by hillary 

i will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10pm on fox enjoy 
the reason i put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, i want to make america great again 
i have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. i have totally terminated the loan 
the very dishonest @nbcnews refuses to accept the fact that i have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. done deal 
one of the reasons hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich selling out america. ://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/u/us_clinton_emails?site=ap&section=home&template=default&ctime=2016 06 29 17 38 07 …

the story with hillary will never change. ://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the fix/wp/2016/06/28/hillary clintons email story continues to get harder and harder to believe/ … 
for reasons only they can explain, the @uschamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better. 
tremendous day in massachusetts and maine. thank you to everyone for making it so special 
@gengm7: @jakeda @realdonaldtrump as of april this year, hillary had spent $264,000,000 on her campaign mr.trump $55,000,000. self funding 
i will be on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 p.m. enjoy 
isis exploded on hillary clinton's watch she's done nothing about it and never will. not capable 
will be in bangor, maine today join me 4pme at the cross insurance center ://www.donaldjtrump.com/schedule/register/bangor me/ …pic.twitter.com/7lapewxe05 

just watched senator john barrasso on @foxnews he was great thank you john. 
why would the uschamber be upset by the fact that i want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that i want penalties for cheaters? 
the @uschamber must fight harder for the american worker. china, and many others, are taking advantage of u.s. with our terrible trade pacts 
iron mike tyson was not asked to speak at the convention though i'm sure he would do a good job if he was. the media makes everything up 
@jtsbk: @allenwest thanks for sharing eric we need @realdonaldtrump now as this administration is incapable of keeping our country safe 
we must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the united states. 
yet another terrorist attack, this time in turkey. will the world ever realize what is going on? so sad. 
hillary clinton’s presidency would be catastrophic for the future of our country. she is ill fit with bad judgment. 
benghazi is just another hillary clinton failure. it just never seems to work the way it's supposed to with clinton. 

@kridan1: canceled cable sick of their bad coverage of you and the fawning over clinton ... listened to your great speech on youtube 


@patricia_graf: @govbrewer @cvpayne let's get trump supporters out in massive numbers and make america great again create jobs 

@govbrewer: i'll be a guest today on making money with @cvpayne on @ fox business 6 pm et / 3 pm pt discussing @realdonaldtrump. tune in 
.@cnn is all negative when it comes to me. i don't watch it anymore. 
the media is unrelenting. they will only go with and report a story in a negative light. i called brexit (hillary was wrong), watch november 
crooked hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the u.s. senate, goofy elizabeth warren, who lied on heritage. 


@brazosboys: hillary read sigh off the teleprompter, she's so fake she has to be told how to feel: ://youtu.be/iyuqtxxzpsk  @foxnews 

the dirty poll done by @abc @washingtonpost is a disgrace. even they admit that many more democrats were polled. other polls were good. 
crooked hillary attacks foreign government donations while ignoring her own: ://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/posts/10157225458500725:0 … 
crooked hillary clinton got brexit wrong. i said leave will win. she has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. only a question of time 
hillary clinton is not a change agent, just the same old status quo she is spending a fortune, i am spending very little. close in polls 
people in our country want borders, and without them the old line pols like crooked hillary will not win. it is time for change and jobs 
top 50 facts about crooked hillary clinton from trump 'stakes of the election' address: ://assets.donaldjtrump.com/clintonfacts.pdf … 
the @abc poll sample is heavy on democrats. very dishonest why would they do that? other polls good 
crooked hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at turnberry. shows me hitting shot, but i never did = lie was there to support son 
clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on brexit with big dollar ads. disgraceful 
crooked hillary clinton, who called brexit 100% wrong (along with obama), is now spending wall street money on an ad on my correct call. 
george will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the republican party.he's made many bad calls 
just landed in new york a one night stay in scotland. turnberry came out magnificently. my son, eric, did a great job under budget 
obama has blocked ice officers and bp from doing their jobs. that ends when i am president 
i have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' but we must enforce the laws of the land 

we must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.

so funny, crooked hillary called brexit so incorrectly, and now she says that she is the one to deal with the u.k. all talk, no action 

@jolena3: @realdonaldtrump and we will get it back once we have president trump can't wait 
@darrenwaggener: @realdonaldtrump what has happened in the uk in the last 12 hours is exactly what will happen in november..vote trump 2016 
many people are equating brexit, and what is going on in great britain, with what is happening in the u.s. people want their country back 
the opening of trump turnberry in scotland was a big success. good timing, i was here for brexit. very exciting news conference today 
crooked hillary called it totally wrong on brexit she went with obama and now she is saying we need her to lead. she would be a disaster

our inner cities have been left behind. we will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border. 
on immigration, i’m consulting with our immigration officers & our wage earners. hillary clinton is consulting with wall street. 
obama & clinton should stop meeting with special interests, & start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration. 

sc has kept us safe from exec amnesty for now. but hillary has pledged to expand it, taking jobs from hispanic & african american workers. 

isis threatens us today because of the decisions hillary clinton has made along with president obama. donald j. trump 
hillary clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. donald j. trump 
thank you to donald rumsfeld for the endorsement. very much appreciated. clinton's conduct has been disqualifying.

@chrisboydbrew: @loudobbs @realdonaldtrump @foxbusiness.. saw your interview.you are the best great questions, great answers lou is great 
crooked hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief she will be a disaster for jobs and the economy 
i will be interviewed by @loudobbs tonight on @foxbusiness 7pm et 
hillary defrauded america as secy of state. she used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich corrupt, dangerous, dishonest. 
if you want to know about hillary clinton's honesty & judgment, ask the family of ambassador stevens. 
hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays. 
i am the king of debt. that has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. i made a fortune off of debt, will fix u.s. 
obama clinton inherited $10t in debt and turned it into nearly $20t. they have bankrupted… ://www.instagram.com/p/bg7iyzumhzw/  
hillary clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all americans and make everyone less safe. 
how can hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk? 
hillary clinton surged the trade deficit with china 40% as secretary of state, costing americans millions of jobs. 
hillary says this election is about judgment. she's right. her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed isis and wrecked the economy. 
i will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of crooked hillary clinton. 
crooked hillary clinton is totally unfit to be our president really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess 
when i said that if, within the orlando club, you had some people with guns, i was obviously talking about additional guards or employees 
.@djohnsonpga we are so proud of you dustin. your reaction under pressure was amazing. first of many majors. you are a true champion

i will be going to new hampshire today, home of my first primary victory, to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday. 2:30 p.m. 
i have been hitting obama and crooked hillary hard on not using the term radical islamic terror. hillary just broke said she would now use 
what has happened in orlando is just the beginning. our leadership is weak and ineffective. i called it and asked for the ban. must be tough 
@wandawalls20: @realdonaldtrump please make us safe. we cannot have hillary as president. we will be in so much trouble. 
reporting that orlando killer shouted allah hu akbar as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in la with rifles near gay parade. 
is president obama going to finally mention the words radical islamic terrorism? if he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace 
appreciate the congrats for being right on radical islamic terrorism, i don't want congrats, i want toughness & vigilance. we must be smart 
horrific incident in fl. praying for all the victims & their families. when will this stop? when will we get tough, smart & vigilant? 
clinton made a false ad about me where i was imitating a reporter groveling after he changed his story. i would never mock disabled. shame 
really bad shooting in orlando. police investigating possible terrorism. many people dead and wounded.

a massive blow to obama's message only 38,000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. that's really bad 
crooked hillary is being badly criticized (for a wall street paid for ad) by politifact for a false ad on me on women. she is a total fraud 
crooked hillary clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions 

people like @katyturnbc report on my campaign, but have zero access. they say what they want without any knowledge.true of so much of media 
hillary clinton is unfit to be president. she has bad judgement, poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. change 
i am watching @cnn very little lately because they are so biased against me. shows are predictable garbage cnn and msm is one big lie

crooked hillary no longer has credibility too much failure in office. people will not allow another four years of incompetence 
crooked hillary clinton, who i would love to call lyin' hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions.

even though i have a very biased and unfair judge in the trump u civil case in san diego, i have thousands of great reviews & will win case

congratulations to @seanhannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings. speaking of ratings i will be on his show tonight @ 10pe. 
i am getting great credit for my press conference today. crooked hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days. 
katie couric, the third rate reporter, who has been largely forgotten, should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc. 
i will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10pme on @foxnews. enjoy 

so many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money i raised/gave it was my great honor they do an amazing job. 
just finished a press conference in trump tower wherein i gave information on which veterans groups got the $5,600,000 that i raised/gave 
i have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great veterans, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. watch 
so many great things happening new poll numbers looking good news conference at 11:00 a.m. today, trump tower 
i should have easily won the trump university case on summary judgement but have a judge, gonzalo curiel, who is totally biased against me. 
i have a judge in the trump university civil case, gonzalo curiel (san diego), who is very unfair. an obama pick. totally biased hates trump 
i hope everyone had a great memorial day 
i would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than crooked hillary) if i only had one opponent, instead of sixteen. broke record 
have a great memorial day and remember that we will soon make america great again 

@frankylamouche: how many of donald's rolling thunder brigade will sign up and go to war for him in the middle east. 

@scottwrasmussen: donald trump and bikers share affection at rolling thunder rally ://nyti.ms/1nxyk1v  a great day in d.c. 

the endorsement of me by the 16,500 border patrol agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. nice 
in getting the endorsement of the 16,500 border patrol agents (thank you), the statement was made that the wall was very necessary 
obama says a wall at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at w.h. 
if dummy bill kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an independent, say good bye to the supreme court 
the republican party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in november. can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler indie candidate 
bill kristol has been wrong for 2yrs an embarrassed loser, but if the gop can't control their own, then they are not a party. be tough, r's 
good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics b/c i stand 100% behind everything we do. 
heading to d.c. to see and hear rolling thunder. amazing people that love our country. great spirit 
honor memorial day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country we love them. 

don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. the only quote that matters is a quote from me 
i am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes, but when i won the gop nomination, i'm in the back of the paper. very dishonest 
the media is on a new phony kick about my management style. i spend much less money & get much better results what we need as prez 
the failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style & that i don't have many people. i have 73, hillary has 800 & i'm beating her. 
i (we) broke the all time record for most votes gotten in a republican primary by a lot and with many states left to go thank you. 
the u.s. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. how nice, but what do we get? not enough

i find it offensive that goofy elizabeth warren, sometimes referred to as pocahontas, pretended to be native american to get in harvard. 

.@kimguilfoyle just watched you on @outnumberedfnc thank you 
the inspector general's report on crooked hillary clinton is a disaster. such bad judgement and temperament cannot be allowed in the w.h. 

thank you washington honored to say, on behalf of our great movement, we have broken the all time record for votes in gop primary history. 
the protesters in new mexico were thugs who were flying the mexican flag. the rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals 
crooked hillary clinton just can't close the deal with bernie. i had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. hillary doesn't have it 
goofy senator elizabeth warren @elizabethforma has done less in the u.s. senate than practically any other senator. all talk, no action 
@elizabethforma goofy elizabeth warren, sometimes known as pocahontas, bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing. total hypocrite 
@gordonsr1052: washington, big thank you for supporting trump we are all going to help trump make america great again trump2016 
@buiidthewall: @realdonaldtrump high energy 
@pipersul: great speech tonight mr.trump good luck in california thank you. 
@deepaks76435750: @realdonaldtrump congratulations from india 


@tcloer11: @realdonaldtrump great job make america great again 
@elizabethforma goofy elizabeth warren, sometimes referred to as pocahontas because she faked the fact she is native american, is a lowlife 
great rally in new mexico, amazing crowd now in l.a. big rally in anaheim. 


after raising, w/ no obligation, almost $6m for vets, i couldn't believe protesters formed @ trump tower. just out sent by crooked hillary 
thank you @dailymail for setting the failing @nytimes story straight. this is what the nyt's should have written ://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article 3607052/the sexist boss trump critic barbara res really thought turned donald got rid refused hire back.html …

a great new book has been written about crooked hillary. read it & you will never be able to vote for her. @ed_klein ://www.amazon.com/unlikeable problem hillary edward klein/dp/1621573788 … 
crooked hillary clinton overregulates, overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement 
i just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the f.e.c. even the dishonest media thinks great 
amazingly, with all of the money i have raised for the vets, i have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media. 
much of the money i have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups. 
while under no obligation to do so, i have raised between 5 & 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our veterans. nice

obama’s va secretary just said we shouldn't measure wait times. hillary says va problems are not ‘widespread.’ i will take care of our vets 
is hillary really protecting women? ://www.instagram.com/p/bfwtioighqj/  
in trade, military and everything else, it will be america first this will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: make america great again 

the american people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists 
bernie sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that crooked hillary clinton will be forced out of the race e mail scandal 

crooked hillary wants a radical 500% increase in syrian refugees. we can’t allow this. time to get smart and protect america 
how can crooked hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical islam, which horribly oppresses women? 
why do the networks continue to put dopey @billkristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs? 
hillary clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad would be four more years of stupidity 
crooked hillary said that i want guns brought into the school classroom. wrong 
@dubilujane: i trust @realdonaldtrump more anyone ever to protect america.he will do the right thing for the u.s.a, without a doubt. 

crooked hillary clintons foreign interventions unleashed isis in syria, iraq and libya. she is reckless and dangerous 

.@cnn is so negative, getting even worse as i get closer. just had two anti trump losers with zero rebuttal from my team. turning off 

crooked hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. no more guns to protect hillary 
while our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the tsa is falling apart, just like our government airports a total disaster 
crooked hillary is spending tremendous amounts of wall street money on false ads against me. she is a very dishonest person 
crooked hillary clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. no gun owner can ever vote for clinton 
thank you @thetodaysgolfer for the wonderful statement that the new par 3 9th hole @trump turnberry could be the most dramatic in britain. 
@montgomeriefdn colin, great to have you at trump turnberry. so proud of you and your great playing you made winning majors look easy 




failing @nytimes will always take a good story about me and make it bad. every article is unfair and biased. very sad 
thanks @piersmorgan trump is the most unpredictable, extraordinary, entertaining&massively popular candidate this country has ever seen.

crooked hillary can't even close the deal with bernie and the dems have it rigged in favor of hillary. four more years of this? no way 
crooked hillary clinton looks presidential? i don't think so four more years of obama and our country will never come back. isis laughs 
look where the world is today, a total mess, and isis is still running around wild. i can fix it fast, hillary has no chance 
crooked hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. isis, china, russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years 
i said that crooked hillary clinton is not qualified to be president because she has very bad judgement bernie said the same thing 
thank you @ltstevenlrogers. we will respond to terrorism with strength in 2017 ://amp.twimg.com/v/55610e7e e370 4f5e a031 0098a264184d …

looks like yet another terrorist attack. airplane departed from paris. when will we get tough, smart and vigilant? great hate and sickness 
my list of potential u.s. supreme court justices was very well recieved. during the next number of weeks i may be adding to the list 
some low life journalist claims that i made a pass at her 29 years ago. never happened like the @nytimes story which has become a joke 



why did clinton supporter @alisonforky declare crooked hillary winner in ky when ap hasn't even called the race? 
bernie sanders is being treated very badly by the democrats the system is rigged against him. many of his disenfranchised fans are for me 
paul begala, the dopey @cnn flunky and head of the pro hillary clinton super pac, has knowingly committed fraud in his first ad against me. 
@shoneep: @realdonaldtrump trump for president bernie is a joke, knows nothing and hillary is yesterday's and today's nightmare 

congratulations to the movement, we have just won the great state of oregon. the vote percentage is even higher than anticipated thank you. 


@sandrajeanne48: no way i believe trump at 70% disapproval with women. went to 3 rallies. at least 1/2 women. msm lies @thefive 
michael barbaro, the author of the now discredited @nytimes hit piece on me with women, has in past tweeted badly about me. he should resign 
@michael_favreau: @jis3 @realdonaldtrump he will destroy hillary but why give cnn record breaking ratings cnn can go to hell. trump 2016 
i look so forward to debating crooked hillary clinton democrat primaries are rigged, e mail investigation is rigged so time to get it on 
i can't believe that @cnn would allow the very nice jeffrey lord to be savaged by a panel of seven trump haters. 7 to 1 don't watch cnn 
@cowboysfortrump: @christichat @rockprincess818 @realdonaldtrump that man is a pillar of strength and will be perfect as our next president 
well, that is it. well done megyn and they all lived happily ever after now let us all see how the movement does in oregon tonight

@xgodfatherxzx: @realdonaldtrump amazing on megan kelly thanks. 
@trumptrainrider: .@realdonaldtrump watching you on fox with @megynkelly now. can't wait to hear what you two talked about. 
i will be live tweeting @megynkelly show in 10 minutes. should be interesting. will be on fox network enjoy 
wall street paid for ad is a fraud, just like crooked hillary their main line had nothing to do with women, and they knew it. apologize? 
do you think crooked hillary will finally close the deal? if she can't win kentucky, she should drop out of race. system rigged 

i look forward to watching @megynkelly tonight, 8 pm et. it will be interesting to see how she treats me—i think she will be very fair. 
how can crooked hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for nafta, the worst economic deal in u.s. history? 
crooked hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.if so, he should run,not her.will he bring the energizer to d.c.? 

crooked hillary can't close the deal with bernie sanders. will be another bad day for her 
amazing that crooked hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the worst abuser of woman in u.s. political history 
oregon is voting today. keep the big numbers going vote trump make america great again 
crooked hillary clinton put out an ad where i am misquoted on women. can't believe she would misrepresent the facts my hit was on china 
the pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. you can tell them to go blank themselves was about china, not women 
wow, 30,000 e mails were deleted by crooked hillary clinton. she said they had to do with a wedding reception. liar how can she run? 

what barbara res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly, and for years, trying to come back. i said no. 
i gave a woman named barbara res a top n.y. construction job, when that was unheard of, and now she is nasty. so much for a nice thank you 
in politics, and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. this is a primary reason that president obama is the worst president in u.s. history 
the writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes, michael barbaro, who was interviewed on cbs this morning, was unable to respond. 
over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6. that’s because there were so many positive statements. 
no wonder the @nytimes is failing—who can believe what they write after the false, malicious & libelous story they did on me. 
the failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women. 
rowanne brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday joined @foxandfriends. ://amp.twimg.com/v/ebf3185d 9258 407b a53a a92289f9e7fb …

with the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me, we have exposed the article as a fraud 
a political commentator for @cnn, which i no longer watch, said trump showed some weakness in the repub primaries. i set all time record 
wow, rowanne brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday, was on @foxandfriends saying times lied 
the @nytimes is so dishonest. their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by rowanne brewer, who said it was a lie 
that was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends i hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is 
bernie sanders is being treated very badly by the dems. the system is rigged against him. he should run as an independent run bernie, run. 

the @washingtonpost report on potential vp candidates is wrong. marco rubio and most others mentioned are not under consideration. 

the media is really on a witch hunt against me. false reporting, and plenty of it but we will prevail 
why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that i was so proud to have helped with their careers. dishonest 
wow, i have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece. massive front page for that 
why doesn't the failing @nytimes write the real story on the clintons and women? the media is totally dishonest 

@tzard000: @realdonaldtrump @nytimes everyone continues to pile onto donald, but they can never take away our votes thank you 
everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.i gave them many names of women i helped refused to use 

@mrtohney: leicester & donaldtrump seem to have the same trajectory, both were written off, but they keep scaling the heights. history? 
@queencharlotteo: @realdonaldtrump @nytimes i'm a women & i 100% support @realdonaldtrump & i have since the beginning. thank you 
the failing @nytimes wrote yet another hit piece on me. all are impressed with how nicely i have treated women, they found nothing. a joke

if it were up to goofy elizabeth warren, we’d have no jobs in america—she doesn’t have a clue. 
in interview i told @ap that my taxes are under routine audit and i would release my tax returns when audit is complete, not after election 
isn’t it funny when a failed senator like goofy elizabeth warren can spend a whole day tweeting about trump & gets nothing done in senate? 
goofy elizabeth warren lied when she says i want to abolish the federal minimum wage. see media—asking for increase 
our native american senator, goofy elizabeth warren, couldn’t care less about the american worker…does nothing to help 
goofy elizabeth warren is now using the woman’s card like her friend crooked hillary. see her dumb tweet “when a woman stands up to you…” 
if the people of massachusetts found out what an ineffective senator goofy elizabeth warren has been, she would lose 
thanks piers. ://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/730465526993039360 … 

goofy elizabeth warren didn’t have the guts to run for potus. her phony native american heritage stops that and vp cold. 
goofy elizabeth warren has been one of the least effective senators in the entire u.s. senate. she has done nothing 
i don't want to hit crazy bernie sanders too hard yet because i love watching what he is doing to crooked hillary. his time will come 
big wins in west virginia and nebraska. get ready for november crooked hillary, who is looking very bad against crazy bernie, will lose 


the clintons spend millions on negative ads on me & i can’t tell the truth about her husband? don’t feel sorry for crooked hillary

i will have set the all time record in primary votes in the republican party despite having to compete against 17 other people 
if i only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like hillary clinton, i would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did 
crooked hillary clinton says that she got more primary votes than donald trump. but i had 17 people to beat—she had one

goofy elizabeth warren is weak and ineffective. does nothing. all talk, no action maybe her native american name? 
goofy elizabeth warren and her phony native american heritage are on a twitter rant. she is too easy i'm driving her nuts. 
crooked hillary clinton wants completely open borders. millions of democrats will run from her over this and support me. 
just met with courageous family of sarah root in nebraska. sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy. 
goofy elizabeth warren, hillary clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. she is not native american. 
let’s properly check goofy elizabeth warren’s records to see if she is native american. i say she’s a fraud 
i hope corrupt hillary clinton chooses goofy elizabeth warren as her running mate. i will defeat them both. 
response to @lindseygrahamsc: ://bit.ly/1qujcfygrahamresponse … 
i hear @joenbc of rapidly fading @morning_joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. this will guarantee a crooked hillary win. 
joe scarborough initially endorsed jeb bush and jeb crashed, then john kasich and that didn't work. not much power or insight 
thank you to teachers across america when i become potus we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now. 
crooked hillary has zero leadership ability. as bernie sanders says, she has bad judgement. constantly playing the women's card it is sad 
paul ryan said that i inherited something very special, the republican party. wrong, i didn't inherit it, i won it with millions of voters 

so many great endorsements yesterday, except for paul ryan we must put america first and make america great again 
governor rick perry said donald trump is one of the most talented people running for the presidency i've ever seen. thank you rick 
unlike crooked hillary clinton, who wants to destroy all miners, i want wages to go up in america. we will do so by bringing back jobs 

can you believe crooked hillary said, we are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&coal companies out of business. she then apologized. 

bernie sanders has been treated terribly by the democrats—both with delegates & otherwise. he should show them, & run as an independent. 

i will be interviewed by @bretbaier @specialreport at 6pm et tonight @foxnews

what a great evening we had. so interesting that sanders beat crooked hillary. the dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him 
.@oreillyfactor please correct, i won virginia 
thank you indiana, we were just projected to be the winner. we have won in every category. you are very special people i will never forget 

lyin' ted cruz consistently said that he will, and must, win indiana. if he doesn't he should drop out of the race stop wasting time & money 
wow, lyin' ted cruz really went wacko today. made all sorts of crazy charges. can't function under pressure not very presidential. sad 







will be in south bend, indiana in a short while big rally see you soon 





i will be campaigning in indiana all day. things are looking great, and the support of bobby knight has been so amazing. today will be fun 
everybody is talking about the protesters burning the american flags and proudly waving mexican flags. i want america first so do voters 
gov mike pence has just stated that donald trump has taken a strong stance on hoosier jobs, and he thanks me i will bring back jobs to usa. 
crooked hillary clinton said she is used to dealing with men who get off the reservation. actually, she has done poorly with such men 
i will be interviewed on @cnn @newday at 7:30 a.m. enjoy 



.@karlrove is a failed jeb bushy. never says anything good & never will, even after i beat hillary. shouldn't be on the air 

will be in terre haute, indiana in a short while big rally see you soon 
i watched sen. graham @facethenation. why don't they say that i ran him out of the race like a little boy, and in the end he had no support? 

i will be in indiana on sunday and monday at four make america great again rallies. see you there 
thank you @mikeozanian for the nice comments on @foxnews today. great job 

the economy is bad and getting worse almost zero growth this quarter. nobody can beat me on the economy (and jobs). make america great again 

the protesters in california were thugs and criminals. many are professionals. they should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement 
.@ac360 anderson, so amazing. your mother is, and always has been, an incredible woman 
we are now at 1001 delegates. we will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged 

crooked hillary clinton, perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency, is also one of the all time great enablers 
wow, the ridiculous deal made between lyin'ted cruz and 1 for 42 john kasich has just blown up. what a dumb deal dead on arrival

so many false and phony t.v. commercials being broadcast in indiana. reminds me of florida where thousands were put up i won in a landslide 
i will be in evansville, indiana, with the great bobby knight (who last night endorsed me) at 12:00 this afternoon. see you there 
lyin' ted cruz, who can never beat hillary clinton and has no path to victory, has chosen a v.p.candidate who failed badly in her own effort 
i will be interviewed on the @todayshow at 7:00 a.m. this morning. enjoy 
thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech. i will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics 
@annettejeanne: i cried when they said you made a clean sweep of all 5 states. i was so happy i really adore you mr. trump, so much. 
getting the strong endorsement of the great coach, bobby knight, has been a highlight of my stay in indiana. big speech tomorrow with bobby 
i am in indiana where we just had a great rally. fantastic people staying at a holiday inn express new and clean, not bad

bernie sanders has been treated terribly by the democrats—both with delegates & otherwise. he should show them, and run as an independent 

make america great again ://bit.ly/1vzidekvotetrump …pic.twitter.com/2xwn52iph2 
the cruz kasich pact is under great strain. this joke of a deal is falling apart, not being honored and almost dead. very dumb 





on the way to the great state of rhode island big rally. then to pennsylvania for rest of day and night 
kasich just announced that he wants the people of indiana to vote for him. typical politician can't make a deal work. 
shows how weak and desperate lyin' ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses. 
lyin' ted cruz and 1 for 38 kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. shows weakness 
lyin' ted and kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. sad 
wow, just announced that lyin' ted and kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the republican nomination. desperation 
i am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. it is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. becoming irrelevant 
@diamondandsilk: .@donaldjtrumpjr awesome job on @cnnsotu. donaldtrump has integrity & he refuses 2 play the game call delegate bribery 

i will be in maryland this afternoon for a major rally. things are looking good for tuesday 
.@andrebauer great job and advice on @cnn @jaketapper thank you 
.@borisep was great on @judgejeanine tonight. very smart commentary that will prove to be correct 
as soon as john kasich is hit with negative ads, he will drop like a rock in the polls against crooked hillary clinton. i will win 
i had a great day campaigning in connecticut. looking for a big vote on tuesday 
congratulations to @seanhannity on his great ratings and ratings increase as reported by the @ap today. amazing job 






will be spending the day campaigning in connecticut, another state where jobs are being stolen by other countries. i will stop this fast 





i met prince on numerous occasions. he was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. he will be greatly missed 
cruz said kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. now he can't get to 1237. drop out lyin' ted. 
both ted cruz and john kasich have no path to victory. they should both drop out of the race so that the republican party can unify 
senator ted cruz has been mathematically eliminated from race. he said kasich should get out for same reason. i think both should get out 
i will be doing the @todayshow with my wife, melania, and the rest of my family in a major town hall. hopefully, it will be fun enjoy.7a.m. 

we are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to indiana 




ted cruz is mathematically out of winning the race. now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do. i will beat hillary

i am on @foxandfriends at 7:00 a.m. enjoy 


lyin’ ted cruz even voted against superstorm sandy aid and september 11th help. so many new yorkers devastated. cruz hates new york 
new york, we will make america great again ://www.instagram.com/p/bewcfr7mhxe/  
kasich only looks o.k. in polls against hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed zero negative ads against him 
lyin' ted cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses i am millions of votes ahead hillary would destroy him & k 
@diamondandsilk: .@realdonaldtrump is who we need 2 fix this corrupted, rigged system. 4 no profit, under budget & ahead of schedule. 


i would have millions of votes more than hillary except for the fact that i had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named bernie 
crooked hillary clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. i am the one person she doesn't want to run against. will be such fun 
lyin' ted cruz can't get votes (i am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the republican bosses. it won't work 
lyin' ted cruz will never be able to beat hillary. despite a rigged delegate system, i am hundreds of delegates ahead of him. 
i'll be in one of my favorite places this morning, staten island. big crowd, will be fun 





@ashleyedam: new cbs poll shows defections from cruz's core supporters & increased support for @realdonaldtrump ...not surprising.

the people of colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. biggest story in politics. this will not be allowed 
how is it possible that the people of the great state of colorado never got to vote in the republican primary? great anger totally unfair 

i win a state in votes and then get non representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by cruz campaign. bad system 
the @nytimes purposely covers me so inaccurately. i want other nations to pay the u.s. for our defense of them. we are the suckers no more

wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade, but if i win, all of the bad things happening in the u.s. will be rapidly reversed 
i will be in wisconsin until the election. jobs, trade and immigration will be big factors. i will bring jobs back home make great deals 
if @megynkelly stopped covering me on her show, her ratings would drop like a rock my h to h interview with @ac360 beat her by millions

why is this reporter touching me as i leave news conference? what is in her hand??pic.twitter.com/hqb8dl0fhn 
this was the reporters statement when she found out there was tape from my facility, she changed her tune.pic.twitter.com/n5815rs1at 
victory press conference was over. why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? can i press charges?pic.twitter.com/qbw2rjkinx 
why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape? 
wow, corey lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. look at tapes nothing there 
how come the @todayshow & @chucktodd show the new @nbcnews poll for hillary vs bernie but do not show the same poll where i am killing cruz? 
i have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than cruz or kasich, and yet am not being treated properly by the republican party or the rnc. 
wow, @cnn has nothing but my opponents on their shows. really one sided and unfair reporting. maybe i shouldn't do their town hall tonight 
we need to secure our borders asap. no games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant. make america great again & make america strong again 
lyin' ted, i have already beaten you in all debates, and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. you should focus on jobs & illegal imm 
lyin'ted cruz is weak & losing big, so now he wants to debate again. but, according to drudge,time and on line polls, i have won all debates 
after the way i beat gov. scott walker (and jeb, rand, marco and all others) in the presidential primaries, no way he would ever endorse me 
@pauladuvall2: cruz will say anything that is contrary to what you have to say. if you're for motherhood, he'll be against it 
just released that international gangs are all over our cities. this will end when i am president 
@wolfblitzer: campaign to date popular gop totals: @realdonaldtrump 7,546,980; @tedcruz 5,481,737; @johnkasich 2,724,749 a big difference

@nellalda: @realdonaldtrump we stand by trump 100% thank you 
i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30. things are looking good, had a great easter look forward to spending the week in wisconsin 

the united states cannot continue to make such bad, one sided trade deals. there are only so many jobs we can give up. no more 

just to show you how unfair republican primary politics can be, i won the state of louisiana and get less delegates than cruz lawsuit coming 
why can't the pundits be honest? hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. i will make it strong and great jobs 
another radical islamic attack, this time in pakistan, targeting christian women & children. at least 67 dead,400 injured. i alone can solve 
happy easter to all, have a great day 
my statement on nato being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the u.s. are now, finally, receiving plaudits 
wow, sleepy eyes @chucktodd is at it again. he is do totally biased. the things i am saying are correct. far better vision than the others 
i am interviewed on this week on @abc this morning. enjoy 
remember, i am the only candidate who is self funding. while i am given little credit for this by the voters, i am not bought like others 
don't believe the @foxnews polls, they are just another phony hit job on me. i will beat hillary clinton easily in the general election. 
wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in u.s., jobs are leaving. i will make our economy strong again bring in jobs 
nobody will protect our nation like donald j. trump. our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. illegals out 
lyin' ted cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with the national enq.were caused by me. i had nothing to do with story 
the press is going out of their way to convince people that i do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite 
the media is so after me on women wow, this is a tough business. nobody has more respect for women than donald trump 

@tytan01: dear @cnn, after doing a quick google & twitter search there are over 15,000 women's groups supporting donaldtrump. stop lying. 

@stancoltrane: turns out @glennbeck was wrong. @realdonaldtrump had nothing to do with it ://tinyurl.com/zlgr58e  
@theageofleo: your instincts on foreign policy & terrorism have been better than all of these so called experienced politicians combined. 
top suspect in paris massacre, salah abdeslam, who also knew of the brussels attack, is no longer talking. weak leaders, ridiculous laws 

wow, just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. how am i still number one by a lot? 
i didn't start the fight with lyin'ted cruz over the gq cover pic of melania, he did. he knew the pac was putting it out hence, lyin' ted 
just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the trump u case but the press refuses to write about it. if i lost monster story 

endorsements for lyin' ted cruz ://www.instagram.com/p/bdv28yimhqp/  

europe and the u.s. must immediately stop taking in people from syria. this will be the destruction of civilization as we know it so sad 
just announced that as many as 5000 isis fighters have infiltrated europe. also, many in u.s. i told you so i alone can fix this problem 
@doctor_s_freud: @theview they're all brain dead puppets with skeletons in their closet. i say you go on and destroy them all a dead show 
explain how the women on the view, which is a total disaster since the great barbara walters left, ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time 
.@theview t.v. show, which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air, is constantly asking me to go on. i tell them no 
hillary clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. time for a change, i will solve and fast 

it is amazing how often i am right, only to be criticized by the media. illegal immigration, take the oil, build the wall, muslims, nato 
remember when i recently said that brussels is a hell hole and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. i was so right 
these politicians like cruz and graham, who have watched isis and many other problems develop for years, do nothing to make things better 
.@lindseygrahamsc and lyin' ted cruz are two politicians who are very much alike all talk and no action both talk about isis, do nothing 
it is amazing how @lindseygrahamsc gets on so many t.v. shows talking negatively about me when i beat him so badly (zero) in his pres run 
@missi51: .@realdonaldtrump thank god is not a politician, but he's one heck of a fighter who will fight for us, the people. 
we pay a disproportionate share of the cost of n.a.t.o. why? it is time to renegotiate, and the time is now 
n.a.t.o. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on 

@kj11100me: @realdonaldtrump donald trump will be greater president than ragan. trump will set the button for morality,christianity. 
@tcsorr: @jphilman0206 @realdonaldtrump self funded and media loves him. not beholden to masters like @tedcruz. who owns ted? 

make america great again 
i want to thank @realsheriffjoe for all of his help in our historic arizona win. could not have done it without you joe 
while i believe i will clinch before cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race 
i think having jeb's endorsement hurts lyin' ted. jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing. i spent a fraction of that and am first 
i will be the best by far in fighting terror. i’m the only one that was right from the beginning, & now lyin’ ted & others are copying me. 
just watched hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. she’s been in office fighting terror for 20 years and look where we are 
low energy jeb bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, lyin’ ted cruz. honestly, i can’t blame jeb in that i drove him into oblivion 
lyin’ ted cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from michael douglas— just another dishonest politician. 

lyin' ted cruz denied that he had anything to do with the g.q. model photo post of melania. that's why we call him lyin' ted 
hopefully the republican party can come together and have a big win in november, paving the way for many great supreme court justices 
much bigger win than anticipated in arizona. thank you, i will never forget 

incompetent hillary, despite the horrible attack in brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open and let the muslims flow in. no way 
lyin' ted cruz just used a picture of melania from a g.q. shoot in his ad. be careful, lyin' ted, or i will spill the beans on your wife 

obama, and all others, have been so weak, and so politically correct, that terror groups are forming and getting stronger shame. 




watch this clip from earlier this year. time & time again i have been right about terrorism. it’s time to get tough ://www.instagram.com/p/bdqvbinghwm/  
i have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody and it’s not even close. hopefully az and ut will be voting for me today 
make america great again 
president obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in cuba, especially in the shadows of brussels. he is being treated badly 
do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place brussels was. not anymore, it is from a different world u.s. must be vigilant and smart 

@barrong510: @realdonaldtrump the media is corrupt we the people are fighting with you. 
wow, president obama just landed in cuba, a big deal, and raul castro wasn't even there to greet him. he greeted pope and others. no respect 
big republican dinner tonight at mar a lago in palm beach. i will be there 
@gamzorz: @megynkelly dont worry trump, they are losing thousands of viewers and money. roger ailes will be telling megyn to stop 
so the highly overrated anchor, @megynkelly, is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show, but i can't fight back? wrong 
the protesters blocked a major highway yesterday, delaying entry to my rally in arizona by hours, and the media blames my supporters 
why is it that the horrendous protesters, who scream, curse punch, shut down roads/doors during my rallies, are never blamed by media? sad 
will be interviewed on @thisweekabc this morning. enjoy 
@gstephanopoulos: what’s @realdonaldtrump's strategy to secure the gop nomination? i’ll talk to the republican front runner. @thisweekabc. 
the rallies in utah and arizona were great tremendous crowds and spirit. just returned but will be going back soon. 
@jojo2foxy: trump is not afraid of anything or anyone that's the president usa needs to unite us & knock the socks off our enemies 






wow, @cnn ratings are up 75% because it's all trump, all the time. the networks are making a fortune off of me make america great again 

if crazy @megynkelly didn't cover me so much on her terrible show, her ratings would totally tank. she is so average in so many ways 
crazy @megynkelly says i don't (won't) go on her show and she still gets good ratings. but almost all of her shows are negative hits on me 

@teamtrumpaz: check out hannity exclusive event with trump in phoenix, az ://www.eventbrite.com/e/hannity exclusive event with trump in phoenix az tickets 23244843954?utm medium=discovery&utm campaign=social&utm content=attendeeshare&aff=estw&utm source=tw&utm term=listing … @eventbrite 

@ma1973sk: actually, no @foxnews, @megynkelly has a sick obsession with trump. every day, every show, trashing, negative, hate. 




@cmichaeld2004: realistic trump poll numbers translate to the 70 percentile range in a two man race. gee, what happened to that 30% ceiling 
@ileanabarkus: @nytdavidbrooks i totally agree @nytdavidbrooks is strictly conceptual and theoretical and has no commonsense 


reading @nytdavidbrooks of the ny times is a total waste of time, he is a clown with no awareness of the world around him dummy 
while i have never met @nytdavidbrooks of the ny times, i consider him one of the dumbest of all pundits he has no sense of the real world 

watching @loudobbsnews fantastic show has very interesting take on paul ryan. 
just leaving salt lake city, utah fantastic crowd with no interruptions. love utah will be back 
why haven't they released the final missouri victory for us yet? could it be because cruz's guy runs missouri? 

do you believe that hillary clinton now wants obamacare for illegal immigrants? she should spend more time taking care of our great vets 
everybody should boycott the @megynkelly show. never worth watching. always a hit on trump she is sick, & the most overrated person on tv. 


mitt romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. no wonder he lost 
failed presidential candidate mitt romney was campaigning with john kasich & marco rubio, and now he is endorsing ted cruz. 1/2 
failed presidential candidate mitt romney, the man who choked and let us all down, is now endorsing lyin' ted cruz. this is good for me 
going to salt lake city, utah, for a big rally. lyin' ted cruz should not be allowed to win there mormons don't like liars i beat hillary 

club for growth tried to extort $1,000,000 from me. when i said no, they went hostile with negative ads. disgraceful 
with millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment, my numbers continue to go up. can anyone explain this? 
.@ewerickson got fired like a dog from redstate and now he is the one leading opposition against me. 
senator @lindseygrahamsc made horrible statements about @sentedcruz – and then he endorsed him. no wonder nobody trusts politicians 
lyin' ted cruz lost all five races on tuesday and he was just given the jinx a lindsey graham endorsement. also backed jeb. lindsey got 0 

hillary clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life 
make america great again 
who should star in a reboot of liar liar hillary clinton or ted cruz? let me know. ://www.instagram.com/p/bdehpegmhrv/  
highly overrated & crazy @megynkelly is always complaining about trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. focus on others megyn 
looking like my 5 victories on tuesday will be just as good as if i won ohio. two more days and ohio was mine 
see you in arizona on friday and saturday. ://twitter.com/foxbusiness/status/710488907121438720 … 
please explain to the dummies at the @wsj editorial board that i love to debate and have won, according to drudge etc., all 11 of them 
.@wsj is bad at math. the good news is, nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore, especially me 
.@wsj editorial says clinton primary vote total is 8,646,551.trump's is 7,533,692 a knock. but she had only 3 opponents i had 16.apologize 
the reason lyin' ted cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars a big problem 
crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.tough 
great news that @foxnews has cancelled the additional debate. how many times can the same people ask the same question? i beat cruz debating 
crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lyin' ted cruz on her show last night. ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. ted can't win 
stuart stevens, the failed campaign manager of mitt romney's historic loss, is now telling the republican party what to do with trump. sad 
i will be interviewed on the o'reilly factor this evening at 8 pm on the fox news channel. @oreillyfactor 

wow, just won missouri 
i am making a big speech the night of the @foxnews debate, but i wish everyone well. yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins 
thank you to the governor of florida, rick scott, for your endorsement. i greatly appreciate your support 
in the last 2 weeks, i had $35m of negative ads against me in florida & i won in a massive landslide.the establishment should save their $$ 
yesterday was amazing—5 victories. lyin’ ted cruz had zero. things are going very well 
is this what we want for a president? ://www.instagram.com/p/bdbs8byghwr/  
.@reptommarino great job on television this morning. glad to have you on my side 
@foxbusiness: .@reptommarino: i think @realdonaldtrump can beat hillaryclinton. and i'm looking forward to trump being president. 
.@pastormarkburns you were great last night and we all very much appreciate it thank you 
i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:30 a.m. enjoy

@lucyric13835428: @realdonaldtrump @megynkelly that's funny, i switched to other media too, can't stand her 


i only wish my wonderful daughter tiffany could have been with us at mar a lago for our great election victory. she is a winner 


watching other networks and local news. really good night crazy @megynkelly is unwatchable. 


can't watch crazy megyn anymore. talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race. with two people, big & over 
@dumpfoxnews: @foxnews @megynkelly if media wasn't so biased against trump, he would've won all of the delegates. 
@scnak45: @megynkelly is trying so hard to bash @realdonaldtrump it's ridiculous don't worry, everyone is wise to crazy megyn 

@jsconlon11: @bertshad @foxnews @megynkelly i tried to give them a shot tonight, but they have the whole anti trump cheerleading team. 
@gregens21: @bertshad @foxnews @megynkelly she's choking on the results call her justifiable kelly. justifying everything she says. 

word is that, despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads, i had a massive victory in florida. numbers out soon 
a lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in florida? hope this is false. 
i will bring our jobs back to the u.s., and keep our companies from leaving. nobody else can do it. our economy will sing again. 
in presidential voting so far, john kasich is zero for 22. so why would he be a good candidate? hillary would beat him, i will beat hillary 
ohio is losing jobs to mexico, now losing ford (and many others). kasich is weak on illegal immigration. we need strong borders now 
watching john kasich being interviewed acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. remember him in second debate, until i put him down. 

north carolina lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs and ohio lost 400,000 since 2000. going to mexico etc. no more if i win, we will bring back 


don't reward mitt romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for kasich (who voted for nafta, open borders etc.). 
please remember, i am the only candidate who is self funding his campaign. kasich, rubio and cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists 
i will bring our jobs back to america, fix our military and take care of our vets, end common core and obamacare, protect 2nd a, build wall 
rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the u.s. senate in many years. he will never make america great again 
kasich voted for nafta, a disaster for ohio, and now wants the even worse tpp approved. vote trump and end this madness 

@wh: ://youtu.be/i6ptmgsakno  wow people are so misinformed on donaldtrump character watch this video hillary and bernie don't come close 
@realwwshelton: @loudobbsnews i believe that @realdonaldtrump will be the big winner tomorrow. thank you 
@brazielcarol: @foxnews @realdonaldtrump who started this mess, the protesters of course . and media made it worse. 



gov kasich voted for nafta, which devastated ohio and is now pushing tpp hard bad for american workers 

look forward to being in tampa this afternoon. wonderful crowds. thank you, florida 


lyin' tedpic.twitter.com/q0qxdgcn1l 
the failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers. they knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. really bad people 
because gov. kasich cannot run in the state of pennsylvania he cannot win the nomination & should not be allowed to compete in ohio on tue. 

thank you kevin. with unification of the party, republican wins will be massive ://www.sacbee.com/news/politics government/capitol alert/article65283612.html … 
gov.kasich of ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television, he only watches the @golfchannel 
ohio gov.kasich voted for nafta, from which ohio has never recovered. now he wants tpp, which will be even worse. ohio steel and coal dying 
bernie sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. be careful bernie, or my supporters will go to yours 
@alextrent4: it is repulsive that trump was assaulted politicians used that 2 further themselves 2 further victimize trump disgusting 
wow, kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of pennsylvania, not enough signatures. big problem 
usss did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. he has ties to isis. should be in jail ://amp.twimg.com/v/977860d3 6b1b 4a5f a81e 67baa6e2e3b1 …?ssr=true 
do the people of ohio know that john kasich is strongly in favor of common core in other words, education of your children from d.c. no way 


it is clinton and sanders people who disrupted my rally in chicago and then they say i must talk to my people. phony politicians 
the last person that hillary or bernie want to run against is donald trump and that is fact 
we are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in florida on behalf of little marco rubio. no way to run a country 
word is early voting in fl is very dishonest. little marco, his state chairman, & their minions are working overtime trying to rig the vote. 


make america great again 
on my way to dayton, ohio. will be there soon 
the rally in cincinnati is on. media put out false reports that it was cancelled. will be great love you ohio 
ohio had the biggest budget increase in the u.s. if it were not for striking oil, they would be bust governor kasich in favor of tpp fraud 
absentee governor kasich voted for nafta and nafta devastated ohio a disaster from which it never recovered. kasich is good for mexico 
the organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our first amendment rights in chicago, have totally energized america 


it means so much to me receiving an endorsement from phyllis schlafly. a truly great woman & conservative.pic.twitter.com/11remu99qc

congratulation to adam scott and all of the folks at trump national doral on producing a really great wgc tournament. amazing finish 
i will be using facebook and twitter to expose dishonest lightweight senator marco rubio. a record no show in senate, he is scamming florida 
we cannot let the failing republican establishment, who could not stop obama (twice), ruin the movement with millions of $'s in false ads 
lindsey graham is all over t.v., much like failed 47% candidate mitt romney. these nasty, angry, jealous failures have zero credibility 
failed presidential candidate lindsey graham should respect me. i destroyed his run, brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out. now nasty 
how do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians? i will be using facebook & twitter. watch 
all of the phony t.v. commercials against me are bought and payed for by special interest groups, the bandits that tell your pols what to do 


.@meetthepress and @chucktodd did a 1 hour hit job on me today – totally biased and mostly false. dishonest media

the phony lawsuit against trump u could have been easily settled by me but i want to go to court. 98% approval rating by students. easy win 
why did mitt romney beg me for my endorsement four years ago? 
i am the only one who can beat hillary clinton. i am not a mitt romney, who doesn't know how to win. hillary wants no part of trump 
why would the great people of florida vote for a guy who, as a senator, never even shows up to vote worst record. marco rubio is a joke 
i have brought millions of people into the republican party, while the dems are going down. establishment wants to kill this movement 
failed candidate mitt romney,who ran one of the worst races in presidential history,is working with the establishment to bury a big r win 
@malski1954: i changed parties to vote for you, no one else measures up to you, the gope needs a reality check. our country is at stake 
looks like two time failed candidate mitt romney is going to be telling republicans how to get elected. not a good messenger 
millions of dollars being spent on false tv ads by special interest groups who own rubio & cruz.when you see them think of your puppet pols 
@johnsmi01433966: the establishment doesn't like you because they can't control you and get you to lie to us and keep ripping us off. 
because of me, the republican party has taken in millions of new voters, a record. if they are not careful, they will all leave. sad

@kinnardjan: @itsjoeco @realdonaldtrump i took trump university class and saved my home 
marco rubio lost big last night. i even beat him in virginia, where he spent so much time and money. now his bosses are desperate and angry 
why would anyone in florida vote for lightweight senator marco rubio. check out his credit card scam, his house sale & his no show voting 
the special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent t.v. ads on me. 
@joenbc: fox calls virginia for trump. if it holds, it's a big win for trump and a big setback for rubio, who needed to win the state. 

@norahodonnell: looks like rubio won't get any delegates from tx or al because he didn't meet 20% threshold.

@sassypantsjj: michigan gop poll 2/24/2016 trump 35.5 rubio 15.0 cruz 14.3 kasich 12.8 carson 8.3 @realdonaldtrump wow 


@itsblakec: @realdonaldtrump trump is a genius. rubio and cruz are not. i want a brilliant mind to run this country. 
@donnieboysmith: @realdonaldtrump in contrast to rubio and cruz you look like a giant. they look terribly weak thank you 




they don't like rubio in florida he left them high & dry. doesn't even show up for votes 
lightweight marco rubio was working hard last night. the problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a choker mr. meltdown. 
wow, every poll said i won the debate last night. great honor 
lightweight choker marco rubio looks like a little boy on stage. not presidential material 
lying ted cruz and lightweight choker marco rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. they failed 
will be at fort worth (texas) convention center at 11:30 a.m. big crowd get there early big announcement to be made 
why would the people of florida vote for marco rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their senator and then quit 
have a good chance to win texas on tuesday. cruz is a nasty guy, not one senate endorsement and, despite talk, gets nothing done. loser 
i will be making a speech at 12:00 in fort worth, texas. really big crowd expected. will be talking about the debate last night plus, plus 
@waltseher: @realdonaldtrump @morg25016893 @eventbrite yup 200 polish immigrants were hired by his contractor not trump 
@mjp1370: @realdonaldtrump cruz talks about hillary all the time because he knows he can't beat you trump will win texas 
@donell27743094: @realdonaldtrump trump won the debate. disgusting rubio said peed is he still in junior high school. 
@tdltdltdltdl: marco cruz and ted rubio (easy to get the two politicians confused) looked like desperate, panicked dc insiders tonight 
@skylerdeckard: @realdonaldtrump that's because you've never hired anyone to do work before favorite line from tonights debate. 
@restorereality: tonight you proved to america you are the real deal. you took fire from all sides, stayed composed, returned fire and won 
@slytle24: @davidaxelrod @realdonaldtrump @cnn he won almost all polls and mark halperin gave him an a 

@morg25016893: @eventbrite also, all the things rubio&cruz were using for hits, just petty. trump, clearly the only one w/all the skills. 

all the online polls have me winning the debate. i really enjoyed the evening. not easy, but good. ://thehill.com/blogs/ballot box/presidential races/270873 trump leads post debate online polls … 




failed presidential candidate @mittromney was made to look like a fool by senator harry reid & didn't release his tax returns until 9/21/12. 

fmr pres of mexico, vicente fox horribly used the f word when discussing the wall. he must apologize if i did that there would be a uproar 
early on ted cruz said that if he didn't win south carolina, it's over. he didn't win and lost to me in a landslide 


i'm going to do what @mittromney was totally unable to do win 
lets make america great again schedule & tickets: ://www.donaldjtrump.com/schedule pic.twitter.com/guqo1tmsmo 
signing a recent tax return isn't this ridiculous?pic.twitter.com/udwqf4iziz 
just for your info, tax returns have 0 to do w/ someone’s net worth. i have already filed my financial statements w/ fec. they are great 
why doesn’t @mittromney just endorse @marcorubio already. should have done it before nh or nevada where he had a little sway. too late now 
mitt romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. dope 

@chatteringteef: @borntobegop @realdonaldtrump @mittromney hates to see trump's success when he was so pathetic 
@classyexplorer: @ahernandez85a romney is a pawn of the establishment and has no individual thought process. he is jealous of trump 
@conservativevin: @ahernandez85a romney should have been a tough guy with obama. he cowered and lost. badly he's not relevant 
@stevekwebb: @realdonaldtrump love it @tedcruz is done. we need someone who is proven. @realdonaldtrump will make america great again 

@hosiern: @foxnewspolitics a vote for @tedcruz or @marcorubio is a vote for corruption, special interests and lobbyists. trump for potus 

ted cruz is lying again. polls are showing that i do beat hillary clinton head to head. check out ://u.s.a.today  poll snd q poll. 

@gricecindy: that's why we are angry. the republican establishment will not support you. you are who the american people want 
@ddpick18: @realdonaldtrump this texan will be voting trump march 1st. cruz is a fake texan 
.@repchriscollins chris, thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement. i will not let you down @cnn 
when ted cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear, i will get most of his votes no problem 
why would texans vote for liar ted cruz when he was born in canada, lived there for 4 years and remained a canadian citizen until recently 
when mitt romney asked me for my endorsement last time around, he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win 

mitt romney,who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool, is now playing tough guy 
the polls show that i picked up many jeb bush supporters. that is how i got to 46%. when others drop out, i will pick up more. sad but true 

in all of television the only one who said anything bad about last nights landslide victory was dopey @karlrove. he should be fired 
i am in virginia @regentu presidential forum with dr. pat robertson beginning now watch here: ://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews  

.@usatoday poll and @quinnipiacpoll say that i beat both hillary and bernie, and i havn't even started on them yet 
big defeat last night in nevada for ted cruz and marco rubio. @karlrove on @foxnews is working hard to belittle my victory. rove is sick 
@melaniatrump did great on television this morning. poised, smart and strong, with a big heart so much to offer. we are all proud of you 
melania will be interviewed by @morningmika on @morning_joe now (8:30 a.m.). enjoy 

thank you nevada we will make america safe & great again ://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/posts/10156680424255725:0 …pic.twitter.com/zvvyvciad4 
make sure you get on the trump line and are not mislead by the cruz people. they are bad be careful. 

go vote from now to 8:30 p.m. nevada. i will be at various caucus sites. make america great again 
my wife melania will be on @morning_joe tomorrow morning at 8:00. interviewed by @morningmika enjoy 

club for growth is the group that came to my office seeking $1 million dollars. i told them no and now they are doing negative ads. 
great. just reported on @foxnews that many people who supported @jebbush are now supporting me. i knew that would happen, pundits didn't 
wow, great ohio poll. shows me leading by 5 points, beating k 
unlike the other republican candidates, i will be in nevada all day and night i won't be fleeing, in and out. i love & invest in nevada 

@stevenmeyers11: @vogelsong1 @edrollins @foxnews ed rollins is the only one of those people that understands process & gets it right 
i am growing the republican party tremendously just look at the numbers, way up democrats numbers are significantly down from years past. 
@jojo2foxy: trump is unstoppable....he is what common sense americans want whether republican, independent or a reagan democrat. 
@vogelsong1: @edrollins gets it. was just on @foxnews explaining how trump wins the general election. thank you ed 
ted cruz lifts the bible high into the air and then lies like a dog over and over again the evangelicals in s.c. figured him out & said no 
ted cruz does not have the right temperment to be president. look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. bad 
wow was ted cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. he used him as a scape goat fired like a dog ted panicked. 
ted cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in s.c. he is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration. 


ted cruz said on @oreillyfactor that illegals sent out of country by my administration would come right back as citizens. another lie crazy 
a big fat hit job on @oreillyfactor tonight. a total waste of time to watch, boring and biased. @brithume said i would never run, a dope 
great town hall tonight at 10:00 p.m. (eastern) conducted by @seanhannity on @foxnews 




just watched the very incompetent mitt romney campaign strategist, stuart stevens. now i know why mitt lost so badly. stevens is a clown 


ted cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in iowa. weak rnc and republican leadership probably won't let this happen sad. 
just saw the phony ad by cruz totally false, more dirty tricks. he got caught in so many lies is this man crazy? 
ted cruz has now apologized to marco rubio and ben carson for fraud and dirty tricks. no wonder he has lost evangelical support 
ted cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false no basis in fact. take ad down ted. biggest liar in politics 
wow, ted cruz falsely suggested marco rubio mocked the bible and was just forced to fire his communications director. more dirty tricks 
it is so important to audit the federal reserve, and yet ted cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done. 

many people are now saying i won south carolina because of the last debate. i showed anger and the people of our country are very angry 

@scotmreed: no matter what liar sleazeball @rickwtyler says about @tedcruz in tennessee. we have early voting and @realdonaldtrump has won. 
i hear the rickets family, who own the chicago cubs, are secretly spending $'s against me. they better be careful, they have a lot to hide 
@1sonny12: @ksmith233035 @mitchellvii floridians are upset because rubio did not do what he promised once he was elected vote trump 
@gregusp61: you really rocked them hard in s.c. rubio and cruz were pummled. so glad jeb is gone next no liar 
the reason that ted cruz lost the evangelicals in s.c. is because he is a world class liar, and evangelicals do not like liars 
i am in las vegas, at the best hotel (by far), trump international. i will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to win nevada 

a number of months ago, i was not expected to win south carolina,ted cruz was, and yet i won in a landslide every group and category. win

thank you @sarahpalinusa for your amazing help and support. big win, leaving now for atlanta and nevada.the people of south carolina got it 

what a great night. thank you south carolina, a special place with truly amazing people love 
people (pundits) gave me no chance in south carolina. now it looks like a possible win. i would be happy with a one vote victory (hope) 
@carrollkuykend2: this veteran just voted @realdonaldtrump in the sc primary, let's make america great again 
south carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands. vote now (today), and make america great again 
remember that marco rubio is very weak on illegal immigration. south carolina needs strength as illegals and syrians pour in. don't allow it 
i wonder if president obama would have attended the funeral of justice scalia if it were held in a mosque? very sad that he did not go 
@carolyn82471448: @waynedupreeshow @realdonaldtrump all aboard the trump train 

i am the only candidate (in many years) who is self funding his campaign. lobbyists and $ interests totally control all other candidates 

@birgitolsen1: @realdonaldtrump @justice41ca @vote_for_trump everybody on twitter get out to vote for trump today in south carolina 


@resistyr: mr.trump...both cruz and rubio are ineligible to be potus it's a slam dunk case check it ://powderedwigsociety.com/eligibility of cruz and rubio/ …

i was referring to a backstop for pre existing conditions. i will eliminate the law, in its entirety, & replace it w/ something much better. 



@kathytravels777: ĺ @andersoncooper tonight on cnn @realdonaldtrump was great. loved the intimacy of conversation w the people 




response to the pope: ://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/posts/10156658168535725 … 
i agree with marco rubio that ted cruz is a liar 
.@foxnews is changing their theme from fair and balanced to unfair and unbalanced. but dying @wsj is worse.their phony poll is a joke 



new cbs national poll just out massive lead for trump. the wall street journal/nbc poll is a total joke. no wonder wsj is doing so badly 
i love being in south carolina. we are leading big in all of the state polls saturday is a big day. make america great again 
the just out usa today national poll, where i lead by big numbers, shows that in a head to head matchup, i beat both hillary and bernie. 
amazing that while i lead by big numbers in the new q and and usa today polls, the the press only wants to report on the phony wsj/nbc poll. 




jeb bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. he wants to look cool, but it's far too late. 1% in nevada 
just out nevada poll shows jeb bush at 1%, he should take his dumb mouthpiece, @lindseygrahamsc, and just go home. 
.@foxnews is so biased it is disgusting. they do not want trump to win. all negative 
i will beat hillary easily, but lindsey graham says i won't, and yet he got zero against me no cred why does fox put him on? 
.@lindseygraham, who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace saying the most horrible things about me on @foxnews. 
interesting how president obama so haltingly said i would never be president this from perhaps the worst president in u.s. history 


why does @megynkelly devote so much time on her shows to me, almost always negative? without me her ratings would tank. get a life megyn 

thank you @kayleighmcenany for your nice words great knowledge and style we are doing really well in south carolina. @cnn @donlemon 
@good2bqueen67: @brithume @megynkelly they're too lame to get it, sir. when you win the election they'll get it. 
.@brithume thinks that when republicans drop out of the race, someone will pick up all of that vote. the fact is i will get much of it 
explain to @brithume and @megynkelly, who know nothing, that i will beat hillary and win states (and dem indie votes) that no other r can 






new ppp poll just out trump up big, cruz, rubio and bush down. the debate results, even with a stacked rnc audience, were wonderful 
spent the full day at meetings and a major rally yesterday in south carolina. great people and spirit. today will be more of the same. 




jeb is a hypocrite used massive private eminent domain just another clueless politician ://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/02/08/governor jeb bush has a much more serious eminent domain problem than donald trump/ … 
jeb used eminent domain & took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2) ://newswithviews.com/nelson/kelleigh272.htm … 
i'd like to call jeb a liar, but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used eminent domain when criticizing me (1/2) 
now that george bush is campaigning for jeb( ), is he fair game for questions about world trade center, iraq war and eco collapse? careful 
i will be in south carolina all week. saturday is big, big, big get out and vote make america great again 
jeb bush and ted cruz are not electable presidential candidates, hillary would destroy them. ted may not be eligible to run born in canada 
funny that jeb( ) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.then mommy, now brother 
ted cruz, along with jeb bush, pushed justice john roberts onto the supreme court. roberts could have killed obamacare twice, but didn't 
wow, in the new cbs poll i went way up into the forties thank you 
tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests the bosses 
loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said i won, but the rnc did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. all donors & special ints

@autumnandews08: @realdonaldtrump @jebbush jeb is incompetent and will lose, don't waste your energy on that cry baby 
even though every poll, time, drudge etc., has me winning the debate by a lot, @foxnews only puts negative people on. biased a total joke 
@jeffpaine: @realdonaldtrump you crushed the debate thank you 



all polls have me winning debate big drudge, time, etc. dopey charles krauthammer still nasty. he has zero cred totally dishonest 

thank you i miss my father. ://twitter.com/eustacefash/status/698735409501757440 … 


ted cruz is a cheater he holds the bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts 
nasty ted cruz is at it again same dirty tricks he used w/ @realbencarson saying i may not be on ballot & i hold liberal positions. lies 
wow honored to be chosen by the highly respected accurate washington & lee mock convention. i hope you are right i will make you proud 
the totally unexpected loss of supreme court justice antonin scalia is a massive setback for the conservative movement and our country 
love the people of south carolina look very much forward to the debate tonight.

word is that little morty zuckerman’s @nydailynews loses more than $50 million per year can that be possible?

11,000 inside venue tonight in tampa broke record set by elton john in 1988 w/out musical instruments another 5,000 outside. will be back 


millions of $'s of false ads, paid for by lobbyists special interests of cheater @sentedcruz and sleepy @jebbush, are now running in s.c. 
@copyover2001: @realdonaldtrump do americans really want a canadian born president? first non native born in history? 
@by @tedcruz good i want to see the court decide what i was always told natural born means born on american soil 

last time lightweight @jebbush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. if he doesn't do better this time, he is out 
if @tedcruz doesn’t clean up his act, stop cheating, & doing negative ads, i have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen. 
lightweight @jebbush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in sc. false advertising desperate and sad 
after hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1m from me, they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect & ill informed ads. 
nothing conservative about the club for growth coming into my office and demanding a $1m contribution, which naturally, they did not get.

@truthinvest: @cnn @tedcruz @realdonaldtrump ted cruz is the definition of sleaze. just ask @realbencarson 

we are getting reports from many voters that the cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest pushpolls on me. we are watching 
jeb failed as jeb he gave up and enlisted mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of iraq). spent $120 million.weak no chance 
he (or she) who hesitates is lost: make america great again 
remember, it was the republican party, with the help of conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, but didn't keep them hi dt 
.@markhalperin showed a focus group on @morning_joe me using a very bad word. i never said the word, left an open blank. please apologize 
jeb bush spent more than $40,000,000 in new hampshire to come in 4 or 5, i spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st. big difference in capability 
there are no buyers for the worthless @nydailynews but little mort zuckerman is frantically looking. it is bleeding red ink a total loser 
i have been consistent in my opposition to common core. get rid of common core keep education local 

@haryder: which is it @realdonaldtrump ?are you planning on getting rid of common core or keeping it? get rid of it fast. 
i was referring to the fact that jeb bush wants to keep common core. 
big speech tonight in south carolina 7:00 p.m. tremendous crowd 
so funny, jeb bush called me a highly gifted politician and a great entertainer i assume that is a compliment 
such a great experience in new hampshire amazing people will be leaving for a big event in south carolina today. 
like the worthless @nydailynews, looks like @politico will be going out of business. bad reporting no money, no cred 
worthless @nydailynews, which dopey mort zuckerman, is desperately trying to sell, has no buyer liabilities are massive 
dopey mort zuckerman, owner of the worthless @nydailynews, has a major inferiority complex. paper will close soon 
@markhalperin: my report card grades for the 2 new hampshire winners: donaldtrump a: v strong energy/close. berniesanders b : went too long 
thank you to the people of new hampshire, i love you now, off to south carolina. 

we will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into new hampshire from our open southern border. we will build a wall and have security. 
we will immediately repeal and replace obamacare and nobody can do that like me. we will save $'s and have much better healthcare 
isis is making big threats today no respect for u.s.a. or our leader if i win it will be a very different story,with very fast results 
new hampshire vote today make america great again 



make america great again 
i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:40. a.m. enjoy 
the polls are now showing that i am the best to win the general election. states that are never in play for repubs will be won by me. great 
no one has done more for people with disabilities than me. i have spent many millions of dollars to help out and am happy to have done so 
i know the governors and jeb bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. his family used private eminent domain 
remember @jebbush wants common core (education from d.c.) and is very weak on illegal immigration ( come as act of love ). not a leader 



now that bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign, he says he would end super pacs. sad 

america needs strong leadership. politicians can talk but they don’t get things done. video: ://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/videos/10156620333635725/ …pic.twitter.com/lbxxyuzaco 
everybody is laughing at jeb bush spent $100 million and is at bottom of pack. a pathetic figure 


jeb bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a super bowl ad. he is a weak candidate 
my two wonderful sons, don and eric, will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 now enjoy. 
so far the super bowl is very boring not nearly as exciting as politics make america great again

@newtgingrich: trump shows courage in defending eminent domain as a necessity for construction of infrastructure 
@newtgingrich: trump hits it out of the park in describing effective deal making 
@joenbc: trump, kasich, jeb and christie all had good nights.

@maryann1942: @realdonaldtrump why vote for trump? unlike politicians all talk, trump’s talk materializes he will make america great again 



i very much look forward to tomorrow’s debate in new hampshire—so many things to say, so much at stake. it will be an incredible evening 

big storm in new hampshire. moved my event to monday. will be there next four days. 

@rkswaney7: @cnn @realdonaldtrump i agree. great businessman. i like your tone tonight keep it up & you'll have this democrats vote. 
watch @ac360 on now @cnn 
i will be interviewed by anderson cooper at 8pm on @cnn from new hampshire. should be very interesting 


this is the cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone, a misdemeanor at minimum.pic.twitter.com/tmav17ugkf 
.@oreillyfactor @karlrove as per the show, an even more serious cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone. 

thank you @billoreilly & @karlrove. ted cruz should be immediately disqualified in iowa, with each candidate moving up one notch. 
sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me. he would be so easy to beat 



dr. ben carson blasted ted cruz for deceit and dirty tricks and lies. 

the state of iowa should disqualify ted cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated a total fraud 

i will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 p.m. enjoy @foxnews 
based on the fraud committed by senator ted cruz during the iowa caucus, either a new election should take place or cruz results nullified. 
and finally, cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that trump was strongly in favor of obamacare and choice a total lie 
the voter violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of f) and told them to clear it up by voting for cruz. fraud 
many people voted for cruz over carson because of this cruz fraud. also, cruz sent out a voter violation certificate to thousands of voters. 
during primetime of the iowa caucus, cruz put out a release that @realbencarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for cruz. 
ted cruz didn't win iowa, he stole it. that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. bad 
great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany @cherijacobus begged us for a job. we said no and she went hostile. a real dummy @cnn 

anybody who watched all of ted cruz's far too long, rambling, overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his howard dean moment 
@stephbewitching @realdonaldtrump all you haters need to realize trump got the second highest vote in history. and he's never held office 

@ellenespence @realdonaldtrump amazing job in iowa cruz just barely won. 
@93101dianne @realdonaldtrump if you can do that well in iowa then i see you acing it in all other significant states. momentum is growing 
@lorewestphal @realdonaldtrump you must win the presidency in 2016 
.@morning_joe @mikebarnicle on @realdonaldtrump: he finished 2nd but he made the turn successfully like a pro 
i don't believe i have been given any credit by the voters for self funding my campaign, the only one. i will keep doing, but not worth it 
i will be talking about my wonderful experience in iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media later in new hampshire. big crowd 
the media has not covered my long shot great finish in iowa fairly. brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history 
because i was told i could not do well in iowa, i spent very little there a fraction of cruz & rubio. came in a strong second. great honor 
my experience in iowa was a great one. i started out with all of the experts saying i couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. nice 
it all begins today we will finally take our country back and make america great again 





i will be interviewed on face the nation with @jdickerson this morning. enjoy 
i am in iowa. will be interviewed on this week with @gstephanopoulos this morning. enjoy 
if i would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). also, vets got $6,000,000. 
by not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, i was able to make the point of not allowing unfairness while raising $6,000,000 for vets. 
wow, just saw an ad cruz is lying on so many levels. there is nobody more against obamacare than me, will repeal & replace. he lies 
ted cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important financial disclosure form. very low interest loans, scam 
ted cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in canada). will loose big to hillary. polls show i beat hillary easily win 
i will be going to church in iowa this morning with my wife, melania. after church i will be making two speeches and touring the state 
.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man. when i wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more, he endorsed cruz. @foxandfriends 
.@bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event. the people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100,000 for himself.phony @foxandfriends 
.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. asked me for expensive hotel rooms, free (and more). i said pay and he endorsed cruz 
the cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters in violation. they are now under investigation. bad 


i want to thank evangelical christians for the warm embrace i've received on the campaign trail. video: ://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/videos/10156583412010725/ … 
i will be in iowa all day and until tuesday morning. finally, after all these years of watching stupidity, we will make america great again 
hillary clinton is a major national security risk. not presidential material 

@gigglemitz: @geraldorivera @foxnews damn fox is really acting like a baby today. i guess trump got under their skin pretty biased 
@classyexplorer: @oreillyfactor @drudge so bill if america was so longing to learn more about candidates why the 50 percent audience loss? 

.@oreillyfactor the people of iowa love the fact that i stuck up for my rights, as i will do for the u.s. also got $6,000,000 for our vets 
.@foxnews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6,000,000 raised in one hour for our vets. 
amazing that ted cruz can't even get a senator like @bensasse, who is easy, to endorse him. not one senator is endorsing canada ted 
.@bensasse looks more like a gym rat than a u.s. senator. how the hell did he ever get elected? @greta 
the great state of nebraska can do much better than @bensasse as your senator. saw him on @greta totally ineffective. wants paid for pols. 
the new e mail release is a disaster for hillary clinton. at a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president? 

they say that if i participated in last night’s fox debate, they would have had 12 million more & would have broken the all time record.

the debate tonight will be a total disaster low ratings with advertisers and advertising rates dropping like a rock. i hate to see this. 
@laurencristmann: @realdonaldtrump why do they have so many debates this year?? also, why is cruz still allowed to run, he's not eligible 
@hollywoodjv: @realdonaldtrump mr. trump, why does cruz hate canada so much. he should embrace his roots, it's a great country so true 
wow, two candidates called last night and said they want to go to my event tonight at drake university. 

@rick_gobbi: @realdonaldtrump ...hold up a mirror so the network cameras show how big the crowd is. great idea 
@plazzmatic: @realdonaldtrump @danpgabriel sounds like the advertisers want trump, he knows what he is doing. 

@dukeofbc: @megynkelly debate cruz one on one. i would just tell him that you were to busy running for the president of usa, not canada 
@cjcboi: @drjamescabot @realdonaldtrump @danscavino @carolde @playstrumpcard checked your wallet lately, mr ailes?

on greta, 87% of the people said they would not watch the debate if i'm not in it. wow what an honor 
fox debate advertising rates falling like a rock tune into my special event for the veterans at 9pm est 

it was the childishly written & taunting pr statement by fox that made me not do the debate, more so than lightweight reporter, @megynkelly.

even though i beat him in the first six debates, especially the last one, ted cruz wants to debate me again. can we do it in canada? 
just got to listen to rush limbaugh the guy is fantastic 
the statement put out yesterday by @foxnews was a disgrace to good broadcasting and journalism. who would ever say something so nasty & dumb 
i refuse to call megyn kelly a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct. instead i will only call her a lightweight reporter

ted cruz poll numbers are down big. because he was born in canada and was, until recently, a canadian citizen, many believe he cannot run 
i am in iowa watching all of these phony t.v. ads by the other candidates. all bull, politicians are all talk and no action it won't happen 
.@anncoulter has been amazing. we will win and establish strong borders, we will build a wall and mexico will pay. we will be great again

i am in iowa. will be making two speeches today. good luck to all of the great folks on the east coast. enjoy the beauty of the storm 


is cruz honest? he is in bed w/ wall st. & is funded by goldman sachs/citi, low interest loans. no legal disclosure & never sold off assets. 

cruz says i supported tarp, which gave $25 million to goldman sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. puppet 
the only reason irrelevant @glennbeck doesn't like me is i refused to do his failing show asked many times. very few listeners sad 
.@brentbozell, one of the national review lightweights, came to my office begging for money like a dog. why doesn't he say that? 
just watched jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. jeb mom can't help you with isis, the chinese or with putin. 
ted cruz went down big in just released reuters poll what's going on? is it goldman sachs/citi loans or canada? 

the tax scam washington post does among the most inaccurate stories of all. really dishonest reporting. 

wow new national zogby poll just out:.trump 45. cruz 13. rubio 8. big numbers. 
leaving nevada now for iowa. things are looking good great new polls

after spending $89 million, @jebbush is at the bottom of the barrel in polls. he is ashamed to use the name bush in ads. low energy guy 
the failing @nro national review magazine has just been informed by the republican national committee that they cannot participate in debate 



highly respected constitutional law professor mary brigid mcmanamon has just stated, ted cruz is not eligible to be president. big problem 




@realollietaylor: isn't it time we had a president? let goofy glen keep canada cruz who can't win. the american people have trump 
ted cruz complains about my views on eminent domain, but without it we wouldn't have roads, highways, airports, schools or even pipelines. 
the late, great, william f. buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize, the dying national review 
very few people read the national review because it only knows how to criticize, but not how to lead. 
national review is a failing publication that has lost it's way. it's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. sad 

why does @greta have a fired bushy like dummy, john sununu on spewing false info? i will beat hillary by a lot, she wants no part of trump. 




happy birthday to my friend, the great @jacknicklaus a totally special guy 
new day on cnn treats me very badly. @alisyncamerota is a disaster. not going to watch anymore. 
low energy candidate @jebbush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign. millions spent on me. he should go home and relax 
sad sack @jebbush has just done another ad on me, with special interest money, saying i won't beat hillary i will. but he can't beat me. 
so sad that @cnn and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in oklahoma. dishonest reporting 
@americanaspie: @glennbeck @sarahpalinusa remember when glenn gave out gifts to illegal aliens at crossing the border? me too 



wacko @glennbeck is a sad answer to the @sarahpalinusa endorsement that cruz so desperately wanted. glenn is a failing, crying, lost soul

.@thebrodyfile great job on @ac360. thank you for the very smart and kind words 

i don't think ted cruz can even run for president until he can assure republican voters that being born in canada is not a problem. doubt 
ted cruz is falling in the polls. he is nervous. people are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks

when will @tedcruz give all the new york based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him. 
everybody that loves the people of new york, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like ted cruz out of politics 
if ted cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage? 
ted is the ultimate hypocrite. says one thing for money, does another for votes. ://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/politics/at new york reception ted cruz is said to strike different tone toward gays.html?referer= … 

ted cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. they own him 
based on the fact that ted cruz was born in canada and is therefore a natural born canadian, did he borrow unreported loans from c banks? 
oh no, just reported that ted cruz didn't report another loan, this one from citi. wow, no wonder banks do so well in the u.s. senate. 
the ted cruz wiseguy apology to the people of new york is a disgrace. remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there 
was there another loan that ted cruz forgot to file. goldman sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. not much of a reformer 
ted cruz said he didn't know that he was a canadian citizen. he also forgot to file his goldman sachs million $ loan papers.not believable 
ted cruz was born in canada and was a canadian citizen until 15 months ago. lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. i told you so 
more radical islam attacks today it never ends strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. no more being politically correct. 
.@frankluntz is a total clown. has zero credibility @foxnews @megynkelly 
.@oreillyfactor please explain to the very dumb and failing @glennbeck that i supported john mccain big league in 2008, not obama 
just got back from iowa had a great time with amazing people. will be back soon 
.@geraldorivera thank you geraldo for your nice words on @oreillyfactor tonight. you are a true champion thank @ericbolling great guy 
@geraldorivera @sentedcruz got ass kicked by @realdonaldtrump last night he offended every new yorker & has no answer to natural born issue 


sen. lindsey graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for president and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of bush. 
jeb bush, who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero, just got graham endorsement. graham quit at o. 


@ameriflames: @realdonaldtrump @clewandowski_ no one wants a bush or a clinton, they want a straight shooter like trump 


do you think iran would have acted so tough if they were russian sailors? our country was humiliated. 
@bonfiredesigns: standing with @realdonaldtrump as he defends our sailors and military and americans in the usa ://twitter.com/melindaross123/status/687706108807397376 … 
@melindaross123: @foxnews @realdonaldtrump there isn't anything donald trump says that i don't agree with. go trump 

united states looks more and more like a paper tiger. won't be that way if i win 
iran humiliated the united states with the capture of our 10 sailors. horrible pictures & images. we are weak. i will not forget 
stuart stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches. romney campaign,his book,etc. why does @andersoncooper put him on? 
why does @cnn & @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist, stuart stevens who lost big for romney on the show? 





sadly, there is no way that ted cruz can continue running in the republican primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. dems will sue 
@johnkurkosky: @carolde @the_lady_colors @drjamescabot @tamidurling @aceofspadeshq this election is about americas future, vote trump 

iran toys with u.s. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. don't release money. we want our hostages back now 
numerous polls have me beating hillary clinton. in a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in u.s. history i get most new voters 
the state of the union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non substantive i have heard in a long time. new leadership fast 
just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on iowa push polls negative to me. not nice, but ok new polls are great. 




such a serious problem for ted & the gop. great doubt, dems will sue let's all work together to solve this problem. ://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/01/11/through ted cruz constitutional looking glass/zvke6qpf31q2rsvpo9ngok/story.html …

the tonight show begins in 5 minutes. enjoy

fantastic job on @cnn tonight. @kayleighmcenany is a winner @donlemon 
don't forget to watch the tonight show with the wonderful @jimmyfallon at 11:30 p.m. you will not be disappointed @nbc 
face the nation's interview of me was the highest rated show that they have had in 15 years. congratulations and wow @cbsnews @jdickerson 
.@majorcbs major garrett of @cbsnews covers me very inaccurately. total agenda, bad reporter 
thank you michael harrison @talkersmagazine for your kind words greatly appreciated 

.@megynkelly recently said that she can’t be wooed by trump. she is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her 

.@ringlingbros is retiring their elephants the circus will never be the same. 
congratulations to @jdickerson of face the nation on his highest ratings in 15 years. 4.6 million people watched my interview thank you 

so professional of @abc news to throw out the failing @unionleader newspaper from their debate. paper won't survive, highly unethical 
great job on fox this morning @katiepavlich. i am sending out for your book immediately. thank you very much 

why does @thisweekabc w/ @gstephanopoulos allow a hater & racist like @tavissmiley to waste good airtime? @abc can do much better than him 

union leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the abc news debate like a dog. for starters, try getting a new publisher 
ul has lost all credibility under joe mcquaid w circulation dropping to record lows. they aren't worthy of representing the great people nh. 
this is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. i said it should not be allowed and abc agreed. 
if their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn’t questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can’t win. 
i am pleased to announce that i had the union leader removed from the upcoming debate. ://www.politico.com/blogs/on media/2016/01/abc severs debate partnership with union leader 217560 … 
remember, get time magazine i am on the cover. take it out in 4 years and read it again just watch... 
heading now for reno, nevada, for a big rally. good poll numberd all over 
in the just out @foxnews poll, i easily beat hillary clinton and i havn't even focused on her yet. on our way: make america great again 
yesterday in iowa was amazing two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. they love that i am the only candidate self funding

i will be interviewed by chris wallace on fox tomorrow morning. tune in 
i'm protesting the @unionleader from having anything to do w/ abc debate. their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved

south carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun). i am now off to iowa for two big rallies packed houses. love it 
pat buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @cnn way to go pat, way ahead of your time 
great even in sc tonight fire marshall would not let everyone in 5,000 turned away. thank you for coming 
will be at venue, in wonderful south carolina, very soon. big traffic back up, tremendous crowd will be wild. 



i hope all workers demand that their @teamsters reps endorse donald j. trump. nobody knows jobs like i do don’t let them sell you out 
on my way to south carolina. big crowd look forward to it 
not good news for jeb bush ://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeb bush liked republicans_568fba2be4b0c8beacf694f4 … 
hank greenberg, formerly of aig, gave $10 million to the @jebbush campaign 3 months ago. he is not happy, a total waste of money 
@rlbenney: @realdonaldtrump you did great and showed courage going to burlington. no other gop candidate would do what you did tonight 
@pink_sprnva: @pastormike7 @thehill i agree with you on this. @realdonaldtrump won't be good. he will be great 

@hofmannken: donaldtrump, wish i could attend one of your rallies, none are close enough. make america great again for my kids.thank you 
great time in burlington, vermont. crowd was amazing. 

i'm leaving now for burlington, vermont. it will be wild 
joy behar, who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings, is even worse on @theview. we love barbara 
the @theview @abc, once great when headed by @barbarajwalters, is now in total freefall. whoopi goldberg is terrible. very sad 
hillary and her friends ://www.instagram.com/p/bapvz 1ghbp/  
weak & ineffective @jebbush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. false advertising 
i have an idea for @jebbush whose campaign is a disaster. try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it 
.@sentedcruz ted free legal advice on how to pre empt the dems on citizen issue. go to court now & seek declaratory judgment you will win 
massive crowd in vt tonight. venue not big enough. officials say no to outside event and sound system. arrive early 
man shot inside paris police station. just announced that terror threat is at highest level. germany is a total mess big crime. get smart 
i will be in beautiful burlington, vermont, tonight for a rally. will be great fun. make america great again 
it was a very wise move that ted cruz renounced his canadian citizenship 18 months ago. senator john mccain is certainly no friend of ted 
.@macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the s&p last year, plunging 46%. very disloyal company. another win for trump boycott. 
the failing @unionleader newspaper in n.h. just sent the trump organization a letter asking that we take ads. how stupid, how desperate 
do you believe that @unionleader in nh was demanding ads? look at enclosed letter from them, just received: ://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/posts/10156502334810725:0 … 
i will be on @wolfblitzer for a @cnnsitroom interview today. please join us 5pm et.

@becker_berta: @longtalltexan20 trump single handedly did what no other politician ever dared to do, attacked the media for all their lies 
@arkaysdesign: @slone @realdonaldtrump have to get people of all ages out to vote for donald trump 
@compresphyllis: @seanhannity @foxnews i am so glad u are for trump your program is my favorite. the don is by far the best 
@kacee50: @realdonaldtrump women make up the fastest growing market in gun sales. and hillary wants to take those rights away from women 
@kristopheryan11: @realdonaldtrump mr trump you were excellent on @seanhannity tonight thank you

@trumpy17: @realdonaldtrump gave an awesome speech in claremont tonight 


@longtalltexan20 @realdonaldtrump i love it when trump calls out msm for what they really are cams starting to show crowds at rallies 
@lucky5713 @newday what's wrong with showing morocco? nothing it illustrates a point duh love the video 
i don’t know @samuelljackson, to best of my knowledge haven't played golf w/him & think he does too many tv commercials—boring. not a fan. 
wow @unionleader circulation in nh has dropped from 75,000 to around 10—bad management. no wonder they begged me for ads. 
@lilredfrmkokomo: @realdonaldtrump my facebook groups are all voting trump /4000 people great

@samuelghaddad: wow let's hear it for the factor. let the truth be known. more are beginning to realize @realdonaldtrump is the real deal 
@thecybermenace: @realdonaldtrump donald trump hit one out of the ballpark in lowell, ma tonight 

the rally in lowell, massachusetts, was amazing. 10,000 people going wild. make america great again 
woody johnson, owner of the nyjets, is @jebbush’s finance chairman. if woody would’ve been w/me, he would’ve been in the playoffs, at least 
i look forward to being in lowell, massachusetts, today. i hear a very big crowd is expected we will have lots of fun 
@rhettriley1234: trump only wins with our votes. we must grow trump nation and do our part. vote. this is our time. 

by the way, hillary & the msm forgot to mention that hillary is in the al shabaab terror video. ://therightscoop.com/media gleefully reporting al shabab video with trump ignores hillary and black lives matter are in it too/ … 
the worst thing hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. just watch. 
iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by obama, has wanted a way to take over saudi arabia & their oil. they just found it 
@barbaraslavin1: @ruthmarcus @washingtonpost bashing distinguished women journalists won't win you votes she is 3rd rate, a total dummy 
@tinahillstrom1: @foxnews @katrinapierson i love @piersmorgan & @realdonaldtrump real men w/ an opinion exciting interesting controversial 
.@ruthmarcus of the @washingtonpost was terrible today on face the nation.no focus, poor level of concentration but correct on hillary lying 
.@chucktodd said today on @meetthepress that attacking bill to get to hillary has never worked before. wrong attacked him in '08 & won 
does anybody remember when bill clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for hillary? she lost now bill is at it again. just watch. 

hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. if she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm 
al shabbab, not isis, just made a video on me they all will as front runner & if i speak out against them, which i must. hillary lied 
hillary clinton lied last week when she said isis made a d.t. video. the video that isis made was about her husband being a degenerate. 
just returned from mississippi a great evening. 




just arrived in mississippi for the rally. word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive. will be an amazing evening 

remember, i am self funding my campaign, the only one in either party. i'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests only the u.s.a. 
when i look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware the candidates are mere puppets $$$$ 
i hope bill clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how hillary abused those women 
hillary clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. jeb bush is a low energy individual, but hillary is not much better 
hillary clinton said that it is o.k. to ban muslims from israel by building a wall, but not o.k. to do so in the u.s. we must be vigilant 
.@jebbush is a low energy stiff who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. has no chance 
.@jebbush is a sad case. a total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on trump hit ads 
massive crowds expected in mississippi tomorrow night. look forward to it 2015 in photos: ://m.facebook.com/donaldtrump pic.twitter.com/utrl0unqau 

thank you so much to ://wnd.com  for naming me the 2015 man of the year. this is indeed a great honor for me 
the person that hillary clinton least wants to run against is, by far, me. it will be the largest voter turnout ever she will be swamped 

i will be going to mississippi tomorrow night hear the crowds are going to be massive look forward to it. 
@casuperrunner: @georgehenryw huckabee is a good man...but he needs to get behind @realdonaldtrump i agree

@ddpick18: @realdonaldtrump @jebbush @hughhewitt i get pissed off every time i see his ads on fox. waste of money go trump many do 
@nikkisue69: @realdonaldtrump @jebbush @hughhewitt jeb is such a lightweight 
@luciano031982: @realdonaldtrump veterans love trump but i love the vets even more 

.@jebbush has spent $63,000,000 and is at the bottom of the polls. i have spent almost nothing and am at the top. win @hughhewitt 

a great day in south carolina. record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm. this is now a movement to make america great again 
i predict that dying @unionleader newspaper, which has been run into the ground by publisher stinky joe mcquaid, will be dead in 2 years 
a lovely letter from the daughter of the late great john wayne. our country could use a john wayne right now. ://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/posts/10156475870665725:0 … 

i'm going to be live with @ericbolling and @kimguilfoyle to ring in the new year 2016. everybody should tune in to @foxnews tomorrow night 


i never thought i'd be saying this but i've really enjoyed @richlowry on television lately, and he was terrific hosting @seanhannity 
joe mcquaid (@deucecrew) is desperately trying to sell the @unionleader. it's a loser, and my comments haven't helped him much. 
the dying @unionleader newspaper in nh is in turmoil over my comments about them like a bully that got knocked out 

@bfb123456: @trumpiowa @playstrumpcard @realdonaldtrump wow fantastic . who knew americans were so smart? great to know we're so smart 
@hammetjohn: donaldtrump how do u do it donald. no one could keep up with u at your pace. shows how hard u will work for us as president 
@videosigninc: @realdonaldtrump keep the momentum going mr. trump. all the best to you for the new year. make america great again thanks 

iowa was fantastic last night, amazing crowd and people. i'm now in florida, getting ready to go to south carolina. big crowd, very exciting 
.@charleshurt you were great on @seanhannity last night. thanks for the nice words. make america great again 

joe mcquaid (@deucecrew) of the dying union leader wanted ads, lunches, donations, speeches from me, and tweets very unethical. 
the great people of new hampshire, who i love, are not properly served by the dying union leader newspaper. 
shows how dumb joe mcquaid (@deucecrew) of the dying union leader is to put out the letter i wrote saying why i didn't do his failed debate 


we need a real president ://www.instagram.com/p/_4w_6xghfn/  

so, i have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. jeb bush has spent $59 million & done. run country my way 
my campaign for president is $35,000,000 under budget, i have spent very little (and am in 1st place).now i will spend big in iowa/n.h./s.c. 

i will be interviewed on the @todayshow at 7:00 a.m. talking about the state of the race for president, and more. enjoy 
@billatlantaga: @realdonaldtrump @russgrand @jebbush agreed. you destroyed him with only $250k 43% 
@landmanmarius: @realdonaldtrump @russgrand @jebbush word on street is that @jebbush mother is voting @realdonaldtrump so cute 
.@jessebwatters is terrific at hosting on @foxnews he really gets it 
@russgrand: @jebbush we had your brother and father who were a disaster in office..do us a favor and drop out in favor of @realdonaldtrump 
remember that bill clinton was brought in to help hillary against obama in 2008. he was terrible, failed badly, and was called a racist 

@leemiracle3: @foxnews @charleshurt @realdonaldtrump trump listening to voters, unlike gop

@ijnipgm: no casualties. just victory, victory, and more victory as you proclaim the truth that is in your heart. we love god and usa 






strange, but i see wacko bernie sanders allies coming over to me because i'm lowering taxes, while he will double & triple them, a disaster 
wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few, and people have lost faith in our leaders.we need smart and strong leadership now 
many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. we now are part time, sad i will fix 
the middle class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of and no effective raise in years. bad 
if hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong 
@borntobegop: @realdonaldtrump we need a real president to get things done, and that's why we want you thank you. 
hopefully the republican national committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in virginia's republican party. fast 
straighten out the republican party of virginia before it is too late. stupid rnc 

@isabellegirlxo: @realdonaldtrump @jebbush @ananavarro @secupp @cnn ana is an illegal who needs to be deported no, she's just incompetent 
.@berniesanders who blew his campaign when he gave hillary a pass on her e mail crime, said that i feel wages in america are too high. lie 
@davidsadler2525: @realdonaldtrump what's going on in va? what's the gop doing? they will lose the state because of the rnc 
why are @jebbush flunkies @ananavarro and @secupp, two of the dumbest people in politics, always on the @cnn panels..and yet poll:trump 39 
the voters the republican party of virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. the dems love it be smart and win for a change 
r.p.virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. will now not allow desperately needed new voters. suicidal mistake. rnc must act now 
it begins, republican party of virginia, controlled by the rnc, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. bad 
@legacyrealtorsj: you will come out tops mr trump. you are sincere, genuine, hard working, honest and willl do what you promise the people 
@jimvitari: @realdonaldtrump @cac8438 we need the change trump is going to make, not the change obama did by ruining the country 
@cac8438: he supports amnesty and now they are so desperate that trey gowdy is going to campaign with him. 
@mitchellvii: my prediction on the trey gowdy endorsement of rubio is that it will do nothing for rubio and finish gowdy. 
@mitchellvii: face it, trey gowdy failed miserably on benghazi. he allowed it to drag out and in the end, let hillary get away with murder. 

i will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00. will be talking about hillary and far more interesting subjects. enjoy 
i will do far more for women than hillary, and i will keep our country safe, something which she will not be able to do no strength/stamina 

hillary clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but he's demonstrated a penchant for sexism, so inappropriate 
@greta: if the insurance companies are making lots of money and the # of uninsured is still large,obamacare is a failure since so expensive 
a new terror warning was issued for european cties. at what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. weak leaders 

criminal deportations in the u.s. are the lowest number in many years. we are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. must change 
the phoenix v.a., it has just been reported, is in worse shape than ever before. the wait is horrendous, and people are dying. i will fix it 
the same people that said i wouldn't run, or that i wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say i won't beat hillary. 
.@chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until i came along no ratings. i will beat hillary 


@jodil792: you know what's making my christmas great, family/food/friends&you i have my trump shirt on w/hope in my heart for america 
@jacobsac2015: @foxnews thank you for your tweet today on christmas. can't wait to see you as president, mr. trump. you are awesome. 

when will the democrats, and hillary in particular, say we must build a wall, a great wall, and mexico is going to pay for it? never 
our great veterans are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the v.a. that will stop, i will fix this quickly 
remember when failed candidate @jebbush said that illegals came across the border as an act of love? he's spent $59 million and is at 3%. 
we have many problems in our house (country ), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. make america great again 
does everyone see that the democrats and president obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. politics 
.@deedeesorvino was great today on @foxnews she gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly. have her on more 
merry christmas to all. have a great day and have a really amazing year. together, we will make america great again it will be done 
.@danielhalper great job on @cnn today. very wise indeed 
.@halliejackson why didn't you report hillary lying about the isis video. bad reporting. perhaps @nbc will do better next year but doubt it 
@yesmrgilbert: @nbcnightlynews @halliejackson should have talked to megyn kelly about this story true, a total distortion of the facts 
i am now in palm beach, florida, and will be going to church tonight. make america great again 
.@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @cnn poll where i am at 39%, 21points higher than cruz. be honest chuck 
why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @cnn poll when discussing how well i am doing instead of the older q poll? cnn even better 
wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ice to launch large scale deportation raids. it's about time 
next year will be an interesting one. i look forward to running against hillary clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly 
third rate reporters amy chozick and maggie haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the hillary circle of bias. think about bill 
wow, even lowly rand paul has just past @jebbush in the new @cnn poll. jeb is at 3%, i'm at 39%. stop throwing your money down the drain 
in the ridiculous @jebbush ad about me, jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him so sad 
poor @jebbush spent $50 million on his campaign, i spent almost nothing. he's bottom (and gone), i'm top (by a lot). that's what u.s. needs 
@classyexplorer: @gatewaypundit jim you fail to mention in your cnn poll that in the gop race...trump is leading cruz 39 to 18...big detail 

@ihatematt: @realdonaldtrump why is hillary even allowed to run... she's a criminal. 
@ihatematt: @realdonaldtrump why is hillary even allowed to run... she's a criminal. good question 
hillary said i really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign. i deplore the death and destruction she caused stupidity 

hillary, when you complain about a penchant for sexism, who are you referring to. i have great respect for women. be careful 
it is hard to believe i am winning by so much when i am treated so badly by the media. new @cnn poll amazing in all categories. 21 pt. lead 
why does @foxnews give @karlrove so much airtime. he (and other fox pundits) is so biased. still thinks romney won. unfair coverage of trump 
.@foxnews treats me so badly. using old quinnipiac poll where i have a much smaller lead than the just out @cnn poll. all negative 


the hillary clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. be careful hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card. 


big news just out new @cnn poll trump 39 and leads in every major category. likeability way up. cruz 18 carson 10 rubio 10 
we need a president with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again 
it is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. sad 
when i said that hillary clinton got schlonged by obama, it meant got beaten badly. the media knows this. often used word in politics 

wow, new reuters poll just out. big lead if you want to make america great again trump 37 cruz 11 this is at the top of drudge 



jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering jeb's statements. he is really pathetic 
watching @cnn and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. boring and biased 
women defy media narrative, love trump at packed michigan rally. video: ://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/posts/10156445430005725 …pic.twitter.com/de9odwirqi 
@schoremis1: @jebbush the donald should've been named man of the year. he dominates the polls, news, talk shows & social media. maga 
@qbeacademy: well i'm at 42% and your at 3% .you know jeb you started over here you keep on moving further and further off stage. classic 
.@jebbush's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible fumbled around, incoherent. 
why doesn't @jebbush, in his ads, show my answer to his statement in the debate? 
will @jebbush, in his phony advertising campaign, show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate? 
.@jebbush just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy. will never work 
weak and low energy @jebbush, whose campaign is a disaster, is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy. 
@_msfl_: @realdonaldtrump @trumpusa16 a great patriot

@herschelwalker, thanks for your support it is very much appreciated 
getting ready to leave for michigan will be an amazing evening see you there. 
do you think that hillary clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about the video of me being used by isis. there is no video. 
thanks @andreatantaros for all of your kind words and thoughts. big progress is being made. keep up the great work 
a suicide bomber has just killed u.s. troops in afghanistan. when will our leaders get tough and smart. we are being led to slaughter 
@drudge_report: update: isis jihadists stole 'tens of thousands' of blank passports... ://yhoo.it/1qzjgko  here we go 
it's the democrats' total weakness & incompetence that gave rise to isis not a tape of donald trump that was an admitted hillary lie

getting ready to go to the great state of michigan. big crowd tonight. make america great again 
just out: trump gop debate 18,000,000. clinton democrat debate 6,700,000. and they were on major network vs. cable 
hillary said with respect to isis, we are finally where we need to be. do we want 4 more years of incompetent leadership? maga 
i demand an apology from hillary clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate. there never was a video. 
hillary said at debate isis is going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst. she made up story want apology 
very sad what happened last night at the miss universe pageant. i sold it 6 months ago for a record price. this would never have happened 
@msully65: tell this knitwit @speakerryan, the ppl want @realdonaldtrump, not him or his choice for president thts why trump has 40% 

.@jebbush today said he didn't want to be the front runner, he would rather be where he is now, 2%. that is the talk of a loser, can't win 


.@missuniverse final 3 on now. great people, great new owner @img. watch. 

it was really strange when hillary was missing from the podium last night. not very presidential 
hillary clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no isis video of me. therefore, hillary lied at the debate last night. sad 
.@jebbush was terrible on face the nation today. being at 2% and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence. a basket case 


hillary clinton lied when she said that isis is using video of donald trump as a recruiting tool. this was fact checked by @foxnews: false 

@constant4change: trump tops dem candidates on google before dem debate ://fb.me/4xlsyk4kr  

@domineeksmith: @realdonaldtrump is the best republican presidential candidate of all time. thank you. 


.@jonkarl was totally misled, and he fell for it, that hillary wants to run against me. she knows that i am her worst nightmare jon doesn't 


@tomskeet: @realdonaldtrump @gstephanopoulos haha she's not ready for the donald 

@gstephanopoulos: as @realdonaldtrump dominates the latest polls, i’ll talk to the gop frontrunner, sunday on @thisweekabc. 
.@gstephanopoulos stupidly believes that hillary wants to run against me because she said so. she says that so people believe it opposite 



president obama spends so much time speaking of the so called carbon footprint, and yet he flies all the way to hawaii on a massive old 747. 
see, sanders backed hillary on e mails at the debate, hurting himself, and then she threw him under the bus (but failed). disloyal person 





the last thing our country needs is another bush dumb as a rock 
.@jebbush has embarrassed himself & his family with his incompetent campaign for president. he should remain true to himself. 

weak & ineffective @jebbush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. false advertising 
i have an idea for @jebbush whose campaign is a disaster. try using your last name & don’t be ashamed of it 
.@melindadc don’t misrepresent in order to make a point. i was always tough on isis as you’ll find out after i get elected. 
.@charleshurt thanks for defending me so brilliantly against @melindadc always tough when they falsify. 
as i have been saying. only the beginning: isis suspects arrested in turkey, 150 european passports seized. ://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/posts/10156426825280725 …

i won every debate so far according to all debate polls including @drudge_report, @time @slate and more. too bad dopey @megynkelly lies 
between iraq war monger @krauthammer, dummy @karlrove, deadpan @georgezwill, highly overrated @megynkelly, among others, @foxnews not fair 
i am in trump international hotel, las vegas, getting ready and waiting for the debate tonight. look forward hope i get treated fairly 
i wonder if @megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight. no matter how well i do bad 
.@megynkelly is very bad at math. she was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and cruz in the new monmouth poll 41to14. 
.@megynkelly, the most overrated anchor at @foxnews, worked hard to explain away the new monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead. she said 15 
why isn't anyone using the @cnn iowa poll with me having a big lead. they only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place).dishonest press 
isn't it amazing that @cnn paid a fortune for an iowa poll, which shows me in first place over cruz by 13%, 33% to 20% then doesn't use it 
wow, i just had two very good iowa polls and a phenomenal just out national poll from @abc @washingtonpost 38%. make america great again 

@piersmorgan: donald trump vs hillary clinton would be the greatest presidential battle in history. 
@ladykellliberty: @anncoulter i'm in pa near pburgh. dad will register to vote first time for trump. mom is changing from d to r

people have got to stop working to be so politically correct and focus all of their energy on finding solutions to very complex problems 

@lesgartcpa: @jaketapper @realdonaldtrump problem is i never watched you until trump started giving you interviews and ratings on cnn. 

@jpmorgan2016: trump needs his own poll a real poll, in every state. these polls are so ridiculous.the media will only get worse from here 
@1rdgreenberg: @foxnews that's why, after your interview, i couldn't watch the panel discussion, which is usually my favorite segment. 
@energy43: @schnoepoe @foxnews not so much fairness as it is about ratings . megan kellys hate nightly of trump is turn off for fox 
i was disappointed that ted cruz would speak behind my back, get caught, and then deny it. well, welcome to the wonderful world of politics 
i did interview with chris wallace of @foxnews in order to be fair. he then puts on rove, lane and will, three trump bashers, to discuss. 
@theprodigy3d: everyone vote for @realdonaldtrump and no he did not pay me for this endorsement. 
@schnoepoe: @foxnews i find myself more and more drawn to cnn for fairness regarding @realdonaldtrump the fox news sunday pundits a joke 
@vylvisaker: @anncoulter trump has stamina, he is working harder than any other candidate. he really loves america . he deserves to win.

@rosemarylowe105: @shahkourosh @spacemanchris @realdonaldtrump that is why we don't need a politician to be the next president. 
@straighthand: @realdonaldtrump i'd pay to watch that the donald vs hillary get ready 

@mikepetrella17: @peggynoonannyc i agree with trump. record turnouts . there's a lot of potential voters that trump is tapping into. 
chris wallace @fox at 10:00 a.m.

.@peggynoonannyc an election between hillary and myself will be the biggest voter turnout in u.s. history. just like the debates 24 m vs 2m.

if @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. the @washingtonpost scam is saving it 
the @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @jeffbezos power to screw public on low taxation of @amazon big tax shelter 
the @washingtonpost, which loses a fortune, is owned by @jeffbezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, @amazon. 
n.y.c. has the worst mayor in the united states. i hate watching what is happening with the dirty streets, the homeless and crime disgrace 
i spoke with other candidates to a jewish group, many friends, in d.c. i said i'm a negotiator like you got standing o rated best of day 
obama said in his speech that muslims are our sports heroes. what sport is he talking about, and who? is obama profiling? 
thank you graham ledger of the daily ledger @oann for your really fair coverage and your great interview with peter roff of u.s. news & w.r. 

@wiggintonrandy: @realdonaldtrump he will never say it, therefore he will never have a solution 
well, obama refused to say (he just can't say it), that we are at war with radical islamic terrorists. 
should have gone after the oil years ago (like i have been saying). 
wish obama would say isis, like almost everyone else, rather than isil. 
is that all there is? we need a new president fast 
@homefreeee: @realdonaldtrump he needs to stop all visas not look at them 
@jfk4701: @realdonaldtrump he is reading off the teleprompter. but that is o.k. in this case.

so, how did i do on face the nation? 
watch face the nation will be on now 
hillary just said that she will not use the term radical islamic but was incapable of saying why. she is afraid of obama & the e mails 

@jsears68: poll numbers will go up even more for @realdonaldtrump after obama's 'address' 
@dr_tweedy: @cnn @johnkasich kasick message is as muddled and stagnant as his political career. lied about trump crowd. media he lied 
i will be interviewed on face the nation @cbsnews at 10:30 a.m. should be interesting enjoy 
was going to do a phoner this morning with @jaketapper on @cnn but they could not get their phone equipment to hook in. will do next week.

going to columbus, ohio today for a tremendous rally of thousands. the silent majority is no longer silent 
.@ap has one of the worst reporters in the business @jeffhorwitz wouldn’t know the truth if it hit him in the face. 
.@ap continues to do extremely dishonest reporting. always looking for a hit to bring them back into relevancy—ain’t working 
.@matthewjdowd thank you for the nice comments recently, especially on @barbarajwalters. my family & i greatly appreciate your kind words. 
hillary clinton is weak on illegal immigration, among many other things. she is strong on corruption corruption is what she's best at 

@ktd101551: @cnnpolitics trump gave a great speech in ala. what's more important a protester? i wouldn't give these folks 1 sec of attn 
@jrpantiques: @realdonaldtrump @thefix @pbump the script for a great world changing leader to arise has been written & it was for mr. trump 
@bloggerjulie: @foxnews the reporter is the one who mentioned the national database first and not donaldtrump. y not report honest news? 
@mjp1370: @realdonaldtrump @thefix @pbump we need trump now obama isn't protecting americans 

@drewtheg: trump is the epitome of integrity, good spirit, forthright honesty... you pull no punches and call a spade a spade. diggin it

i didn't suggest a database a reporter did. we must defeat islamic terrorism & have surveillance, including a watch list, to protect america 
under our president, isis is gaining great strength ://instagram.com/p/ uaerumhxv/

.@mkhammer, a fox contributor, isn't smart enough to know what is going on at the border. @thejuanwilliams made the point far better 
going to south carolina now, great place, sro crowd. iowa was amazing yesterday 
the media must denigrate isis at all levels or youth will continue to be drawn to it. these are low level degenerates, not masterminds 
the media must immediately stop calling isis leaders masterminds. call them instead thugs and losers. young people must not go into isis 


john kasich was managing director of lehman brothers when it crashed, bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. a total failure 
once john kasich announced he was running for president, and opened his mouth, people realized he was a complete & total dud 
john kasich fell right into president obama’s trap on obamacare, and the people of ohio are suffering for it. shame 
doesn’t help kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else he’s almost last. 
john kasich ad guy wanted to work for me, but his proposal was a rip off – i said no now ripping kasich. 
i loved beating john kasich in the debates, but it was easy—he came in dead last 
kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in new hampshire and his numbers have gone down. people from nh are smart 
watch kasich squirm if he is not truthful in his negative ads i will sue him just for fun 
i want to do negative ads on john kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that i don’t want to waste my money. 
john kasich, despite being governor of ohio, is losing to me in the ohio polls. pathetic 
john kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me. 
governor kasich, whose failed campaign & debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me.

.@seanhannity carly, whose campaign is dead, is making false statements about me in order to salvage hope sad.

.@carlyfiorina ben carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper & pathological disease. i didn’t say it, he did. apology? 
.@carlyfiorina carly—i did graduate from wharton and did very well. who is your fact checker? will you apologize?

we, as a country, either have borders or we don't. if we don't have borders, we don't have a country 
why wouldn't the @wsj call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong. no wonder it is doing poorly 
when and how are the dummies at the @wsj going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect editorial on me. i want smart trade deals. 
the @wsj editorial board is so wrong, so often. they got info from an incorrect story in another pub. why not watch and listen to debate. 
.@wsj editorial board should review my debate statement re china and t.p.p. and apologize. china not part but will get their way in later. 
today's @wsj editorial is wrong again. i know that china is not in the new t.p.p. trade deal but would come in latter through a back door.

@bmw_e38forever: @realdonaldtrump so let it be written, so lets get him elected in a landslide victory in 2016 ://twitter.com/bmw_e38forever/status/663075298070532096/photo/1pic.twitter.com/v6fxxefsvd  
@realcinders2: @realdonaldtrump use snl to tell hispanics you are for them , you want them to have jobs and be here legally great idea 









they are saying that tickets to tonight's saturday night live are the hardest to get in the history of this great show off to a good start 

@live5news: live from new york, donald trump will soon be hosting 'snl': ://shout.lt/bhzc9  frazier, enjoy the show and best wishes 
@socialinnewyork: we unearthed donald trump's vine account from 2013 and it's incredible ://dld.bz/dzcfw  thank you. 
saturday night live has some incredible things in store tonight. the great thing about playing myself is that it will be authentic enjoy 
.@robertgbeckel please thank your brother for his nice words on television. seems like a great guy and character @cnn 
@essygalloway: @realdonaldtrump @nbcsnl @sia i can't wait to watch snl tomorrow. a really big show 



would be nice if @jmartnyt learned how to read the polls before writing his next story. probably done on purpose, but not good reporting 
@billkristol has become a sad case. his magazine is failing badly, probably doesn't have long to go, and his predictions are always wrong 
@fbeadon: @realdonaldtrump don't let the keystone pipeline die. the us needs to be good neighbors with canada, and energy independent. 


so sad that obama rejected keystone pipeline. thousands of jobs, good for the environment, no downside 
happy birthday to the great @billygraham. he's done so many wonderful things, not the least of which is his fantastic family. i love billy 
@swargcoming: @anncoulter @rushlimbaugh @greta @oann @foxnews is carson hallucinating? now lies about westpoint? ://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/ben carson west point 215598 … 
@bob_forbes2: donaldtrump has built a lifetime reputation of doing what he says he will do. he keeps his promises. ://twitter.com/donaldjtrump016/status/662690234459557888 … 



@bigsampolkcoga: @govchristie @mikehuckabeegop @foxbusiness and they kept rand paul on the main stage. let's get huck and christie back. 

@borntobegop: @realdonaldtrump @robostop10 @politico how anyone could see him as president baffles me. lies and insane theories. 
@captainmark_: @robostop10 keep it comming trump people need to be warned about that carson figure who is not who they think 
getting ready for @nbcsnl commercial.pic.twitter.com/ashecyfbrv 
@robostop10: @realdonaldtrump this is not good. ://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/ben carson west point 215598 … wow, one of many lies by ben carson big story. 

.@ajdelgado13 thank you so much for the nice words and support really enjoy listening to your ideas and thoughts. 
i think it would be a good idea—and fair—to include @govchristie & @mikehuckabeegop in the debate. both solid & good guys. @foxbusiness 
carson now admits his friend named bob, who he tried to stab (bob was saved by his belt buckle ), no longer exists as bob. wrong name 
with ben carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and pyramids built for grain storage don't people get it? 

florida ethics commission advocate comes down hard on rubio. so do two people who worked with him. said he used the wrong credit card sure. 
@rhinostate: .@realdonaldtrump @grundleman27 rubio is a manchurian candidate. people will own him if he ever became president. 
@aliceengle3: @realdonaldtrump huge lead in reuters national poll ://polling.reuters.com/# poll/tr130/type/smallest/filters/party_id_:2/dates/20150808 20151103/collapsed/false/spotlight/1 …

@rick_sa: @greta interesting presidential race; carson tries to beat his mom with a hammer, and @realdonaldtrump beats carson in the polls 
@deemcna: @foxnews silent majority did not try to kill their mothers, like ben carson, but wants america rebuilt by only one capable:trump 
a great honor to easily finish first in the @foxnews poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner 



@sandrajenners: i love to see the respect you have shown to your parents, siblings and children. proven respect and class needed in usa 
the carson story is either a total fabrication or, if true, even worse trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend 

rubio lied about my meeting w/ hispanic activists. i didn’t change my opinion but treated them w/ respect. shame ://www.rubioamnestyplan.com  
@marklindsay78: @hanan_khan2 @realdonaldtrump poll numbers are higher then most think, no one is asking democrats if they are voting trump 
@teamspringsteen: @realdonaldtrump i just finished reading crippled america. it's a detailed blueprint to get america back on track. 
@nottaliberal: @realdonaldtrump @destiny @seanhannity no need, everyone knows jeb is full of blank. 
@curtismuddog: @destiny @seanhannity jeb's whole campaign is fueled by lies. just like his brother lied about iraq. bush dynasty=lies 
.@seanhannity should have corrected jeb bush when he said that i ran for president twice. never ran, merely considered running 

@lizzym420: @amrightnow @realdonaldtrump what other candidate begins to rival trump in his knowledge, breadth of issues, stamina? thanks 
@destiny: why didn't @seanhannity correct jeb when he said @realdonaldtrump has run 4 president 2x b4~jeb needs 2b corrected b/c he lied. 
@spiritofshiloh: carson has the worst health plan ever re: soc sec and medicare. @realdonaldtrump he wants to abolish medicare no way 
jeb bush just said about marco rubio, he's my friend pure political speak. why can't he be truthful and say disloyal guy, no friend 



just landed in new hampshire a very exciting morning planned 
isn't it terrible that @megynkelly used a poll not used before (i.b.d.) when i was down, but refuses to use it now when i am up? 



@lestudio1: donald trump crippled america the new book by @realdonaldtrump is best seller in the making.

@realollietaylor: @realdonaldtrump @freedomr@oann trump is the only one who can make america great again. carson's sleepy, jeb low energy.

@tdavistonya: @brucedhendrix @poetry4bitcoin nope. trump isn't taking 2 weeks off to promote his book. trump is donating all to charity

@truth_or_rumor: @realdonaldtrump it's not so much that iran made a good deal, it's that kerry and obama gave away the store. o.k. 

@henrythezebra: @realdonaldtrump america needs you to start your 8 year shift a bit early to start fixing this disaster.

i will be on sirius xm radio, national news show, at 7:30 a.m. (monday) hosted by the great steve bannon. @breitbartnews 

while in politics it is often smart to send out false messages, one thing is clear: that hillary does not want to run against trump. 

if jeb bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with marco in the debate. bad facts for marco if properly delivered 
marco rubio will not win. weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a lightweight . 
i told you in speeches months ago that jeb and marco do not like each other. marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to jeb as his mentor 
jeb's new slogan jeb can fix it . i never thought of jeb as a crook stupid message, the word fix is not a good one to use in politics 
anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for marco rubio read this: ://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2015/10/31/marco rubios new billionaire backer top funder open borders/ … 
further proof that gang of eight member marco rubio is weak on illegal immigration is paul singer's, mr. amnesty, endorsement.rubs can't win 
@bellicwolf: @and_is_w anyway, for me the most original costume was donald trump like president 
@michael_0000: [first vote news video | mike tyson endorses donald trump for president] ://gla.news/2015/10/first vote news video mike tyson endorses donald trump for president/ … thanks mike

@katyturnbc: this is the most focused trump stump i've heard really drilling down on vets issues here in virginia. 
.@thehill john oliver had his people call to ask me to be on his very boring and low rated show. i said no thanks waste of time & energy 
few people know that @fortunemagazine is still in business. tell your writer alisa soloman that i left the apprentice to run for president 

@borderwall: floridian here i quit watching debates years ago & most tv except gator football until you decided to run for president 
@sean_in_nh: @realdonaldtrump @realollietaylor so true. in all previous debates, no one watched and they were cancelled 


@jodil792: @realdonaldtrump i wouldn't be watching at all honestly

@realollietaylor: @realdonaldtrump no one would have watched the debates if trump had not been in them 
@rketeltas: @realdonaldtrump has won all three debates and all that matters is that trump supporters know that & will vote trump thanks 
@shawnslawns4u: @terrykimk93 @wsj this coming election is the most important presidential election in my lifetime vote for trump 
@danlifting: @realdonaldtrump i wouldn't watch it at all if mr. trump was not on it. see u on your book signing on 11/3. trump all the way. 

no complaints but how many people would be watching these really dumb but record setting debates if i wasn't in them? interesting question 
@terrykimk93: @realdonaldtrump @wsj go trump go vote trump 
thank you james freeman of the @wsj for the very nice words. all polls said i won the debate except nbc (3rd). explain to daniel henninger

lifting off right now for u.s.s. wisconsin in norfolk. see ya' 
i told you so @politico just lost it's top person. poor results and no money to pay him. if they were legit, they would be doing far better 
i am leaving for norfolk, virginia the great battleship u.s.s. wisconsin for a big rally and really big crowd. see you soon 
i see marco rubio just landed another billionaire to give big money to his superpac, which are total scams. marco must address him as sir 

black lives matter protesters totally disrupt hillary clinton event. she looked lost. this is not what we need with isis, china, russia etc. 
@dalva1616: so true vote @realdonaldtrump and have america greatness back to where it belongs : the united states of america. 

i am going to save medicare and medicaid, carson wants to abolish, and failing candidate gov. john kasich doesn't have a clue weak 
when candidate john kasich, on the @oreillyfactor, talked about dismantling medicare and medicaid, he was referring to ben carson.

.@theeconomist poll, one of the most highly respected, was just released. wow, wait until the media digests these numbers won't be happy 
i'm sure the media will not report the highly respected new national poll that just came out via the economist. 32% ://today.yougov.com/news/2015/10/28/trump leads nationally ahead gop third debate/ … 

@vaporcon2015: @realdonaldtrump the liberals are terrified that you'll be the one to go against hillary. 
@cmrose111: @realdonaldtrump @cnbc get your polls straight. trump is going to win. he is the only one tough enough to run this country. 
@mozarttaig1: @cnbc is trying to drive down poll numbers to install carson who the establishment gop will promptly roll. win don win 
does anybody think that @cnbc will get their fictitious polling numbers corrected sometime prior to the start of the debate. sad 
@1barbara1: @realdonaldtrump @morning_joe @politico i watched the entire rally and trump was very well received the place was packed. 
.@morning_joe can you believe kasie hunt's poor and purposely inaccurate reporting on my great night and crowd in iowa. @politico is a scam 
.@cnbc continues to report fictious poll numbers. number one, based on every statistic, is trump (by a wide margin). they just can't say it

@laura_damron: @foxnews @realdonaldtrump this hispanic woman believes trump has the brains & energy to make america great again . 
@rickst. how many msm outlets will carry a clip of @realdonaldtrump leaving the podium to enter a crowd & listen to the concerns of a vet?

@rketeltas: @realdonaldtrump at least the real frontrunner is actually campaigning in iowa and not on book tours. trump 2016 

@faagifts: @oann wtg, great job. u r the best pick out of all of the candidates & ohio knows this 2.that is why u r leading there too 
i am leaving for sioux city, iowa great event (rally).

thank you @sahilkapur for the wonderful story. ://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015 10 27/why donald trump could win the republican nomination … 

@rhatpatriot: @foxbusiness @realdonaldtrump why not post the other polls where trump has 40 percent and carson is in the teens? strange? 
@bawl: i agree @billkristol hasn't be right about anything in a very long time. shocking that @morning_joe gives him a platform. 
@jordandworaczyk: @drhawk12 @elvisknievil i'm voting for @realdonaldtrump too. thanks. 

@albertomarsano: @realdonaldtrump looking forward to seeing you in reno nevada this thursday nevada stands with you nice. 
@thejusticeengle: @realdonaldtrump i'm 18 years old from florida, and just registered to vote. you got my vote in the primaries thanks. 

@bobd746847: there shouldn't be a problem with this election. we the people finally have someone that speaks on our behalf. trump 2016 
@coloradojoe2001: how is any one taking carson seriously when he suspends his presidential campaign for a book signing tour? 
dopey @billkristol, who has lost all credibility with so many dumb statements and picks, said last week on @morning_joe that biden was in. 

all presidential candidates should immediately disavow their super pac’s. they're not only breaking the spirit of the law but the law itself 
re super pac scam: what the other candidates are doing is a disgrace. 
this whole super pac scam is very unfair to a person like me who has disavowed all pac's & is self funding. 

@hoosierclinger: good job @realdonaldtrump for badgering ford. why didnt potus or hillary care about those uaw jobs in ohio? 
@maria_heck: @robertsliardon @realdonaldtrump. the more i hear trump the more i like him 
@dansaltsman: @realdonaldtrump @ford @crainsdetroit @detnews @cnbc ://bit.ly/1lq6nv4  do you think hillary, ben or jeb could do this? 
ben carson wants to abolish medicare i want to save it and social security. 

leaving for new hampshire now. will be doing the @todayshow there, live at 7:00 a.m. new @cbsnews poll of new hampshire: trump 38 carson 12 

remember that carson, bush and rubio are very weak on illegal immigration. they will do nothing to stop it. our country will be overrun 
@rketeltas: @realdonaldtrump bush appears to be low on cash may need to do drop out or perhaps get a loan from hillary. 

@mmolina44: @realdonaldtrump @byronyork @cbsnews @cnn donald trump will be our next president of the united states. 

@jfgrcar: @realdonaldtrump gentle ben is no match for putin or if the truth be told even for hilary. usa needs a winner. 
do you think i will get credit for keeping ford in u.s. who cares, my supporters know the truth. think what can be done as president 
word is that ford motor, because of my constant badgering at packed events, is going to cancel their deal to go to mexico and stay in u.s. 
@obfuscateclear: wow, imagine what he'll do as president. thanks @realdonaldtrump ://twitter.com/blisstabitha/status/658378957071319040 … ford listened to me, great

does everyone remember @mittromney and his famous remarks about self deportation and 47% . he was done. i don't need his angry advice 
.@mittromney and his campaign manager should not be critical of candidates after they blew an election that should never have been lost 
.@mittromney can only speak negatively about my presidential chances because i have been openly hard on his terrible choke loss to obama 

.@foxnewssunday 
jeb, why did your brother attack and destabalize the middle east by attacking iraq when there were no weapons of mass destruction? bad info? 
this morning chris wallace has the best political show on television but that's only because i'm on it (kidding) have fun. 
jeb bush should stop trying to defend his brother and focus on his own shortcomings and how to fix them. also, rubio is hitting him hard 
on at 9:00a.m. or 10:00 a.m. (depending on your location) on fox is a tough but really good interview with chris wallace. enjoy

@shlomo_abaddon: @todayshow @mlauer @realdonaldtrump matt will vote for trump i just know he will 
@joeyl3rd: @foxandfriends @erictrump grt interview, i'm telling ya, @realdonaldtrump children r going 2 b a huge asset 2 him & his campaign 
.@erictrump was fantastic on @foxandfriends this morning. he may be my son but he is a special guy 
.@cnbc has just agreed that the debate will be two hours. fantastic news for all, especially the millions of people who will be watching 
@lance_combrink: @realdonaldtrump karl rove still thinks romney won. why is he still on tv? 
@hohummm: did you also hear megyn say carson is the front runner ...according so some polls ..tied in other polls outright lie hatred 
@rickstans1: donald, megyn kelly seeks ratings, not truth not much of a journalist. stay focused & make your own narrative. it's working 
every poll, time, drudge, slate and others, said i won both debates but heard megyn kelly had her two puppets say bad stuff. i don't watch 
.@marcthiessen is a failed bush speechwriter whose work was so bad that he has never been able to make a comeback. a third rate talent 

megyn kelly has two really dumb puppets, chris stirewalt & marc threaten (a bushy) who do exactly what she says. all polls say i won debates 
@redscarebot: @brandongordy1: @realdonaldtrump is what we millennials need. i used to support that socialist from vt, what a mistake. 
@bigmikeobrien: @erictrump @skyjones55 @greta @foxnews @oreillyfactor @carlrove is in the tank for bush we are tired of the establishment 

@davidaxelrod: .met @ivankatrump a few years back. donaldtrump is wise to enlist his daughter's help. she's a throughly impressive person. 
will be on @bloombergtv tomorrow with @sruhle. enjoy 

.@cnbc is pushing the @gop around by asking for extra time (and no criteria) in order to sell more commercials. 
the @gop should not agree to the ridiculous debate terms that @cnbc is asking unless there is a major benefit to the party. 

a great day in new jersey for trump ://on.wsj.com/1ofz0zu  & ://on.app.com/1gigth0

the debate last night proved that hillary is running against the “b” team. she won’t be so lucky when it comes to me 
we need a strong leader and fast ://instagram.com/p/80rwsdght0/  

like her or not, hillary did what she had to do in the debate last night—get through it. her opponents were very gentle and soft 
the latest book on hillary—wow, a really tough one ://www.amazon.com/dp/151070678x  @rogerjstonejr 
@releafpen: dem debate message summary = more free handouts. they will be voting in droves. we need to get out and vote trump big time

@julieruot: i want a president who believes all lives matter and that is why we need @realdonaldtrump. 
sorry, there is no star on the stage tonight 
good move by bernie s. 
the hardest thing clinton has to do is defend her bad decision making including iraq vote, e mails etc. 
all are very scripted and rehearsed, two (at least) should not be on the stage. 
@achilarre: i couldn't even imagine the bloodbath that would ensue if the @realdonaldtrump debated any one of these five jabronis

@laurenda123: @realdonaldtrump i think @jebbush and @marcorubio are supposed to be on this stage 

@rjdicksii: @realdonaldtrump. these cats are like bad used car salesmen. 

@maxxgadog: @lindasuhler @realdonaldtrump if you got rid of commercials you would have nothing worth watching 

o'malley, as former mayor of baltimore, has very little chance. 
can anyone imagine chafee as president? no way. 
@tr3s3can: @realdonaldtrump @realdonaldtrump make america great again would not even watch dem debate except donald is tweeting about it

@hapearce1: @realdonaldtrump they need to take the debate slow, a lot of low energy on the stage tonight. i hope not 
@streckerjosh: the hillary love fest on cnn is ridiculous. i feel bad for the other candidates...especially the non criminal ones. 
@xai7126: @greta i'd rather see @realdonaldtrump be the debate moderator 
should be interesting but too bad the three guys at《1% will be taking up so much time but who knows, maybe a star will be born (unlikely)

heading to a packed house in waterloo, iowa will celebrate today's great poll numbers together. see you soon 
if stuart stevens' book is as bad as his horrible political advice to mitt romney, don't waste your money. arrogant guy but a zero

i am attracting the biggest crowds, by far, and the best poll numbers, also by far. much of the media is totally dishonest. so sad 
i have been leading big in all polls, with two more today, @nbc and @cnn. the nbc poll is more than double next, at 29%. fiorina has 11%. 
there is no way that carly fiorina can become the republican nominee or win against the dems. boxer killed her for senate in california

if someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president, do you really think he would come to my rescue? no chance 
this is the first time in my life that i have caused controversy by not saying something. 
am i morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? i don't think so

the polls are really looking good—#1 everywhere despite all lobbyist & special interest $ being spent against me. i’m turning down millions. 
everyone is talking about the incredible event we had in dallas last night. spectacular crowd & arena thank you @mcuban. 
.@club4growth asked me for $1 million. i said no. now falsely advertising that i will raise taxes. i’ll lower big league for middle class. 
my plan will lower taxes for our country, not raise them. phony @club4growth says i will raise taxes—just another lie. 
little respected club for growth asked me for $1,000,000 i said no . now they are spending lobbyist and special interest money on ads 
am now in l.a. will be going to the u.s.s. iowa at 5:30 p.m. to speak to our great veterans and other friends

@doctr__wang @cnn nice i love how trump has a way of putting people on the spot. i wonder what cnn will do. the veterans appreciate it 
why is someone like george pataki, who did a terrible job as governor of n.y. and registers zero in the polls, allowed on the debate stage? 




@daveinkeno: mr. trump, sir, this country is, and has been, on a path of self destruction and needs you to make america great again 
@joeearle: @pistol044 there's only one i'll never support: @realdonaldtrump 
@edward1:trump knows how to get things done. he has guts to say what needs to be said. he'll deal with putin more effectively than anyone. 


i am having a great time in iowa at jack trice stadium unbelievable people. 
too many people on stage for debate. @randpaul at 11th, with 2% in @realclearnews, shouldn't be allowed to participate. 
i truly understood the appeal of ron paul, but his son, @randpaul, didn't get the right gene. 
lightweight senator @randpaul should focus on trying to get elected in kentucky a great state which is embarrassed by him.

oh wow, lightweight governor @bobbyjindal, who is registered at less than 1 percent in the polls, just mocked my hair. so original 
also, tomorrow night i will be going to boone and ames. really look forward to seeing all of my friends in iowa. 

i will be on the tonight show with jimmy fallon tonight at 11:30. should be fun @jimmyfallon 
.... i only respond to people that register more than 1% in the polls. i never thought he had a chance and i’ve been proven right. 
bobby jindal did not make the debate stage and therefore i have never met him…. 

i'll be on @greta on the record tonight at 7 pm 
wow, i am ahead of the field with evangelicals (am so proud of this) and virtually every other group, and ben carson just took a swipe at me 
i had a great day in d.c. even though the subject was an unpleasant one, the horrible iran nuke deal. amazing crowd and enthusiasm 
man did jeb throw his brother under the bus last night on @colbertlateshow . probably true, but not nice 


see you in d.c. tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. at the capitol to protest the horribly negotiated deal with iran. really sad

the lobbyists & special interests have just put out an ad for jeb which hits me just a little but is very false 
i’m self funding my campaign but lobbyists & special interests for jeb & others are starting to do big ads—desperate don’t believe them.

tomorrow in dc: 1 pm west front lawn of the capitol. not even believable that we would do this deal with iran. 
look forward to being in dc tomorrow—big crowd expected for our protest against the truly stupid nuclear deal we are making with iran. 
looking forward to being with @sentedcruz at our big rally in d.c. on wednesday (1:00 p.m. at the capitol) to protest insane iran nuke deal 
both washington d.c. and dallas are turning out to be really big events. d.c. is protest of incompetent iran deal and dallas is big speech 
remember, i'll see you in d.c. at the capitol building on wednesday at 1:00 o'clock. then dallas on sept.14 at 6:00 p.m. american air center

the dallas event on september 14 at 6:00 p.m. at the american airlines center looks like it will be a giant success. tickets are going fast 
our country needs a president with great leadership skills and vision, not someone like hillary or barack, neither of which has a clue 
the phony club for growth, which asked me in writing for $1,000,000 (i said no), is now wanting to do negative ads on me. total hypocrites

the hedge fund guys (gals) have to pay higher taxes asap. they are paying practically nothing. we must reduce taxes for the middle class 
by self funding my campaign, i am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists. i am only working for the people of the u.s. 
remember that i am self funding my campaign. hillary, jeb and the rest are spending special interest and lobbyist money.100% controlled 
hillary said such nasty things about me, read directly off her teleprompter...but there was no emotion, no truth. just can't read speeches 
hillary clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter i have ever seen. in fact, it wasn't even see through glass, it was black 
saudi arabia was vehemently against the iran nuclear deal. then today they embraced it. what happened? what did we give them to endorse? 
wow, the dallas event in two weeks looks like a big winner get your tickets (american airlines center) fast 
just announced that because of trump , advertising rates for debate on @cnn are going from $5000 to $200,000, a 4000% increase.pay charity? 
why would a very low ratings radio talk show host like hugh hewitt be doing the next debate on @cnn. he is just a 3rd rate gotcha guy 
very low ratings radio host hugh hewitt asked me about suleiman, abu bake al baghdad, hassan nasrallah and more typical gotcha questions 
the dallas event in two weeks, at the american airlines center, is filling up fast. get your tickets fast, before it is too late

the deal with iran will go down as one of the most incompetent ever made. the u.s. lost on virtually every point. we just don't win anymore

@lbabcock2: @oreillyfactor @foxnews i have always wondered why fox kept rove on after his disastrous election predictions. he is a joke 
@gulfportedd: @realdonaldtrump jeb bush couldn't shine mr trumps shoes...give me a break. bushes are so over... 

when i intelligently turned down the club for growth crazy request for $1,000,000, they got nasty.what a waste of money that would have been 
the president of the pathetic club for growth came to my office in n.y.c. and asked for a ridiculous $1,000,000 contribution. i said no way 


every poll has me winning big.if you listen to dopey karl rove, a trump hater, on @oreillyfactor, you would think i'm doing poorly. @foxnews 
why does @oreillyfactor and @foxnews always have karl rove on. he spent $430 million and lost all races. a dope who said romney won election 
i’m turning down millions of dollars of campaign contributions—feel totally stupid doing so, but hope it is appreciated by the voters. 
many super pacs, funded by groups that want total control over their candidate, are being formed to “attack” trump. remember when u see them 
no more clintons or bushes ://instagram.com/p/7gxcgxghbg/  
congrats everyone we topped 4 million today on twitter and heading up fast 
while millions are being spent against me in attack ads, they are paid for by the “bosses” and “owners” of candidates. i am self funding. 
jeb is spending millions of dollars on “hit” ads funded by lobbyists & special interests. bad system. 
yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign. will jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me? 

the just released public policy polling (ppp national result) is the best yet. make america great again 
@highwayhopper66: @conniemackiv @00patriot my wife and i are both voting for trump in florida over our previous governor period thank you 

just out new ppp national poll has me in first place by a wide margin at 29%. i wonder why only @foxnews has not reported this? too bad 
150 clinton e mails still contain classified information. more sensitive when she was sec.of state. this is a very big deal. 
president obama wants to change the name of mt. mckinley to denali after more than 100 years. great insult to ohio. i will change back

.@governorpataki did a terrible job as governor of new york. if he ran again, he would have lost in a landslide. he and graham zero in polls 
jeb bush just talked about my border proposal to build a fence. it's not a fence, jeb, it's a wall, and there's a big difference 
asians are very offended that jeb said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics. a mess 
in a clumsy move to get out of his anchor babies dilemma, where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it, he blamed asians 
jeb bush never uses his last name on advertising, signage, materials etc. is he ashamed of the name bush? a pretty sad situation. go jeb 
@patrickstinard: @megynkelly kelly file was much better without megyn kelly. her replacement while she was out on vacation was much better

.@megynkelly must have had a terrible vacation, she is really off her game. was afraid to confront dr. cornel west. no clue on immigration

@zephyrusmatrix: will you finally get respect for predicting u.s. concerns even weeks before disaster strikes.the country needs a visionary 
markets are crashing all caused by poor planning and allowing china and asia to dictate the agenda. this could get very messy vote trump. 

as i have long stated, we are so tied in with china and asia that their markets are now taking the u.s. market down. get smart u.s.a. 
new reuters poll just came out and has me at 32%, highest number yet.the silent majority is back and we will make america great again 
the last thing we need is another bush in the white house. would be the same old thing (remember read my lips, no more taxes ). greatness 
jeb bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body. jeb just can't get it right 
jeb bush is weak on illegal immigration, in favor of common core, bad on women's health issues and thinks the iraq war was a good thing. 
now that i started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border, most other candidates are finally speaking up. just politicians 

how is bernie sanders going to defend our country if he can't even defend his own microphone? very sad 
thank you to the @washingtonpost for the accurate and very discriptive story on my speech in alabama last night. it was a great evening 
i had 15,000 people in phoenix but @politico said the rooms capacity is just over 2000. but said bernie sanders had 11,000 in same room. 
.@politico covers me more inaccurately than any other media source, and that is saying something. they go out of their way to distort truth 
@dojiedojie: @realdonaldtrump keep talking donald....the people want to hear it loud and clear 

alabama was great last night, amazing people. 30,000 folks was largest crowd of political season. nice 
.@jessebwatters, you did a great job hosting @oreillyfactor. everybody loved it thank you for the nice words. 

dow dives more than 500 points down 9% from high. be careful 
leaving for mobile, alabama, right now can't be late 
boston incident is terrible. we need energy and passion, but we must treat each other with respect. i would never condone violence.

how crazy 7.5% of all births in u.s. are to illegal immigrants, over 300,000 babies per year. this must stop. unaffordable and not right 
jeb bush signed memo saying not to use the term anchor babies, offensive. now he wants to use it because i use it. stay true to yourself 
alabama will shine tomorrow. it will be a big and glorious day 
we are going to make our country so strong again, so great again. no more ripping off the united states. we will make america great again 
@2ndvoter: @stevehuang68 agree. one of the things that is good abt @realdonaldtrump is he's forcing others out of status quo politicking.

why is @randpaul allowed to take advantage of the people of kentucky by running for senator and pres. why should kentucky be back up plan? 
we must stop the crime and killing machine that is illegal immigration. rampant problems will only get worse. take back our country

i'm glad president obama followed my lead and lowered the flags half staff. it's about time

@dark_red_hair: .@realdonaldtrump u hit a home run on the factor 




@malibu101834: @realdonaldtrump @oreillyfactor i'll watch anything that gives you a chance to share your views. go donald. 

i will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00. will be talking about the poor treatment of our veterans, illegal immigration, etc. 
look how small the pages have become @wsj. looks like a tabloid—saving money i assume 
this story is no longer about john mccain, it’s about our horribly treated vets. illegals are treated better than our wonderful veterans. 
it was only after i informed nbc that i wouldn't do the apprentice that they became upset w/ me. they couldn’t care less about “inclusion 
@amit_ @realdonaldtrump i agree 100%. mccain is fighting for illegal immigrant but never did anything for our vets. 
@linflies @ghostdancer_2 @contrarian11 @michaelcohen212 @chriscuomo @deptvetaffairs ...rest of gop only cries but trump gets stuff done 
@valenti317 @realdonaldtrump the left is petrified of you why else would they be attacking you so vigorously? 
@mjjustus1 @andrewstilesusa @realdonaldtrump trump already hosts vets at his resorts. what does hillary do? 
@rtmatador trump says things that no one else would even consider saying, i agree with him on the immigration situation, i love honesty 
@_eod i believe we have passed that point. there are homeless veterans in usa & yet illegal aliens get government housing 

@vetapologist this is big criticism of the republican field. speak truth and stop being so pc. this is why @realdonaldtrump resonates 

we will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans. 
the ever dwindling @wsj which is worth about 1/10 of what it was purchased for, is always hitting me politically. who cares 
@rw84jr: @realdonaldtrump glad u r man enough 2 speak the truth in this pathetic politically correct world 
@jenism101: @realdonaldtrump @97musick trump is the only person we believe will actually set things right.

@97musick: @realdonaldtrump voters like tough and smart ... that's why we are voting trump 2016 
@maxchupailo: @kuuleme69 @cspan @realdonaldtrump gotta love the honesty 

@ebalky: @realdonaldtrump that's all the career politicians do is talk 
@ginaandersonrn: @realdonaldtrump ...rn for 27 yrs. veterans have less benefits than medicaid recipients. thnx for speaking#truth 
@sjbatis: @realdonaldtrump bravo for saying whats on most of americans mind. lets make america great, again 
@2014_vince: the left wing politically correct cannot handle big don giving the truth....reality....keep saying it like it is 
@pg_rant: they can't handle you donald so want you out the race, well good luck,because we know you won't walk away give it to them 
@hl3tweets: mccain epitomizes the career politicians who have gotten us into our $19 trillion train wreck, including the va debacle.

i will be making some very big campaign stops next week big crowds and tremendous energy make america great again 
the republican party must get tougher and smarter, and fast, or it will go down to a very big defeat just like the last two times 
a true piece about the standing ovations i got yesterday ://thegazette.com/subject/news/government/politics/cruz jindal trump score big at family leader gop presidential candidate event 20150719 … 
the veterans administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly. john mccain has done nothing to help them but talk. 
john mccain called thousands of people crazies when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in phoenix. he owes apology 
@mwood_79: @sharylattkisson why do they attack mr trump? because he has something they dont. the ability of truth trump is here 
@dunn_cheri: @sharylattkisson mr trump the only one telling the truth. liberals can't stand the fact that your are leading in the poll 
@amsardina: @realdonaldtrump @sharylattkisson kick there ass trump 


wow, @sharylattkisson just wrote the definitive piece on what i said about john mccain ://sharylattkisson.com/fact check the washington post on donald trump and john mccain/ … 
one of the reasons i am no fan of john mccain is that our vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians. i will fix va quickly. 
via @fitsnews: “donald trump: john mccain is ‘a loser’” ://www.fitsnews.com/2015/07/18/donald trump john mccain is a loser/#5ojkuvsh6ipd4vpu.99 … 
why would anybody listen to @mittromney? he lost an election that should have easily been won against obama. by the way,so did john mccain 
congrats to the new gov. of texas, @gregabbott_tx, for taking a tough & bold stance at the border. should have been done long ago by perry. 
i have a proven track record supporting our veterans. veterans deserve universal access to care. va scandal proves politicians are inept. 
....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care. 
it's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our veterans..... 
i will make this right for our great vets 
all he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything. 
....john mccain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for veterans to successfully manage their lives. 
the veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years... 
captured or not, all our soldiers are heroes 
in addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our vets, john mccain let us down by losing to barack obama in his run for president 
just left family leadership summit in iowa, got a standing ovation from many wonderful people. i will be back soon. 
statement on john mccain ://on.fb.me/1coy9cf  
i am now in iowa getting ready to speak. people are always amazed to find out that i am protestant (presbyterian). great. 
the $10 billion (net worth) is after all debt and liabilities. so simple to understand but @cnn & @cnnpolitics is just plain dumb 
ratings starved @cnn and @cnnpolitics does not cover me accurately. why can't they get it right it's really not that hard 
made a speech in arkansas last night before a record gop crowd. great spirit and amazing people. make america great again

....likewise, billions of dollars gets brought into mexico through the border. we get the killers, drugs & crime, they get the money 
el chapo and the mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a vacuum cleaner, sucking drugs and death right into the u.s.

who is @macys to pretend innocence when they “racial profile” all over the place? paid big fine 
interesting that @macys criticized me but just paid $650,000 in fines for racial profiling. are they racists?

i'll be in iowa tonight making a speech to a record setting crowd. the word is getting out, make america great again 
the leader and negotiators representing mexico are far smarter and more cunning than the leader and negotiators representing the u.s. 
only very stupid people think that the united states is making good trade deals with mexico.mexico is killing us at the border and at trade 
.@billmaher: bill, you are really beginning to understand what is going on with trump actually, you always knew

.@univision cares far more about mexico than it does about the u.s. are they controlled by the mexican government? 
anyone who wants strong borders and good trade deals for the us should boycott @univision. 
once again the bush appointed supreme court justice john roberts has let us down. jeb pushed him hard remember 
i love mexico but not the unfair trade deals that the us so stupidly makes with them. really bad for us jobs, only good for mexico. 
univision wants to back out of signed @missuniverse contract because i exposed the terrible trade deals that the u.s. makes with mexico. 
mexican gov doesn't want me talking about terrible border situation & horrible trade deals. forcing univision to get me to stop no way

out of hundreds of deals & transactions, i have used the bankruptcy laws a few times to make deals better. nothing personal, just business. 
almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool. icahn, black, zell—but nobody says they went bankrupt 
people buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals. it’s a very effective & commonly used business tool. 
stop saying i went bankrupt. i never went bankrupt but like many great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage—smart 

has charles @krauthammer ever apologized for being so totally wrong on iraq? i called it right in every way—make america great again 
george will was a big iraq fool. $2 trillion, thousands of lives lost & we got nothing dummy.

if the working, proud and productive people of our country don't start exerting their authority and views, the u.s. as we know it is doomed 
why is no one talking about the horrible murder of ana charle by ex con thug west spruill. gunned down on street, naked. why no riots here? 
billions of dollars spent on baltimore and it's still a total mess. leadership is needed, not dollars. our whole country is going to hell

@lynuscantwell: the world is laughing. obama is a joke. no hillary the sequel. run donald please. we need no nonsense leadership. 
@jtruelove713: if @realdonaldtrump runs for president i will vote for the first time ever. until then........... 
i wonder what the rest of the world is thinking about the united states as they watch the disgusting and out of control baltimore riots? 
hopefully there won't be any problems in baltimore tonight. be calm, be cool do not let anybody get hurt.there is just too much to live for 
the best social program, by far, is a job our jobs are being taken away from us by china and many other countries incompetent leader. 
president obama, you have a big job to do. go to baltimore and bring both sides together. with proper leadership, it can be done do it. 
our country has to come together. we have to start working with, and really liking, each other. the whole world is watching baltimore. 

the mayor of baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters space to destroy another real genius 
now that the ineffective baltimore police have allowed the city to be destroyed, are the u.s. taxpayers expected to rebuild it (again)? 
our great african american president hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying baltimore 
blatant and rampant property destruction in baltimore as the police stand by and watch. should be a lesson on how not to handle riots. sad 
wow, 15 policemen hurt in baltimore, some badly where is the national guard. police must get tough, and fast thugs must be stopped.

china has a backdoor into the trans pacific partnership. this deal does not address currency manipulation. china is laughing at us. 
the trans pacific partnership will lead to even greater unemployment. do not pass it. 
republicans should not be giving obama fast track authority on trade. the trans pacific partnership will squeeze our manufacturing sector

@hillarysusans: getting ready for next week with @realdonaldtrump on monday. @nhgop @foxnews 


.@nro @jonahnro wow, just looked at the stats for national review. dying fast, doing very little business. save this conservative voice 
@andrewwilkie85: @realdonaldtrump @smxtty_ i think that you would be as good as reagan. please run 


@stevesgoddard: @smxtty_ it would be very frightening to have president who has actually accomplished something during their life, 
@mr_president706: @realdonaldtrump please run for president, and show these so called republicans how to get the job done. 
@sam_tucker17: you would be the best president. you're political critiques are always on the money. you are way better than hillary 
@olivianuzzi: @realdonaldtrump you are amazing 
@johnmarkowitz: @realdonaldtrump you are damn good 
@faktmeister: u r 1000% correct, politicians can't fix problems politicians made. the executive branch needs a real chief executive. run 
@themightylayman: dear @realdonaldtrump: you are the most admired man in the world and everybody hopes you run for president. 
@scapesrus: @realdonaldtrump @smxtty_ u would make a damn good one 
@smxtty_: donald trump would be the greatest president thank you. 
the reason ed schultz said nice things about me is that i’m the only repub who won't cut social security, etc. i’ll make america rich again 
i’m a conservative, but the weakness of conservatives is that they destroy each other, whereas liberals unite to win. 
with a stupid guy like jonah goldberg who uses “tweeting like a 14 year old girl” to hit me, no wonder the nro is doing so poorly. @jonahnro 
people have been forced to resign positions for far less than @jonahnro’s “tweeting like a 14 year old girl” 
.@jonahnro you stated that i started “relentlessly tweeting like a 14 year old girl...” horrible insult to women. resign now or later

entrepreneurs: be tough, be smart, be personable, but don’t take things personally. that’s good business. 
entrepreneurs: don’t ever think you’ve done it all already or that you’ve done your best. you haven't so don't limit yourself 
entrepreneurs: follow your instincts and keep your focus intact. you alone know where you really want to go. 
entrepreneurs: paying attention can be a cost effective way of protecting yourself. 
entrepreneurs: look at the solution, not the problem. learn to focus on what will give results. 
entrepreneurs: keep your momentum. without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere. 
entrepreneurs: keep the big picture in mind. there are always opportunities & possibilities, and thinking too small can negate a lot of them

romney was the architect of obamacare. bush’s chief justice legalized the monstrosity. notice a trend? 

a clinton already defeated a bush. the definition of insanity is doing the same thing twice & expecting a different result.

@vikkitb: @realdonaldtrump is so right with everything he is saying run... please run for president 
isn't it interesting that immediately after september 11th, everybody was asking for, and indeed demanding, torture of any kind. no reports 

when terrorists are beheading and executing american citizens in such a brutal way,the report on torture should be the least of our concerns 
@constancemcn: @realdonaldtrump: donald, i am in love and admire you run for president in 2016 and all will be well 
the terrorists cut off the heads of americans and laugh, then want to sell us the bodies for $1,000,000. we fight over sleep deprivation

if obamacare should not be repealed then why has obama & congress exempted their staffs? 
obama is community organizing from the oval office on ferguson today. more riots sure to follow.

president obama has absolutely no control (or respect) over the african american community they have fared so poorly under his presidency.

who is the moron who decided to release the ferguson grand jury findings after 9:00 o'clock in the evening. what were they thinking? 
our country is totally fractured and, with our weak leadership in washington, you can expect ferguson type riots and looting in other places 
sadly, because president obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations 
as china and the rest of the world continue to rip off the u.s. economically, they laugh at us and our president over the riots in ferguson 
can you imagine what putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the u.s. as they watch the ferguson riot 
if the decision by the grand jury in ferguson was the exact opposite, you would still be having the riots right now 
despite having a black president, the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades.if obama were a leader, this would not be the case 
@therealzach49: this is why we need @realdonaldtrump in office. @barackobama doesn't know how to keep order 
@abdul_akbarzai1: @therealzach49: @realdonaldtrump can't wait for you to take over this country and rebuild what obama destroyed 
@d_mellette: @realdonaldtrump for president 2k16 
why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in ferguson at 9:00 in the evening a prime time for riots not smart. 
iran and the united states just pushed deadline back seven months on working out a nuclear deal. iran is tapping along our bad negotiators 
isis is starting its own currency. may be stronger than the dollar if obamacare is fully implemented. 
there is no excuse for riots in ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome. 
fact – amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness. obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform.

entrepreneurs: set the example. you can motivate others as well as yourself by remembering you are setting the example.

we spent two trillion dollars in iraq and got nothing. now we are going back and will again get nothing because our leaders are clueless

yes, i won the right to have my name taken off trump plaza in a.c. because it was not operated up to a very high standard and no involvement 
i made a fortune in atlantic city, got out years ago (great timing), and havn't been back in many years. i have nothing to do with a.c. 
with all that is happening with ebola, including the doctor who so easily came back to new york, obama still refuses to stop the flights

@bbcoachkk: @realdonaldtrump oh donald i love you 
@itbegins2012: @realdonaldtrump trump, you are great you speak your mind and should continue to do so 
president obama, you are a complete and total disaster, but you have a chance to do something great and important: stop the flights 
president obama has a major meeting on the n.y.c. ebola outbreak, with people flying in from all over the country, but decided to play golf 
i never thought i'd say it in my lifetime, but president barack hussein obama, aka barry sotoro, is a far worse president than jimmy carter 
i have been saying for weeks for president obama to stop the flights from west africa. so simple, but he refused. a total incompetent 
ebola has been confirmed in n.y.c., with officials frantically trying to find all of the people and things he had contact with.obama's fault 
if this doctor, who so recklessly flew into new york from west africa,has ebola,then obama should apologize to the american people & resign 
there is a good possibility that a person who treated patients in west africa and who flew into new york has ebola. touched many, bedlam

later today i’m being honored at the park hyatt in washington, d.c. by the wharton club. the joseph wharton award dinner. a great honor. 


i'm going to d.c. today to check on the hotel i'm building on penn. ave., and then being honored by the wharton school of finance, the best 
why are we letting the three girls, who left the u.s. to join isis, back into the country? how stupid has our once respected country become 
if there is one more ebola case in the u.s., a full travel ban will be instituted. this common sense move should have been done long ago 
@rrogers19: please save this country. @realdonaldtrump 
@beyertristen: @realdonaldtrump a man of business and success, please run for president and fix this country 
@alyssatomazin44: @realdonaldtrump seriously needs to run for president 

the united states troops which were sent to west africa have only gotten 4 hours of ebola training very unfair to them and their families 
the united states, under president obama, has truly become the gang that couldn't shoot straight. everything he touches turns to garbage 
the u.s. accidentally air dropped a large shipment of military weapons and supplies right into the middle of isis as enemy laughs very sad 
negotiation is an art. treat it like one. 
don’t believe kay hagan on ebola travel ban. she also promised that you would keep your healthcare plan under obamacare. vote @thomtillis 

i will be in washington, d.c. tomorrow to receive the 2014 joseph wharton award at the wharton club of d.c.—a great honor @wharton 
@northcutt2013: @realdonaldtrump @mrkenbutler no, he can't and will not run. great man yes, not worth the mud slinging don't be so sure

oscar pistorious will likely only serve 10 months for the cold blooded murder of his girlfriend. another o.j. travesty.the judge is a moron

i don't know if president obama isn't stopping the flights from ebola torn west africa because he is stubborn, stupid, or just doesn't care 
here we go a healthcare worker who treated thomas duncan, the man who flew into the u.s. from west africa infected with ebola, caught it 
president obama, now, bring our 4000 innocent and ill trained soldiers home from west africa, before it is too late, and stop the flights 

@billyhaze: great interview tuesday past with jim gardner, must be a breath of fresh air speaking with such a well respected journalist 
remember when i said when saddam hussein fell the new leader of iraq will be meaner and tougher and hate the u.s. even more. welcome isis 
if a conservative republican made the mistake that mrs. obama just made by calling braley by the wrong name, it would be the biggest story 
michelle obama made a terrible mistake in iowa. when endorsing bruce braley before a large crowd, she called him bruce bailey seven times. 
isn't it ridiculous, starting today, new ebola screenings go into effect for people coming from west africa. just stop the flights dummies

i'm not going to be watching much nfl football anymore. too time consuming, too boring, too many flags and too soft. focus on other things 
what the hell is obama doing in allowing all of these potentially very sick people to continue entering the u.s. is he stupid or arrogant?

@intheelections: @realdonaldtrump my advice: run for president 
if ebola is so non contagious, how come an nbc cameraman caught it so quickly while over in west africa? u.s. is behaving very foolishly 
can you believe that president obama still hasn't stopped the flights and people pouring into the u.s. from west africa. terrible president

ebola patient duncan lied on his exit papers by saying he never came into contact with a person with ebola. he knew he did, and person died.

the ebola patient who came into our country knew exactly what he was doing. came into contact with over 100 people.here we go i told you so

they just called this the biggest scandal in u.s. sports history (gma). roger looks really weak and indecisive, must put on a better front 
what separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate. 
do you believe that obama is giving weapons to moderate rebels in syria.isn't sure who they are. what the hell is he doing.will turn on us 
why are we sending thousands of ill trained soldiers into ebola infested areas of africa bring the plague back to u.s.? obama is so stupid.

entrepreneurs: achievers move forward at all times. achievement is not a plateau, it's a beginning. 
i've realized that success requires 100% effort and 100% focus. nothing less. 
does anybody notice that atlantic city lost its magic after i left years ago. i had the big boxing, introduced ufc (ask dana),the best shows 
can you believe that the u.s. will be sending 3000 troops to africa to help with ebola.they will come home infected? we have enough problems 
it is so sad to see what has happened to atlantic city. so many bad decisions by the pols over the years airport, convention center, etc. 
i left atlantic city years ago, good timing. now i may buy back in, at much lower price, to save plaza & taj. they were run badly by funds 
if you can’t focus with unyielding resolve, then you will never be successful. believe in yourself and you can accomplish your goals.

tell saudi arabia and others that we want (demand ) free oil for the next ten years or we will not protect their private boeing 747s.pay up 
middle eastern countries must participate militarily (no running away) and big league financially in order for us to go in and save them

entrepreneurs: see yourself as victorious: look at the solution, not the problem. 
entrepreneurs: never give up. be tough. apply your skills and talent, but above all, be tenacious. 
entrepreneurs: keep the big picture in mind. there are always opportunities, and thinking too small can negate a lot of them.

so many lives and two trillion dollars wasted, and our worst enemies will get the 2nd largest oil reserves in the world. such stupid leaders 
just as i have been predicting for years, iraq will fall to the people that hate the u.s. the most just outside of baghdad. keep the oil

how much money are the lawyers for the central park five getting out of the 40 million dollars, or are they paid by the city (or both)? 
n.y. city is paying forty million dollars to five men that many think are guilty as hell. so many facts should have been trial. politics

@jeniferstevens: awful look to it.....not like trump in palm beach and briarcliff or scotland that i've played. your courses are the best 

@magnumcj: @realdonaldtrump told the truth all day about pinehurst 2. it is just not a good looking us open course. so true 
@deannaspillyard: chicago should be so lucky to have the king of new york invest in their city love the sign it should be bigger jmo 
@drake4444444: @realdonaldtrump we need trump 1) in the nfl, 2) in the oval office, and 3) on his own reality show. cute

@surayazayn: @realdonaldtrump i find yourself and your children exemplary and inspirational, sir. thank you. 
big announcement tomorrow morning concerning the great turnberry resort in scotland 

@bensext0n: @cfeetsrevenge @lukedonald @realdonaldtrump course didn't look good in hd just saying no, it looked terrible, bad for golf 
@tedataca: i concur with @realdonaldtrump on pinehurst. imo: those blasts from sandy areas looked like ieds exploding in kandahar province. 
@ichicagoscott: @realdonaldtrump it was nice of you to give @mattginellagc 15 minutes of fame that he wouldn't have had. i agree 
@welsh @realdonaldtrump you have made some great courses, but dont think that gives you the right to comment on every golf course i agree 
@mattginellagc matt, how many club championships have you won? i hear zero, or 18 fewer than me lets play for a lot? 
@ic @mattginellagc stick to media like everyone else in it with worthless opinions. donaldtrump is 10,000 times more successful than you. 
@golfermatt23: @realdonaldtrump are the @mastercard commercials filmed at trump national la? yes. 
@matthewhkurth: @realdonaldtrump played trump bedminster once...will never forget it. 
@zackalcorn: @mikehyland21 @realdonaldtrump @aec4444 big time. i love trump bedminster 
@g3stover: @mattginellagc is barking up the wrong tree getting in a twitter war with @realdonaldtrump i can beat him in golf even easier 
@mattginellagc matt, you know nothing about quality golf or what it takes to make golf successful. you are all talk, no substance 
@rink914: @ianjamespoulter actually agree...it may have been great to play but it looked atrocious on tv..i love golf..couldn't watch 
@charliemaikis: @realdonaldtrump i completely agree with dt here. pinehurst looks bad. i wouldn't pay $400 to play if it looked like that. 

@vmisciagna: @realdonaldtrump i've played the new doral which is awesome one day i hope to play another trump course 
@jeffokrina: @cbssports @eyeongolf @realdonaldtrump: i agree with the donald. what a goat track i'll take the beauty of pebble any day 
@clarksmidt: sir donald. rather than promote golf courses, please use your influence to deliver messages that will help fix our country. 
@aec4444: @realdonaldtrump i've played pinehurst and trump bedminster and donald has 2 in bedminister that are superior. thank you & true 
@mattginellagcsadly matt, you don't understand golf (even though you think you do).i have numerous couses that are far superior to pinehurst 
@mattginellagc i have watched open championships at turnberry, one of the great golf courses of the world. pinehurst not in the same league 
@mattginellagc my position on pinehurst is correct bad for the game, a dried out cow pasture. you have no clue but keep trying 
johnny miller correctly very critical of greens at pinehurst. said they should be redone 

@jackhennessy12: @realdonaldtrump look better at lahinch or trump doonbeg? true 
@aec4444: @realdonaldtrump please don't let the usga ruin your course in 2017 like they did pinehurst. i won't 
@robert_w_ga: @realdonaldtrump they think the course should be old school , you know, like before lawn care technology aka goats 
i'd bet the horrible look of pinehurst translates into poor television ratings. this is not what golf is about 
@foossh:@golfdigestmag @realdonaldtrump he has a point, fairways should be green. scruff can be as bad as you want. wouldn't pay top dollar 
@mommom: just saw the video of the bus driver saving the woman from jumping off overpass. you gave him a reward....good job donald thanks 
@epowell88: worked @ restaurant for 33 yrs & got fired because they didn't think i could keep up. no severance would u do that? no way 
@markmoreland: it's worse for @pinehurstresort. i know i wouldn't pay $400 to play what looks like a neglected municipal course. 
@timgerzabek: @realdonaldtrump @golfdigestmag i thought this was the us open not the wanna be british open 
@jshamie: @golfdigestmag couldn't agree more. the course is not punishing bad tee shots like a normal us open would. boring finish 
@golfdigestmag big news from scotland on turnberry (which, by the way, blows pinehurst away ) tomorrow morning. stay tuned. 
@golfdigestmag never in the history of televised golf has a course looked so bad and unattractive. a dry, burnt out mess bad for golf. 
.@hollysandersgc. remember, it was martin k who sank the big ten footer to win the ryder cup. he can handle the pressure

@pgongola: @realdonaldtrump @mattginellagc i think pinehurst is ugly. 

.@mattginellagc have you ever seen trump national/bedminster or trump international golf links in scotland. both far better than pinehurst 

.@mattginellagc matt, the statement about pinehurst looking like a local community golf course, awful , was not made by me but tweeted to me 
.@mattginellagc it's true matt, the new blue monster is better than pinehurst, so is bedminster. turnberry & trump aberdeen blow it away 
@tx_shaun: @realdonaldtrump happy birthday donald thanks for never being afraid to tell it like it is

@glock34girl: @realdonaldtrump please run and get america back on its feet. stay tuned 

i have been very consistent and always said that iraq would fall as soon as the u.s. left. what a terrible waste of lives and money 
iran will convince our incompetent president that they are trying to help us with iraq, take over the country & oil, and o will say thanks 
turnberry in scotland is a far superior golf course to pinehurst and it isn't even close likewise the blue monster at doral. 
iran is moving troops into iraq under the guise that it is helping out. actually, they will take over iraq and all of their oil. stupid u.s. 
@moshoodaluko: happy birthday to an american icon and a real estate el supremo... @realdonaldtrump thanks.

@inthelooptv: @realdonaldtrump your sign is absolutely stunning in chicago now only if you could wear a suit & fight crime 
@matthew_erdman: donaldtrump you built a beautiful high rise, you pay your taxes, you should be able to put up whatever signage you want. 
the iraqi army is useless. president obama, stay the hell out of iraq (we should never have been there in the first place). 
@thisisjoshsmith: i'll say it you are likely the *only* republican who could realistically beat hillary in 2016. please consider running 
@austinwalsh: @realdonaldtrump new sign looks awesome congrats 
@russell_triston: @realdonaldtrump would make a great commander in chief. true intelligence. common sense, economy knowledge, leadership. 
we should never have gone into iraq but, once in, should have gotten out a lot faster. make america great again 
@don_ekwegba: when mr. trump wants to get at something he goes all the way. he walks the talk. there are only a few of them left thank you

@tstreck: @realdonaldtrump great building. name looks awesome on it. 
@artv1028: @blairkamin @chicagotribune you don't like it because trump is a conservative. how many jobs has trump created in chicago 
@aureliusjb: @realdonaldtrump mr. trump, i love your sign, it really spiffs up that stodgy old town. keep up the great style statements. 


@laura711hender: @realdonaldtrump live in the suburbs but saw the trump sign on your beautiful building. really classy love it 

@annmajkrzak: @ap @cbschicago i like the trump logo on the building i feel this is a personal fight & will this fight cost il residents 
@nickkleutsch: @realdonaldtrump @trumpchicago personally i think the letters should be higher up. make sure everyone can see that name 
@majesticbrotha: @realdonaldtrump i'm a liberal but i feel mayor emanual has bigger fish to fry in chi town than a trump sign 
@loveandfate: @realdonaldtrump your name on your building in chicago looks awesome 
@jamesbregenzer @trumpchicago was completed during recession, when most other projects failed. trump deserves chicago's praise @blairkamin 
dopey @chicagotribune critic fails to mention the ugly sun times sign.

@ep_capital @reformedbroker @philiprucker @realdonaldtrump yo that sign gonna be more famous than hollywood i agree 
in answer to your questions about my favorite impersonator, the answer is darrell hammond. 
people are loving the trump sign on the chicago building. big league tweets, letters and calls… 
a third rate architecture critic who i thought got fired—for the failing @chicagotribune likes the building but doesn’t like the trump sign 
@awoodylou: @realdonaldtrump you are an inspiration to us all. if only you would run for president and sort all this shit out. 
@stac: following @realdonaldtrump was one of the best decisions i've made on twitter. love the way he speaks his mind and no sugar coating 
i told all of the haters and losers long ago that iraq would fall, take the oil or get out fast massive waste of lives and trillions of $'s 
iraq told us to get out, iraq is now falling, and iraq now wants us to come back don't do it unless we get the oil, and i mean all of it 

@efprestopreston: @realdonaldtrump run, donald, run 
@dbigrock34: @realdonaldtrump run for president, you got my vote 
iraq is falling apart fast two trillion dollars and so many deaths bush got us in and obama took far too long to get us out 
@mmmkamilla: i have never voted before, but if mr.trump ran for president, i would love nothing more than for my first vote to go to him.

@misscassie1230: @realdonaldtrump for president smarter than any man in the usa i agree, thanks 
iraq is far worse and of more danger to the u.s. now than it ever was under saddam hussein and this after $2 trillion and so many lives 
@pamplinfilmco: @realdonaldtrump @jenn641 can't wait 2 see the white house makeover when trump is president. our country would thrive

@askmrwhitey: @realdonaldtrump you have the finances and the name. and we have the votes... get on it. lets make it happen. 
what i am saying is that we never should have been in iraq in the first place. bush was terrible, obama is worse make america great again.

@tbrandy100:how about bush? he lied about iraq and wmd's. cost us 4000 lives i agree, i think he was also a terrible president 

no president in history has lied to the american people more than president obama in fact, it is not even close 
@geraldbjohnson: @realdonaldtrump i would vote for trump we need discipline, intelligence, and most of all strength he would bring all 3 
remember, the terrible 5 for 1 trade whereby the taliban got back leaders (killers) and we got back a nothing, will come back to haunt u.s. 
the same brilliant negotiators that gave up five taliban leaders for one traitor are now making trade deals with china & others.no chance

@summersmarcus: @realdonaldtrump always my role model thank you. 



obama is, without question, the worst ever president. i predict he will now do something really bad and totally stupid to show manhood 
“learn, know, and show. it’s a proven formula. put it to use starting today.” – think like a champion

@elchucacabra: @realdonaldtrump obama can strike a deal with the taliban, but can't make a deal with congress. 
@boycottmaypac: @realdonaldtrump he got the president to show his birth certificate he has clout my friend he can really stir things up 
i believe that in addition to the 5 terrorist leaders president obama gave up for bergdahl, a great deal of cash was also given. so stupid

@_lizzly nearly anything would be more effective than obama. @realdonaldtrump is the ideal candidate for this country's restoration thx. 
obama can release 5 senior taliban for a deserter but can’t make mexico release decorated marine sgt. andrew tahmooressi. pathetic

chris mcdaniel looks like he will win in mississippi great news and big victory for tea party 
obama never consulted with congress about a prisoner exchange. he broke the law and should be tried. our president is a total disaster 
are you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence? 
was susan rice told to lie about bergdahl? obama and his representatives lie about virtually everything, from obamacare to a deserter. 
.@newsbusters thank you for a great and very accurate story well done 
@tquoteseday: if you're interested in 'balancing' work and pleasure, stop instead make your work more pleasurable. donald trump 
rapidly failing @vanityfair magazine hits me for my strong stance against obama's brilliant 5 killers for 1 deserter trade. amazing 
@wolf_hausmann: what separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate. donald trump 
the five taliban leaders released for a deserter must really be laughing and having a good time right now. they are saying how dumb u.s. is 
our president is a great embarrassment to the u.s. how could anybody be so dumb or know so little as to make the very stupid 5 for 1 swap? 
“the entrepreneur’s ability to dream, to win, lose and win again and again is often called the entrepreneurial spirit.” – midas touch 
remember our six brave heroes who died searching for bergdahl after he deserted ://bit.ly/1kcgcsz  (h/t @military_news) 
“the problem is that no government can create real jobs. only entrepreneurs can do that.” – midas touch 
it would be nice if our commander in chief was as concerned for our veterans health as he is for illegal immigrants becoming citizens.

be sure to buy this month’s @amspec magazine. read “a trump card,” my interview with jeffrey lord. 
because of our terrible leaders, it is now open season on every american throughout the world. terrorists are thrilled. 
president said we would never leave a soldier behind. how about the 4 who died in benghazi? 
great deal, we swap 5 killer terrorists for a u.s. military deserter. that’s how the u.s. negotiates nowadays. 
@taylor_mcbath obama is actively destroying the greatest country in the world. we are going to pay a horrible price for his recent actions 
@ralphige: who knew al qaeda had such good negotiators. impressive 5 for 1 against the mighty usa @realdonaldtrump 
bowe bergdahl walked off the base after he was told not to. solders died looking for him. u.s. should never have made the deal punishment? 

that the obama administration didn't know the facts about who bergdahl was before making the stupid 5 killers for one trade is pathetic 
@mrcurvywor @realdonaldtrump enjoyed seeing you on @letterman you should run for president you would get this great country going again

@kylegolfmtnbike: @realdonaldtrump wonder how long it takes the released terrorists to attack americans? 
@rbrohammer: just watched your speech at the national press club. fantastic as usual. please consider 2016. we need fantastic leadership 
@awew: @realdonaldtrump now the enemy knows that capturing soldiers is worth it b/c our idiot president will give them what they want. 
the u.s. cannot negotiate with terrorists. it is a sad and terrible situation for the family involved, but this can only lead to disaster. 
@chazkshand: @realdonaldtrump run for president we need a leader, not a politician so true

the ring announcers are working hard to justify the mayweather victory. they should be ashamed of themselves a total joke. 
no wonder boxing is close to dead 
crowd is booing the hell out of that phony decision place is angry and going wild. fight was not even close disgusting. 
the mayweather decision is a disgrace 
no way, judges say mayweather won. investigation should take place. fix? 
fight is over mayweather lost big but lets see what judges say 
mayweather is getting absolutely killed 
floyd mayweather is being beaten up badly through 10 rounds by marcos maidana, but announcers say it is even. two rounds left. 
the reporter that called kevin durant mr. unreliable should be fired or, at least, apologize. he is a truly great player and a winner 
there must be a higher standard of accuracy in the media. incredible that some so called journalists can make up lies and get away with it

@tx_shaun: @realdonaldtrump its true, he didn't get his show until after he won the apprentice 
@alexarancio: @arseniohall doesn't mention apprentice because his ego won't let him. it's why he failed originally and will fail again 
@tarrkoziara: @realdonaldtrump @arseniohall the apprentice has started and revived a lot of people's careers. very true 
.@arseniohall how quickly people forget, but not me you told me that without the apprentice you could never have gotten your show sad 
.@arseniohall the only thing you don't mention in the nice esquire piece about you is the apprentice, without which you would be nowhere

to all haters and losers: i am not anti vaccine, but i am against shooting massive doses into tiny children. spread shots out over time.

@realmikepalumbo walked in trump tower for the first time this week.. gorgeous (as all your work). love the trump experience thank you. 
entrepreneurs: believe in yourself. if you don’t, no one else will either. realize that becoming an entrepreneur is not a group effort. 
entrepreneurs: another question to ask yourself—“what am i pretending not to see?” there may be great opportunities right around you. 
for entrepreneurs: a good question to ask yourself –“what can i provide that does not yet exist?”

@bossman140: @realdonaldtrump the most brilliant observation you have ever made. parents should take your advice 
if i were president i would push for proper vaccinations but would not allow one time massive shots that a small child cannot take autism. 
@ctsa: @realdonaldtrump when i was a kid, there were 8. now they give upwards of 31 40. it's an assault on the immune system.

@wesbart53: watched his speech yesterday...pathetic. carter esque, weak. his delivery is so cautious not to offend, absolutely zero true 
this is the time for the united states to be strengthening all important military components not rolling over and dealing from weakness 
not good or smart for obama to be calling russia a regional power or to mention the concept of a nuclear weapon going off in nyc.

obama should stop running down the stairs when getting off air force one. doesn’t look presidential and at some point he will take a fall. 
i wonder if apple is upset with me for hounding them to produce a large screen iphone. i hear they will be doing it soon—long overdue. 
obama must now focus, get his mind off march.madness , and lead watch russia closely, work hard on the economy and get rid of obamacare 
the situation with russia is much more dangerous than most people may think and could lead to world war iii. we need great leadership fast 
we should be building up our military and our missile defense systems to their highest levels ever. must be very strong to prosper & survive 
i believe putin will continue to re build the russian empire. he has zero respect for obama or the u.s. 
putin has become a big hero in russia with an all time high popularity. obama, on the other hand, has fallen to his lowest ever numbers. sad 
great advice from my mother: “trust in god and be true to yourself.” – mary macleod trump 
great advice from my father: know everything you can about what you're doing. fred c. trump 
continuous effort not strength or intelligence is the key to unlocking our potential. winston churchill 
president obama, be cool, be smart, be sharp and focus (no more march madness), and you can beat putin at his own game. it can be done 
while putin is scheming and beaming on how to take over the world, president obama is watching march madness (basketball) 
i don't hate obama at all, i just think he is an absolutely terrible president, maybe the worst in our history 
we're spending a fortune looking for the lost plane with mostly chinese passengers, and that's ok but how much are russia & china spending? 
president obama was able to fool the americans by getting elected, but not able to fool vladimir putin. too bad for us 
failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently. henry ford

tomorrow is the 10 year anniversary of the apprentice, one of the biggest hits in television history. how time flies 
why didn’t gates resign if he was so unhappy about what he was being told by obama? the fact is, iraq etc. have always been disasters 
while i am a critic of president obama, i hate it when someone (robert gates) writes a self serving negative book about his boss. 
please, @21club, go back to your original menu and preparation. believe me, it was much better. let me know when the change is made 
identify your goals. know precisely what you want to achieve, study the best people in your field,and then plan the best route for success. 
remember to think big by expanding your horizons at the same time you're expanding your net worth. 
achievers move forward at all times. don't tread water. get out there and go for it. 
stay confident even when something bad happens. it is just a bump in the road. it will pass. think big

@suegriffiths19 been a bit quiet lately? told my job is at risk ny any tips to cheer me up? be positive, do your best 
congratulations to @woodyjohnson4 and @nyjets on yesterday's very exciting game. 
cover your bases know everything you can about what you're doing. keep your focus by being well informed on a daily basis. 
ask yourself, is this a blip or is it a catastrophe? and your equilibrium will be kept in check if/when hard times hit. 
be tough, be focused. there are a lot of ups and downs, but you can ride them out if you're prepared for them. 

temperature at record lows in many parts of the country. 50 degrees below zero with wind chill in large area. global warming folks iced in 
in the upcoming new year we will focus like never before if we do that we will have complete and total victory in all we do 
we're coming up on the new year it is really important that, despite so many stupid decisions being made in washington, we make it best ever 
the global warming scientists don't want to be airlifted off the ship they are having too much fun and that is too simple a solution fame 
we should be focused on clean and beautiful air not expensive and business closing global warming a total hoax 
the rescue icebreaker, trying to free the ship of the global warming scientists, has turned back the ice is massive (a record). ironic 
@humorinstitute: i could sleep tonight if you told me we will see @therealroseanne on celebrity apprentice before i die. she would be great

happy thanksgiving everyone, enjoy your day 
i truly believe that our country has the worst and dumbest negotiators of virtually any country in the world. 
can you believe that president karzai of afghanistan is holding out for more, more, more and refuses to sign deal. tell him to go to hell 
despite the fact that i have had great success with the words you're fired, i do not like firing people. but zero on obamacare mess no way 
why doesn't president obama simply apologize for telling a big fat lie, announce that obamacare was a mistake, and deal a really great plan 
us froze $8b in iranian assets during ’79 hostage crisis. now obama is giving it back to iran while christian pastor is jailed. don't do it 
happy thanksgiving to all even the haters and losers 
tell iran to let our christian pastor go and i mean right now. if they don't, there will be hell to pay. 
make sure to enjoy your time with your family during the holiday. it is a special time. love and appreciate your family. 
the $1b failed website is the tip of the iceberg on the obamacare. over 90 million estimated will lose their plans next year.

mr. president, tell iran to immediately free the christian pastor, as a sign of good faith, & if they refuse break off talks big sanctions 
president obama said, over and over again, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, period this turned out to be a total lie 90 mill. 
look at the solution, not the problem. learn to focus on what will give results. 
set the example. you can motivate others as well as yourself by remembering that you are setting the example.

president obama is finally getting hammered, even by his most loyal supporters and the press i guess they can only take so much 
new poll, wow 53% say president obama is not honest & trustworthy. what took them so long. go back and look at his house purchase in chicago 
don't worry, the united states will be great again 
just got home, watching the news, and every story is bad about the u.s. someday we will return to being great again, but we need leadership 
“the worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it.” – the art of the deal. 
why didn't obama, as part of the negotiation, free the christian pastor saeed abedini? ://bit.ly/18jfbar  
obama is going to take away over 90m americans’ healthcare plans but he is letting iran keep its nukes. just think about that. 
who would you rather have negotiating with iran president obama or toronto mayor ford? my money is on ford. 
realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort. you're in charge. everything starts with you. 
don't underestimate yourself or your possibilities keep your focus intact, and focus on the positives. 
after settling for a ridicilous 13 billion dollars, j.p.morgan's lawyer is critical of the amount of the fine why did they settle then dumb 
best book ever on dealmaking (or so they say) trump: the art of the deal. go get it, and others, washington you really can do better 
i know it has been many years since our country made great deals, but isn't it about time we start, right now. make america great again 
the reason great dealmakers do not openly celebrate a deal, especially one that is not complete, is that it shows weakness to the other side 
john kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with iran. great dealmakers do not celebrate deals,they just go on to the next one 
tom brady is a good friend of mine, a great player, a great guy and a total winner fantastic comeback win this is what our country needs 
tom brady has done a great job tonight amazing new england comeback. good game not over yet 
we had all the leverage in our nuclear negotiations with iran and our leaders foolishly decided to let them out of the trap. why? 
how much longer are we expected to put up with the world's most incompetent leader obamacare, iran, syria, bads deals. just never ends 
i will be on fox & friends tomorrow morning at 7. will be discussing basic stupidity and incompetence, of which our leaders have plenty 

i do not understand how so many of my jewish friends backed obama in the last election. he is a total disaster for israel and always will be 
how far has the united states gone down when we are reduced to accept the imbecilic deal just agreed to with iran. read the art of the deal 
what a rotten deal we made with iran. we get nothing (except laughter at our stupidity). they get everything, including delay and big cash 
they changed the name global warming to climate change because the concept of global warming just wasn't working 
the people that gave you global warming are the same people that gave you obamacare 
@mikehaas33: @realdonaldtrump mar a lago a spectacular property. here with wells fargo tonight and hoping you will come say hello i did 
snow and ice, freezing weather, in texas, arizona and oklahoma what the hell is going on with global warming? 
get smart on knockout assaults and crime we have to be slightly more vicious (and violent) than the assaulter and crime would end fast 
the scum that gets high on badly hurting old ladies and others through knockout assaults wouldn't feel that way with a gun at their head 
we are using the absolute wrong negotiating technique with respect to the iran nuclear talks. strengthen sanctions until great deal is made 
@whiteshaunwhite i dedicate my 750 tweet to most inspiring entrepreneurs of our time @realdonaldtrump, @billgates thx.

if you are lucky enough to catch a knockout assaulter before getting slugged, and you carry a gun, shoot the bastard (teach them a lesson)

the wimps that run penn state should be forced to resign (and be sued) for the pathetic settlement they made and destruction of great legacy 

i wonder if the rutgers coach who had the audacity to yell at the player is a proponent of global warming?

more dead people voted in the last election than enrolled in obamacare. congratulations america 
@mikedemkiw true 
breaking news negotiations with iranians broke down because obama insisted that they use obamacare. 
@dany8ro: aha rt @realdonaldtrump: you have good taste @jayrobby: i love bill gates and warren buffet and donald trump. i so love them. 
president obama is the best thing that ever happened to jimmy carter 
@kbaileyjava2: @realdonaldtrump celebrity apprentice please asap 
@andrewsnicoll: @realdonaldtrump the same idiots who think he was born in the usa dopes 
@ojosborn: @realdonaldtrump i am one of them fools. the presidents heart in right place wrong, he knowingly lied bad intentions 

in a new poll a majority of people felt the president knowingly lied about health care pledge. who are the fools who don't think he lied? 
@countrygurl4747: @realdonaldtrump please run in 2016 we need a smart man like you to turn this once great nation back true 
@bretbaier you are doing really great keep it up (of which i have no doubt). 

the same people that built the obamacare website used, as the face of the website, someone who is not a us citizen. incompetent. 
can you believe it—the model who mysteriously disappeared from the obamacare website is not a us citizen—she’s from colombia. 
no matter how far down a path you go, if it's the wrong path, turn around and go back home before it is too late. 
obamacare is on life support it will soon be dead on arrival a bad concept that was imcompetently administered 
president obama is under pressure from democrats to undo his lie on obamacare. his problem is that such a move would end obamacare. 

@shrubshrub: i've said it before. i'll say it again. the turn down service at the @trumptoronto is the best in the world. thank you 
obamacare is one of the worst political disasters of all time 4,992,343 americans losing coverage, less than 50,ooo new signups. 
everyone should watch the documentary ‘windfall’ on @netflix. see an upstate ny town ruined by environmentalists & windfarms.

while i was in moscow i see that president obsma apologized for his lie, i mean statement, on obamacare how nice of him to be so forthright

@el_juino: @realdonaldtrump well i will predict that if u run for president you will win 
@joeyb134: i hope @realdonaldtrump will invite me to golf with him @trumpdoral when it is all complete. it looks like an awesome place 
if justice roberts had done the right thing and voted against obamacare, our country would be in a lot better shape right now total turmoil 
drew brees is having a great game a fantastic quarterback and really good guy 
if we could force russia, china and other competitors to use obamacare, we would be able to instantly destroy their great economic success 
@brahsumatra: @realdonaldtrump remember when you use to have real hair? (spelling) i still do dummy, it is all mine 
remember that i predicted a long time ago that president obama will attack iran because of his inability to negotiate properly not skilled

i will be going to asheville, north carolina, tonight for the 95th birthday party of the great billy graham such a wonderful man 
if democrats do not start opposing obamacare, and fast, republicans will have a massive victory in 2014 far greater than any predictions 
a level will be reached where obamacare will be so out of control, expensive and unwieldy that the biggest supporters will abandon ship. 
prediction: the disaster known as obamacare will only get worse and republicans will gain far greater power than they have had in years 
put kathleen sebelius out of her misery and lovingly say, you're fired let her go home to her family and rest. bring in top flight people 
she is so sad and pathetic that i almost feel sorry for sec.sebelius. she has done great harm to many people and must be fired. incompetent 
just sit back and watch, obamacare is such a disaster it will fall like a house of broken cards. the website is the best part of this mess 
when obama tried to tweak his previous statement on obamacare he made it an even greater lie even the senate democrats are angry with him

lies and incompetence the two words that are most closely associated with obamacare 
@rizz_lizz: @realdonaldtrump @andersengell mr.president, djt, could do this in his sleep light years ahead of opponents.

@msmegzilla: @realdonaldtrump i wish you were president but only if you want our country to be great again 
@seancourt: i feel safer knowing men like @realdonaldtrump are around thank you.

good advice from my mother, mary macleod trump: “trust in god and be true to yourself.” 
good advice from my father, fred c. trump: know everything you can about what you're doing. 
you've got something unique to offer. find out what it is. ask yourself: what can i provide that does not yet exist?

@rydev22 great 
@strommer07 yes and thanks. 
@danamira apology accepted. 
if the saudis are so concerned about syria then they should go in themselves. stop telling us to do their dirty work. 
i’ll soon be leaving for washington where @amspec will give me the t. boone pickens entrepreneur award. very exciting 
where’s the accountability for the $635m website fiasco in the obama administration? heads should roll and officials should be fired 
on fifth avenue, the iconic @trumptowerny is one of nyc's most heavily visited tourist attractions ://bit.ly/1idiogo  
why doesn't president obama call upon the nsa to fix the badly broken website then they could spy on all of the many cheaters & arrest them 
honestly, whether you're for or against obamacare, the 635 million dollar website fiasco is bad for the u.s. it makes us look totally inept 
@donjuanriley1: getting a picture of donald trump and putting it on a shirt tomorrow cause hes a true american hero :) wow, so nice 
breaking news the washington redskins have just announced that they will be removing the name washington from their name

the rollout of obamacare is a total disaster and an embarrassment to our country. the world is watching and laughing.$635,000,000 website 
@nymag in every interview new york magazine has done for years they ask the same question what do you think of donald trump? beggars 
@nymag can you imagine a top editor at new york magazine calling for my death if they were responsible, he would be fired totally biased. 
@nymag wow, numbers are really looking bad at new york magazine. while very boring, it is also very biased. too bad, was once great

@tonyturko: @realdonaldtrump nbc report: white house taking obamacare website offline again for “repairs. 
@tormeypaul: @realdonaldtrump @danamira @nymag does anyone actually still subscribe? not many 
just like its website, obamacare is a disaster.maybe all those who are fighting it are wasting their time it will fail on its own 
secy. sebelius, who was responsible for the horrendous obamacare rollout, should resign or be fired.refuses to go before congress to explain 
@michaelledeitri: and this is why r kids are bullies, horrible examples set by adults. no excuses @nymag fire him @foxnews @cbsnews

@afrodeziak: @danamira @realdonaldtrump @nymag unlike the rest of you libs, mr. trump will be just fine. he doesn't have obamacare 

@phickeyma: when i come home from work my twitter page is filled with donald trump tweets...love reading them...so bold & truthful.

@afrodeziak: @danamira @realdonaldtrump @nymag mr. amira, are you man enough to apologize ?? he is not man enough 
@rockinthetote: @realdonaldtrump @danamira @nymag what a horrible thing to say not exactly an unbiased editor very unprofessional & sad 
@afrodeziak: @danamira @realdonaldtrump @nymag no place for that in a civil society. you should resign immediately. they should demand it 
@josethegr8t: @realdonaldtrump @val_wonders @danamira @nymag if it does go up for sale ill buy them out. don't do it bad investment

@matthewhawilo: @realdonaldtrump @danamira @melaniatrump i will never subscribe. just for you & your beautiful family, donald. it's boring 
@cwide12: @realdonaldtrump @danamira @nymag never had the stinking nymag but if i did i would cancel for the trump it's dead anyway 
@val_wonders: @realdonaldtrump @danamira @nymag does anyone read @nymag anymore. i'm sure it'll be sold for a dollar just like newsweek. 
@silvermarie2001: @realdonaldtrump whats wrong with canadians? nothing except they are too smart for u.s. leaders to deal with 
i hope everyone that read @danamira's reprehensible statement will cancel their subscription to @nymag in protest. let me know. 

no wonder @nymag is doing so poorly, with an idiot sr. editor like @danamira, it will only get worse 
@danamira @nymag a terrible statement like that shows how desperate you and your magazine are. you should be ashamed. 
canadians kicked out the firm that the u.s. paid all that money to for the failed website. how stupid are our leaders ? this is a scandal 
wow, china's growth accelerated 7.8% in third quarter. if the u.s. had half that number we would be the talk of the world need leadership 
no surprise saudis turned down spot on un security council. they don’t want responsibility. just have us do their heavy lifting. 
i love watching the dishonest writers @nymag suffer the magazine’s failure. 
@nymag’s sales are so dismal that w/ its record 2013 losses it is going bi weekly ://bit.ly/1hxdkbj  should end pain & just fold. 
our country is being run by total amateurs. let’s just call it “amateur hour.” 
can you imagine a canadian company developing our website? terrible way to put americans back to work.

if the u.s. government doesn't give the money necessary for the burials of our military personnel, i will.the u.s. under obama's leadership

president obama wants to change the name of the white house because it is highly discriminating and not at all politically correct 
president should not be telling the washington redskins to change their name our country has far bigger problems focus on them,not nonsense 

@mimi_la_reina: @fogslifting @realdonaldtrump @redskins that will never fly they'd have to do the same for the chiefs, braves, indians ect

as a stockholder in apple, they should get on with a larger screen iphone as a supplement—immediately. 
my comments on a larger screen iphone were in addition to existing unit, not a replacement. screen should be 10% larger than samsung. 
@geomac24 amazing engineering accomplishment that does not make economic sense. 
@anthonydefrenza: @realdonaldtrump apple is hard of hearing. so true 

lightweight schneiderman's suit was filed on a saturday (unheard of) against a school with a 98% approval rating right after obama meeting. 
lightweight a.g. eric schneiderman meets with president obama (who he told me sucks as a president), and quickly files a suit against me 
@iphoneteam better get a large screen iphone, and fast, or risk losing even more business. samsung cannot believe you have not acted dumb 
@keilanik1: @realdonaldtrump apple meant for their phones to go to people who have super sight & abnormally tiny fingers for texting 
i cannot believe that apple didn't come out with a larger screen iphone. samsung is stealing their business. steve jobs is spinning in grave

@accountsrs @realdonaldtrump thank you for saving new york from another spitzer era. we got lucky 
obama must now start focusing on our country, jobs, healthcare and all of our many problems. forget syria and make america great again 
putin is having such a good time. our president is making him look like the genius of all geniuses. do not fear,we are a nation of potential 
i said that eliot spitzer was going to lose when he was way up in the polls. i fought him when others retreated out of fear. never give up 
spitzer and weiner lost, lightweight eric schneiderman will be next he will be challenged in the primary. he has done a really poor job 
@redellis1: @realdonaldtrump he must go... people like him r destroying our country and our principals re lightweight a.g. schneiderman

weiner is gone, spitzer is gone next will be lightweight a.g. eric schneiderman. is he a crook? wait and see, worse than spitzer or weiner 
assad hit the jackpot 
back to work for the president to try and keep some dignity for the office and himself. the so called rebels must be thoroughly confused 
the only reason obama gave a speech last night was because it was on the schedule putin is laughing and the reviews have been really bad

thank you to all of my twitter followers for helping to defeat weiner and spitzer. remember, in the beginning they said it couldn't be done 
i fought hard against spitzer and weiner, and both lost. for a while, when spitzer was way up, it seemed that i was a lone voice good power

@mikethescrew: @realdonaldtrump give credit where it is due. nyc voters chose correctly. 
wow, eliot spitzer has lost great news for new york city 
bottom line, i don't think president changed people's minds must hope for a lifeline from putin, a very dangerous lifeline at that 
we will have to see what russia's next move will be. they may have given him an out of an embarrassing situation or drove into deeper mess 
he is working hard and for that he must be given credit 

doesn't want to remove assad worries what comes next. 
making his case in a nice and articulate manner. 
does he look sharp, smart and presidential his hands keep hitting the podium, making a loud and distracting noise microphone too sensitive.

@midgespeaks i want him to do a great job but he can't. 
@anitaozz2: @toure @realdonaldtrump trump will do or say anything. but toure (why only one name?) is just a very dumb racist bad ratings 
president obama, do not attack syria. there is no upside and tremendous downside. save your powder for another (and more important) day 
isn't it intetesting that anybody who attacks president obama is considered a racist by the real racists out there 
@unabashedprog: @realdonaldtrump @thegroveguru can you imagine serious people comparing modern warfare to a football game? actually yes 
@rlsteetle: @realdonaldtrump i'm addicted to your books. are you writing another any time soon? at some point, there is so much to write 

speaking of our very stupid war with iraq, it is totally disintegrating and iran (with russia) will walk in and take it over (lots of oil) 
@lucindamac thank you, but we are dealing with many very stupid people 
@thegroveguru: @realdonaldtrump could you imagine bill belichek broadcasting to tom coughlin exactly when and where he was going to blitz? 
@ericjgiroux: @realdonaldtrump you need to make a run time will tell 
@robertr369: @realdonaldtrump if only japan had the same courtesy dec 1941 they should have told us they were coming like us with syria 
i'm a republican but not a fan of the last george bush he also was a lousy president (iraq etc.). in fact, he was so bad he gave us obama 
former president jimmy carter is so happy that he is no longer considered the worst president in the history of the united states 
syria has been given so much time that much of the things we were going to bomb have been moved into civilian areas a polititian's war. 
just watching nbc news where our potential attack is being detailed the exact ships, the stealth bombers, the destinations so ridiculous 
@bretbaier: thx rt @jedediahbila well done, @bretbaier thurs cable news ratings: fox's bret baier beats cnn, msnbc, hln combined. 
@curehdsaorg: @bretbaier huntingtons disease is a terminal and genetic illness.please retweet ://www.hdsa.org  for education. 
if syria was forced to use obamacare they would self destruct without a shot being fired. obama should sell them that idea 
when we have big disasters, no one comes to our aid or even suggests helping but we are always expected to come to the aid of others 
@garrygreiner: @realdonaldtrump we should send obama and congress to syria 
“any political leader who won’t face the future head on is putting the american dream at risk.” – the america we deserve

many of the syrian rebels are radical jihadi islamists who are murdering christians. why would we ever fight with them?

“remember the golden rule of negotiating: ‘he who has the gold makes the rules.’” – midas touch 
@robyncook7: it's sad that @realdonaldtrump knows more about politics than our politicians 
i am not angry at russia (or china) because their leaders are far smarter than ours. we need real leadership, and fast,before it is too late 
i wonder how much our leaders have promised, or given, russia in order for them to behave and not make the u.s. look even worse? 
really bad news just announced concerning jobs. far fewer jobs created in august than anticipated. interest rates, therefore, to remain low. 
we don't have the leadership, including the generals (who just said the element of surprise does not matter) to attack anyone cool it. 
did you ever see a situation so ridiculous as our president explaining what, when and where to congress about a syrian attack. far too late 
@vindictivraider: @realdonaldtrump well quit yapping about and run for office. i like your ideas. do it 
@reallltalk: @realdonaldtrump trump for president thanks. 
@autumnallday: @realdonaldtrump i wish you'd run for office. the country needs more minds like yours. thank you. 
@khalidnasser: @realdonaldtrump in this case, what would you do if you were the president? i'd rebuild the u.s. and make it great again 
@jahbalon: why is sierra club not speaking up for the birds slain by turbines? must read from biologist ://www.masterresource.org/2013/09/hiding avian mortality altamont pass/#sthash.rgukzmpv.dpuf … 
the terrorists in syria are calling themselves rebels and getting away with it because our leaders are so completely stupid 
@jessegunplayjay: @realdonaldtrump you're a pussy shut up and stop crying @jayleno show is funny no, jay is dumb as a rock gets outplayed 
we should not attack syria but if they make the stupid move to do so, the arab league,whose members are laughing at us, should pay

if president obama was going to attack syria, he should’ve done it a long time ago as a surprise & not after (cont) ://tl.gd/n_1rm9ngg  
that would mean that eliot spitzer has failed at everything he's done politics, tv & even real (cont) ://tl.gd/n_1rm9nda  
it will be interesting to see what happens to eliot spitzer if he loses the election for comptroller to very capable @scottmstringer. 
i have just lost my beautiful & elegant long time exec. assistant norma foerderer. she passed away yesterday – a truly magnificent woman. 
again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack syria if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the u.s. gets nothing 
@gregfrech: @realdonaldtrump have you seen the video of the rebel commander cutting out and eating the syrian soldiers heart & liver 
while everyone is waiting and prepared for us to attack syria, maybe we should knock the hell out of iran and their nuclear capabilities? 
if you look at the horrible picture on the front page of the ny times of the rebels executing prisoners, you would say forget the rebels 
tell congress to straighten out the many problems of our country before trying to be the policemen to the world. make america great again 
@whoopsydoodle: @realdonaldtrump god your the best mr. trump i like you tooooo 
@bchipper83: @realdonaldtrump haha i love how you just tell like it is you aren't who you are by not doing just that thank you 
the only reason president obama wants to attack syria is to save face over his very dumb red line statement. do not attack syria,fix u.s.a. 
president obama put himself in a very bad position when he talked about syria crossing the red line. amazingly, now he denies he said that 
@bchipper83: @realdonaldtrump haha i love how you just tell like it is you aren't who you are by not doing just that 
@walterdisneyusa: @realdonaldtrump you would make such a good president thank you

@sebast_valmont: @realdonaldtrump when is @macmiller gonna pay you? that is a very good question his only good song is donald trump. 
@thecarlossegura: @realdonaldtrump do u like lettermans show? yes, much smarter than leno. 
@fsusteve: @realdonaldtrump why do you think you're so polarizing? because i like to be it often times brings out the truth 
is anthony weiner a jerk or what 
jay leno and his people are constantly calling me to go on his show. my answer is always no because his show sucks. they love my ratings 
@pdgreenwood: i wish i could go on jay's show so badly real quote from @realdonaldtrump real quote is i wish they would stop calling 
@twojacksdetail send it to me in new york, doug thanks. 
@reaperoftruth: @realdonaldtrump u mad because @jayleno doesn't want u on his show? he begs me to go on his show done it many times loser 
@whiskeyscowgirl: @realdonaldtrump just turned off jay i can't watch him anymore, running out with the phony high fives he's lost it 
@jp_worldwide: @realdonaldtrump you need to go on @howardstern to bash jay leno. howard hates him too howard is right on leno jay is over 
@mariadavidson10: @realdonaldtrump you have more followers than they (@billmaher @jayleno) do. so true, and am hopefully much smarter 
“appreciate your property, and your property will appreciate for you.” – think like a billionaire 
i hear this moron @billmaher said nasty things about me (hair etc—boring) on the terminated @jayleno show. stupid guy/bad ratings

.@serenawilliams had a flawless @usopen quarterfinal win last night. she’s a great player and a wonderful person.

@ukn96: @realdonaldtrump if two of your competitors were at war, would you let them destroy each other? or would you back one? 
@andrewessex1: @realdonaldtrump @tannermarkboots just finished 'art of the deal', brilliant insight into your mind, thanks 
@atkins4: @realdonaldtrump you realize that is what iran wants, dont you? you beat iran in a much different fashion not through syria 
for all of those fools that want to attack syria, the u.s.has lost the vital element of surprise so stupid could be a disaster 
what i am saying is stay out of syria. 
the great generals macarthur and patton, real leaders and fighters, are spinning in their graves as we give syria info & time to prepare. 
@bigsexybdavis: @realdonaldtrump mr trump would attack syria or no? no, lets make our country great again as they fight their war 
@battoulshamsi: @realdonaldtrump i just love ur way of thinking and analyzing things, 2 the point. thanks. 
@davidagoodman: @realdonaldtrump:how can general dempsey tell obama delaying syria bombardment will have no consequences? he's no patton 
@nattiebright: @realdonaldtrump if u r so disappointed at obama why don't u run for president in 2016 watch

@thobane63: @realdonaldtrump why the hell are you always criticising obama because he is doing a terrible, in fact embarrassing, job 
president obama's arab spring is not looking so good right now 
@trill_blowa: if the government just listened to @realdonaldtrump this country would be so much better 
@devante4liberty: @realdonaldtrump but if we had a republican president you would say the exact opposite right? wrong 
think of it, the arab league doesn't want to get involved with syria but they want us to do their dirty work. how stupid 
if the u.s. attacks syria and hits the wrong targets, killing civilians, there will be worldwide hell to pay. stay away and fix broken u.s. 
our country is looking very bad right now 
@desorourke84: @realdonaldtrump trump tower here in chicago is such an impressive building and architecturally really fits in with the area 
@alto67: @realdonaldtrump your thoughts on bill de blasio for mayor... i predicted two years ago that he would win 
@flljeff: @realdonaldtrump you always keep it real mr. trump...the truth hurts sometimes and america needs you to run in 2016 
@tarekr: @realdonaldtrump if you ever become president of the us, what would be your first step? get rid of obamacare 
@rizz_lizz: @realdonaldtrump i am surprised weiner is so delusional to think that he still has a shot should seek help. 
@pantysoaker420: @realdonaldtrump @schulesix3 @jamesfrancotv james franco is prettier than donald trump but i get better ratings 
@charliemassie: i hope @realdonaldtrump runs for president. for obvious reasons.

@ewudziyamoah: @realdonaldtrump glad to find you thank you for your philanthropic work, thank you 
eliot spitzer has failed at everything he has ever done, and now he wants to be comptroller. thrown out of politics and off of tv, crazy 
each time i see one of anthony weiner's television ads for mayor i ask, what the hell is he doing just wasting money & time go get a job 

@53andlex: @realdonaldtrump, please run for potus 2016. america desperately needs a true leader with common sense thank you. 
@schulesix3: roast of @jamesfrancotv will be the best one since @realdonaldtrump ok, as long as mine remains number one 
@mikethoms85: @realdonaldtrump with all due respect, bush did exactly the same thing in iraq. you will seldom see me defending bush. 

@tkeller316 thanks 
in war, the elememt of surprise is sooooo important.what the hell is obama doing. 
@libertybellskp: @realdonaldtrump that's the plan. have you ever seen such a clueless leader in all your life? i am stunned daily. 
@bdeal10: @realdonaldtrump you should be our next president. this country would be in much better shape if you would have run in 2012 true 
@swagdaddyyol0: why isn't @realdonaldtrump president instead of obama ?? that is truly a good question 
we have given syria so much time and information there has never been such an instance in wartime history. syria is now fully prepared 
why isn't the arab league paying for everything and sending troops? they want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves 
the arab league stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on syria, but they want us to attack.are our leaders insane or just stupid 

@mguarino64: @realdonaldtrump how would you treat the syria situation if president ? i'd let them all fight with each other focus on us 
@imanthonyholmes: i've always looked up to @realdonaldtrump. business and politics he's the man thank you 
@rick_huebner: @realdonaldtrump my son joey survived leukemia. he is is now 13. thank you make a wish and nccf for everything they did. 
it is truly amateur hour at the white house and this is why we should not be doing the war thing right now 
@akmackey so true 
@illuminati6sep: @realdonaldtrump , you should be president . save america thank you 
president obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly (in more ways than money) attack on syria 
@brandiharmon good luck. 
@timi_fel: @realdonaldtrump you always have something negative to say about obama ,dont you? yes 
@bbpack you have real talent

@irazaalishah: @realdonaldtrump donald you are anti obama no matter what obama does, you will take the opposite view. wrong all on merit 
@dickquinn: @realdonaldtrump obviously amateur hour at the wh. obama was unqualified when he ran and remains so. 
@danconiapm: @realdonaldtrump he's no churchill. he might not even be jimmy carter 
@politixchick: just from reading his tweets, it seems like @realdonaldtrump could run our country much better than our president right now. 
did anyone notice that obama failed to get a coalition of other countries to go along with us. he couldn't even get britain no leadership. 
@aveyahdoeswatch thank you. 
@jayneg53: @realdonaldtrump can't say obama doesn't know how to throw a polite war general patton would not be happy right now 
@jessenicholas13: @realdonaldtrump i'm scared for my future. you should be 
be prepared, there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into world war iii. 
china is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess. they will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortune & laugh at us 
obama now just wants to save face, russia is now telling him don't do it . he waited too long and the other side is much better prepared. 
who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes. call it the plenty of notice war 

syria has prepared for an attack based on all of our talk they have moved targeted ammunition and supplies to new locations.amazing 
for the first time in the history of military operations a country has broadcast what, when and where they will be doing in a future attack 
the president must get congressional approval before attacking syria big mistake if he does not 

@joe1spro: @realdonaldtrump the president of syria is killing people inhumanly but the so called rebels may be just as bad (or worse) 
@kingsfansouth: @realdonaldtrump i usually agree with you, not tonight. stop criticizing the president. i will when he makes good decisions 
@jenconservative: @rkdrake @realdonaldtrump i would be totally surprised if the us even has any money to spend on syria we don't 
@jaymiller283: @realdonaldtrump @jenconservative we need a strong minded potus in office before we enter into another war. 
@kswizzle43: @realdonaldtrump what would you do give a solution vs being so critical?. . i would make america great again 
@leebandoni: @realdonaldtrump for once the uk has seen sense and not been dragged into this. they were, for once, very smart 
@onemikex: @realdonaldtrump he's to soft of a president incompetent would be a better word 
@jenconservative: @realdonaldtrump not to mention we probably don't have the money to spend on another long war so true 
how bad has our leader made us look on syria. stay out of syria, we don't have the leadership to win wars or even strategize. 
if obama attacks syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed, he and the u.s. will look very bad 
is everyone seeing how incompetently our country is being run by watching the mess with syria? our leaders don't know what they are doing 
the ratings of the cycle on msnbc, a sad and pathetic show, are way down. if they fired racist moron @toure, a truly stupid guy, they live

@reuschal: @realdonaldtrump how do you know those kids will never work? i know 
so, a woman in chicago, who never had a job, has 9 kids with 7 different men (she is one of many). these kids will never work. trouble 
@hrt05hsv: @realdonaldtrump @realdbp you could do it in your sleep and still make more sense than these other morons. thanks. 
@ronhromadka: @realdonaldtrump talk shows are stale but a daily look at the inside wheeling and dealing of the trump org. exciting 
@joseczrs: of course @realdonaldtrump would be one of the few to publicly support miley cyrus' racist behavior. oh, & now she's a racist? 
@wcmartzofficial so true 
@realdbp: @realdonaldtrump a talk show is a great idea. please make the time sir. the country needs you now more than ever. 
@realdbp: @realdonaldtrump a talk show would be the perfect arena for you mr. trump. ratings would soar through the roof but no time

what will we get for bombing syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict? obama needs congressional approval.

let the arab league take care of syria. why are these rich arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack? 
if we are going to continue to be stupid and go into syria (watch russia), as they say in the movies, shoot first and talk later 
i wonder what the great generals like patton, the big m, or robert e. lee would have thought about our stupid broadcasting of an attack? 
@walaa_3ssaf no, dopey, i would not go into syria, but if i did it would be by surprise and not blurted all over the media like fools. 
@janusdcjavu: @realdonaldtrump the one who talks much, does nothing except make 10 billion dollars go get a job dumbass 
@voicelikeariot_: @realdonaldtrump @washingtonpost: why obama is giving up the element of surprise in syria perhaps because he is stupid? 
@ronniedunn1164: @realdonaldtrump @hunterboss1996 a few billion more dollars, but i'd rather say president trump than president gates 
that said, the rich arab countries should get involved with the syrian mess, not us.we should start rebuilding our own country & military. 
why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack syria. why can't we just be quiet and, if we attack at all, catch them by surprise? 
i give the president's speech a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10 not bad but room for improvement 
why would anyone think obama would attack syria the day of his speech in washington. he doesn't want to detract from his press & glory.

what did our very stupid & ineffective a.g. eric schneidean, during his trips to my office, tell me about president obama & governor cuomo? 
after years of long stops then starts, why did dopey eric scheiderman tell people in the trump org. this case is going away,we have no case 
how can an attorney general ask for campaign contributions during his evaluation of a case a total sleazebag 
why did lightweight a.g. eric schneiderman come to my office on numerous occasions begging for campaign contributions? also, recent asks? 
why is it that eric schneiderman is considered a lightweight by so many and has failed to go after jon corzine and big abusers for billions? 
why did failing a.g. eric schneiderman, after years of looking, file his pathetic lawsuit on a saturday afternoon (unheard of)? no case

let me sum this up for you... ://fb.me/1ekri3vdr  
@mikeloyacenter that's great 
less than ten days until i keynote @bobvanderplaats’ @thefamilyleader leadership summit. tix going fast. ://bit.ly/14qe7b9  
@trumpwinery's sparkling, white & red wine collections have won numerous major awards & acclaim including ://bit.ly/16oqas3  
keystone xl should be approved but more importantly we should be drilling & fracking our own resources. would be an economic windfall. 
do as i say, not as i do. obama just granted a special obamacare exemption for all congress ://politi.co/18vbthp  all are hypocrites 
over 35 cia operatives were on the ground in benghazi the night of the 9.11 attack ://bit.ly/14mco2u  still a phony scandal ? 
if once you forfeit the confidence of your fellow citizens, you can never regain their respect and their esteem. abraham lincoln 
for all of those who have been asking about online sales, the donald j. trump signature collection ties & shirts are sold @macys.com

@jpickering1 @realdonaldtrump how long until a trump golf course hosts a major? very soon 
go confidently in the direction of your dreams. live the life you have imagined. henry david thoreau 
@not_that_actor i know 

@lcamp34 thanks. 
@eboy12318 thanks 
@hattakzots: @realdonaldtrump you're one of the only voices of reason in this crumbling nation america needs a clean up 
isn't it sad the way putin is toying with obama regarding snowden. we look weak and pathetic. could not happen with.a strong leader 
@robocosby: help me @realdonaldtrump i am depressed . keep your chin up 
@bobbassman: @realdonaldtrump @anthonyolgin like when bush killed all those kids in iraq when he invaded the wrong country? really bad war 

@ctormes: @realdonaldtrump @anthonyolgin do you think there's any chance of changing the course we're on? yes, but we must move quickly 
@patrick_gibson: @realdonaldtrump country shouldn't be capitalized there donald. i always cap when talking about the usa (only) 
@anthonyolgin: .@realdonaldtrump do u ever get sad? yes, when i look at what's happening to our country . 
@mhrynuik: @ashleymchandler so cool that @realdonaldtrump and @joelosteen are twitter friends and real friends, joel is the best

i’m on @etonlinealert tonight to talk about what the yankees should have done about a rod long ago ://et.tv/13ymngl  
@nick_botha thank you. 
@compaqsstring3 perhaps. 
eliot better have a great pre nup—i want to help silda in her negotiation. 
people don’t know that eliot’s father is very rich. eliot likes to pretend he’s poor to appeal to voters. 
wow does eliot spitzer have a girlfriend? this is getting exciting. 
if you don't do your part, don't blame god. billy sunday 

it is a great victory for nyc that a rod will never wear pinstripes again. 
i am getting worried about chris @hardball_chris matthews. is he drinking again? 
chris @hardball_chris matthews ratings are at new historic lows. he is single handedly destroying the entire @msnbc channel. 
snowden is handing over to russia a treasure trove of intel. our politicians are incapable of dealing 
a sad day for america with snowden being granted asylum in russia. putin is laughing at obama. 
be sure to keep following announcements on the development of trump international golf club dubai. will be spectacular. 
my @stevedeaceshow int. on china, the economy and my upcoming keynote at @thefamilyleader leadership summit ://bit.ly/16mcxri  
@willeshirey @realdonaldtrump so proud to be going to your alma mater you smart man great. 
@kaplunm @realdonaldtrump thoughts on snowden being granted asylum in russia? no respect for u.s. by russia. 
@thetylerdeboer @joelosteen being associated with joel is my great honor he is a fantastic man 
i wonder who @arseniohall's first guest will be his show will be great 


@crimmsnchin happy birthday andrew

all i can say is that if i were president, snowden would have already been returned to the u.s. (by their fastest jet) and with an apology 
snowden is doing great damage to our relations with other countries and u.s.prestige. china is laughing at us as he continues illegal action 
snowden is sitting in china and taunting the u.s. he is mocking us as a country. great time to place a tax on china trade if not turned over

@dblsolo700 not concerned about them weren't they brutally mugging people in the park? go check your facts. 

likewise, the primary victims of violent crimes are in the african american and hispanic communities. these people want law and order now 
when it comes to violent crime, and if we are going to solve the problem, we must stop being so politically correct must tell it like it is 
sadly, the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics a tough subject must be discussed. 
according to bill o'reilly, 80% of all the shootings in new york city are blacks if you add hispanics, that figure goes to 98%. 1% white.

why didn't president obama just go inside when it started raining yesterday common sense the two marines looked very uncomfortable & wet. 

the live finale of @apprenticenbc is this sunday at 9/8c. watch and see who will be the first ever all star celebrity apprentice. 
enviro friendly? ap impact: obama administration allows wind farms to kill eagles, birds despite federal laws ://bit.ly/10viboi  
this sunday’s live finale of @apprenticenbc will be tough & nasty. be sure to watch @pennjillette & @traceadkins fight to the finish 

the sexual abuse that is so rampant has, according to generals, greatly weakened our military. they have failed to stop it. 
just in—all efforts to stop sexual abuse in the military have totally failed—in fact, the stoppers have become the abusers. 
.@nymag is a piece of garbage but i think it is very nice & charitable that they employ the no talent illiterate hack @jonathanchait. 

@ccv77 thanks, very nice. 
@funnsylvania: when is @realdonaldtrump going to finally get his own talk show? he would absolutely destroy the competition thanks time 
celebrity apprentice will be live on sunday at 9 pm (from new york city).casting has already begun for next season. 
@dstrick44: @realdonaldtrump @ricksmi54256322 you did run. and you had your ass handed you. never ran stupid, but i wish i had would have w 
in other words, our military has a very big problem 
unfortunately with some men when the poison kicks in (not me of course) there are no rules or guidelines in the military that will stop them 
i was never a fan of bush 2 for many reasons, including the fact that we should never have gone into iraq but once there, kept the oil dumb 
our very stupidly run country better stop being so politically correct or we won't have a country to run anymore 
many generals and military leaders are now saying i told you so they say this will have big impact on military strength & national sec. 
general says that the armed forces will be severely weakened if the large scale rape and sexual abuse problem is not brought under control. 
army officer who led a sexual abuse prevention unit was just fired after being charged with violently going after his wife.what is going on? 
america's top army general has warned of a crisis unless sexual abuse in the military is quickly brought undet control.forces greatly hurt 
@icyjordan: @realdonaldtrump do you like lebron as a player and person? @kingjames lebron is a great player and a great guy

@mikemessina_: @realdonaldtrump needs to run for president he would be the best leader thanks mike. 
@lcbeaudoin big second amendment believer but background checks to weed out the sicko's are fine.

@joeypiazza way less and you are soooo stupid 
@ricksmi54256322: @realdonaldtrump i can't wait til ur president the world will be a better place if i ran and won, so true (& thanks) 
looks like we will have a pervert running for mayor after all just what new york city needs and he will revert back to form, always do

@leebandoni: @realdonaldtrump time for you to instruct the bbc to replace him, he has the personality of a tea bag 

@wvucheme: @realdonaldtrump the real shark tank is the boardroom on @apprenticenbc 
@seanheilweil: @realdonaldtrump damn you really like getting @mcuban fired up to squash you like a bug huh? he doesn't have the strength 
@damiranz: @realdonaldtrump , i'm a big fan but sometimes you just need to shut up,you talk too much probably true, but i'm having fun 
@persvanstrom based on your picture i can see why you look lost and in need of a cheap lifeline. 
@therealryanmatt: @realdonaldtrump i never seen apprentice or shark tank am i a fat loser? no, just a loser 
@mikeluis93 mark cuban is a bully who is physically very soft and therefore should immediately stop wearing t shirts. no strength 
@lord_sugar can't hold a.candle to donald.trump he is a laughing stock in great britain (but his show pays me lots of money, so i'm happy) 
the success of shark tank over the years is a total joke compared to the success of the apprentice, one of the biggest hits in t.v. history. 
@african11 but i love insulting people who don't have the goods but think they do 

@mcuban is a short ball hitter who had a massive failure on television, the benefactor. now he is one of many on a modest ratings show, s t. 
@brianlynch @durantrandy thanks, no wonder our country is in such trouble 
@lennydopkin i have not run it for many years, i sold it a long time ago (great deal, great timing). when i owned it, a top place

@noma2300 you must be kidding i kicked both of their ugly assses 
@doralaquatics: @realdonaldtrump woohoo have lived in doral for 14 years and city is excited for trump upgrades welcome thanks 
@guerrillatycoon not even close he is just, as you know, a very bad copy (who i profit from). 
@chef_riggy i never endorsed judd i'm with senator mitch all the way 
@m_plem: @realdonaldtrump @lord do you ever take the high road? when i'm dealing with garbage like @lord sugar, no

@jeremypage3011 mark cuban can't beat me at anything. he is one of many on shark tank and apprentice has been a much, much bigger show 
@2go2there: @realdonaldtrump remember that one time you came to @libertyu ? that was cool of you thanks i loved it great school 
@njwinegeek: @realdonaldtrump but jon stewart has a much higher iq. wrong, jon stewart(?) is an obnoxious lightweight with a lower i.q. 
jodi thought she outsmarted the system it didn't work congratulations to the jury on a job well done now, will it be life or death? 
@hotair25159: @realdonaldtrump lol.. justice for travis it shows that the legal system is still intact good news

@rosannascotto: why are you giving away money this am @realdonaldtrump ? because so many people need help 
@calikal69: @realdonaldtrump what do you think of @billmaher? i don't think of bill maher and nobody else does either.

@digitalpianoman: @realdonaldtrump you do more good just commenting on twitter than most haters do their whole lives 
26,000 sexual assaults or rapes reported in military last year and that is just the number that is reported (many do not want to report). 
sexual assault and rape in the armed forces is a massive problem that nobody wants to talk about or do anything about the big dark secret 
head of air force's anti sexual assault unit arrested for sexual assault it just seems that our country is not what it used to be. 

success seems to be connected w/ action. successful people keep moving. they make mistakes but they don't quit. conrad hilton

as i’ve said many times before, jon stewart @thedailyshow is highly overrated. 
jon stewart @thedailyshow is a total phony –he should cherish his past—not run from it. 
if jon stewart is so above it all & legit, why did he change his name from jonathan leibowitz? he should be proud of his heritage 
what’s funny about the name “f**kface von clownstick” it was not coined by jon leibowitz he stole it from some moron on twitter. 
amazing how the haters & losers keep tweeting the name “f**kface von clownstick” like they are so original & like no one else is doing it... 
“most people think small because most people are afraid of success, afraid of making decisions, afraid of winning” the art of the deal 
@wolfrum: @goangelo remember when @realdonaldtrump was going to sue you? i can't sue him my shirts and ties are doing great at macy's

sen. @maxbaucus has announced his retirement. a major proponent of obamacare, baucus now says it’s a ‘huge train wreck.’ 
the boston killer applying today for obamacare. he demands that medical bills be taken care of immediately. does this include dental? 
as everybody knows, but the haters & losers refuse to acknowledge, i do not wear a “wig.” my hair may not be perfect but it’s mine. 
i promise you that i'm much smarter than jonathan leibowitz i mean jon stewart @thedailyshow. who, by the way, is totally overrated.

@cindykempl: @realdonaldtrump : mr trump, i personally enjoy your tweets some are very informative thank you for your words of wisdom 
scotland does not have free press, even when you are just stating the facts it's crazy

@wlynton: @realdonaldtrump why don't you just block the morons that try annoy you? they make me feel even smarter not worth the effort 
@weskusouma: @realdonaldtrump what other attacks? read the transcripts etc. 
@coolboybrand: @realdonaldtrump they were wildin , they were creating a nuisance..and they were viciously attacking and robbing people? 
@mtomassetti22: @realdonaldtrump so should the makers of this documentary be fired? no, but they should state the true facts no angels 
@bostonred: @realdonaldtrump where is the evidence ? all over the place 
@coolboybrand: @realdonaldtrump the point of the documentary is that they were innocent they were attacking innocent people in the park , 
@fun_foy: @realdonaldtrump didn't some other guy admit to actually committing this brutal crime? yes, but they committed other attacks 
@rambofo great 
@rebeccaerin_ they were viciously attacking other people in the park nice guys?

@supadupanycee: @realdonaldtrump but they didn't do it you wished death on innocent children who were brutally attacking people in park 
@davyshanks: advertising standards authority has ruled @realdonaldtrump anti windfarm ad misleading not misleading, very truthful 
the central park five documentary was a one sided piece of garbage that didn't explain the.horrific crimes of these young men while in park 
@bitchforshort victim never died so they would not have been given death penalty but did you see what these innocent boys were doing? 
@davyshanks: advertising standards authority has ruled @realdonaldtrump anti windfarm ad misleading. political ruling to save joker salmond 
@gerhardm_com perhaps, but the country is in really big trouble i do love real estate though (and am seriously good at it).

the chinese talk of climate change and carbon footprint but don't clean up their factories but they sell us the equipment to clean up ours 
wrong, used to be called global warming and when that name didn't work, they deftly changed it to climate change because it's freezing 
@11sheila11: @realdonaldtrump why dont you just get in there and run for president? you got all our votes thanks

me, by a lot 
@doctor_trey: @realdonaldtrump i say if obama is so set on universal background checks, we run a background check on him. very interesting

@jbailey1987 yes we can oh foolish one, terrorists should not have the right to remain silent 
@shootar401: @realdonaldtrump you need to run for president and get this country back on the right track trump 2016 thank you 
@angrycrank: @realdonaldtrump you are a terrible human being. that's only because you don't know me 
my ties and shirts are doing very big numbers @macy's, beyond my wildest thoughts thanks @goangelo and the rest of the losers for mentions 



looking forward to @thegarybusey's book of buseyisms 









i hope you are watching the apprentice...tonight's show is great and brett michaels is back 
everybody loves @bretmichaels he’s a great champion and this is where he should be. he agrees 

.@traceadkins presents the nj coast red cross a $40,000 check for sandy relief. you can tell he’s very pleased about that & rightly so. 

what do you think of water boarding the boston killer sometime prior to allowing our doctors to make him well? i suspect he may talk 
make the boston killer talk before our doctors make him better. once he is well he will say, speak to my lawyers. 
don't forget to watch celebrity apprentice tonight at 9pm...you will love it 
i don't know how al michaels could have been drunk and arrested on friday night if he was totally sharp on saturday morning. 
great sportscaster al michaels, a friend of mine, played golf with me on saturday morning at trump national, la. he was in perfect shape 
if the boston killer applies for obama care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand 
no mercy to terrorists you dumb bastards 
can you imagine the boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms, legs and worse 
bullshit pop gave me knowledge and a relatively small amount of money (split between brothers and sisters) and i built it into over 9 bill. 
@bracybuilders: @realdonaldtrump just a playboy 
@coachclintswan tell me, what were they doing in the park, playing checkers? 
watch gary b tonight on celebrity apprentice some really crazy things happen 
getting back to the nicer and more normal parts of life, celebrity apprentice is great tonight on nbc at 9. it will be a full two hour show 
@ajbarker50: @realdonaldtrump do you try to make everything about you? yes 
@nextlevelstoner great 
you are right, the media is always offending donald trump they have no limits but they will do anything not to offend the boston killer 
i know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually i'm a very compassionate person (with a very high iq) with strong common sense 
didn't the boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away? we are not dealing with an innocent baby here death 
when the stupid people start feeling sorry for the boston killer and want to release him and give him medals, remember the killings maimings 
i hate when the news media, so afraid to offend anyone, always refers to the boston killer as the suspect . 
the shirts and ties at macy's are so good beautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piece l kicked his ass 
i just won a big court decision (n.y. post) against some character who claimed i owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties. 
oh no, they are worried that they didn't read the boston killer his rights and he may have a good legal argument. 12 year case to finish? t 
@joetran19: @realdonaldtrump how do u feel about marco rubio? drinks too much water 
@djmikelny: @realdonaldtrump mr. trump? how can people hate such a brilliant person? it is hard to believe, isn't it (thanks).

@mattweaver_21: @realdonaldtrump you are, quite literally, the worst human being ever. thank you 
is the boston killer eligible for obama care to bring him back to health? 
read my tweets you dopes of course he should get a trial but fast (not a 12 year disaster). 
you must be kidding zero chance he is innocent 
@mikeohio2323: @rob_bieber @realdonaldtrump tell the victims and their families about this guy's rights. terrible 
@sverriss: @realdonaldtrump what good will killing him/her do? he'll never kill again and others will start to think about consequences 
should be public execution for all to see you will end this bullshit fast 
@the_indypendent: @realdonaldtrump maybe anthony weiner can serve as editor in chief but then @cnn would become x rated 
get all the info, then quick trial, then death penalty for the boston killer of innocent children and people do not be kind. 

.@cnn should stop apologizing for the mistake they made the other day & get back to reporting

@justivanjames: the only person i enjoy following is @realdonaldtrump thanks 











what will happen to omarosa tonight? one of our all time great episodes 
i hope everyone, or rather almost everyone, had a great easter we need our leaders to make great and wise decisions in these troubled times 
so, what will happen to the big o on celebrity apprentice tonight. remember, i only fire people when it is deserved, not for other reasons 
big night on celebrity apprentice tonight. important, starts at 10 p.m. as scheduled but nbc just increased all future episodes to 2 hours 
have a great easter, i love you all 
no, i'm saying that the world is paying the price for china's pollution while they make a fortune with their dirty factories very sad. 
@kimstagliano: @realdonaldtrump when will nyt write about vaccine damage and its price? 3 girls w autism here, mr. trump. they should kim 
major article in new york times today discusses the cost of environmental damage in china and how it is rapidly growng rest of world pays. 
china is the biggest environmental polluter in the world, by far. they do nothing to clean up their factories and laugh at our stupidity 
we have tremendous economic power over china if our leaders knew how to use it, which they don't china's economy would collapse without us. 
@sullythinks: why is @realdonaldtrump not the president of the us right now? a very good question 
@thejbrain: @realdonaldtrump very well said. the united states needs people like you to show what truly leadership means so true 
@kaiser1859: @realdonaldtrump what is the solution mr trump? leadership 
what do we get from our economic competitor south korea for the tremendous cost of protecting them from north korea? nothing 
north korea is reliant on china. china could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders. 

@tonyantoine321: @realdonaldtrump great advice. yesterday, i listened to your audio book think big for the 2nd time. great

@genaleenolin thank you gln 
current @nymag really sad, not only boring but highly inaccurate. use better paper product looks like a death march (which it is ). 
@nikkio: @realdonaldtrump just read book contagious, why things catch on reminded me of u ur one of a kind :) thank you 
have a great good friday and a happy easter. 
find out who and what is the best in your field. identify the trendsetters, leaders and authorities. learn the standards they follow. 
achievers go for the challenge, so the next deal is what they're thinking about. they have an obligation to best themselves. 
wisdom comes as a result of both experience and knowledge. it's something you can't teach someone else you have to achieve it on your own. 
this week’s all star celebrity @apprenticenbc features another memorable board room rumble between @piersmorgan & @omarosa.

adam moss, editor in chief of @nymag is quickly losing his reputation in that @nymag has become so boring and so irrelevant.

terrible economic numbers released today. us gdp only grew 0.4% during oct dec 2012 quarter ://apne.ws/14ygiv4  great news for china. 
...at the same time, go through a worst case scenario but keep it short. focus on your goal—look at the solution, not the problem.

haters, stop saying i went bankrupt, it is not so. i never went bankrupt... 
... but like many other great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage. 
for the haters, out of hundreds of deals or transactions, i have used the bankruptcy laws 4 times in order to cut better deals. 
almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool... 
... icahn, kravis, apollo and most others but nobody says they went bankrupt 
people buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals... 
... it is very effective and a commonly used business tool. 
why do the losers & haters always say i wear a “wig” when they know i don’t. like it or not, it’s all mine—just ask barbara walters.

amnesty is suicide for republicans.not one of those 12 million who broke our laws will vote republican.obama is laughing at @gop. 
.@rnc report was written by the ruling class of consultants who blew the election. short on ideas. just giving excuses to donors. 
one of the most obvious lessons on @apprenticenbc is for the candidates to learn to think quickly. think like a champion 
does anyone remember the fight @mcuban had w/ the referee—he was weak & pathetic—a non athlete trying to live life thru his players. 
why do shows have @ananavarro—ntl hispanic chair for the losing mccain ’08 & huntsman ’12. she’s a loser who doesn’t deliver votes. 
sorry folks, but donald trump is far richer and much better looking than dopey @mcuban

the losing team is now back in boardroom. i can't discuss the team members or what's going on or what happens from here on out. 
re my hair should i change it? what do you think? 
it's true... dennis is really into this very animated. i have never seen him this way before. 
which team is your favorite? 
re omarosa: nasty, tough or smart...or all? 
does anyone agree with marilu that gary, while 'adorable', is a distraction? 
omarosa is very confident that the execs loved her concept & presentation. 
that's an interesting talent that marilu possesses 
next she says she's being set up by omarosa to fail....is somebody confused? 
what? latoya is saying omarosa is one of the nicest people she's met? 
on the whole, the teams seem to be working well together. no wars...yet. 
gary as the cat in the hat? he can work it out. 
what do you think of gary's definition of f u n? 
trace delivers check to hospital in nyc: american red cross must be grateful to trace and his team for their tremendous work. 
honest omarosa: she won't backstab she'll come at you from the front. 
which team do you think has the edge in this interactive photo experience task assignment? 
my 757 is incredible i think the teams agree on that. 
will team power be able to withstand omarosa as pm? smooth sailing is not expected. 
will plan b miss trace? 
firing bret was a tough one for me but omarosa doesn't seem to mind. 
omarosa always promises and delivers high drama... 
trace and his team raised an amazing amount of $. looks like a good season for charities. 
there's definitely no love lost between piers and omarosa.

... and pay per view records with “battle of the billionaires” in detroit. it was a wild day 
it is a great honor for me to be inducted into the @wwe hall of fame. this will take place on april 6... 
... at madison square garden followed by a ceremony with 80,000 people at metlife stadium, wrestlemania. 
thanks go angelo, people are now really aware of my ties, shirts, and cuff links at macy's 
.....you keep forgetting to mention the fragrance, success 
a certain whack job, go angelo, who doesn't have a life spends his time hopelessly attacking me re: macy's.... 
..... i wonder if angelo has a job or is on assistance. in any event, i'm sure he is a nice guy 
when employees are working at home they can never have the same cohesivness as working together as a group... 
... also, if they’re at home who the hell knows what they’re doing (a second job maybe). 
now i know that yahoo is in good hands. it took great courage for @marissamayer to take away the right of employees to work at home.

@rpmnana thanks, good question/good point. 
@bethosborne14 thanks. 
@jurciuoli19 i will. 
@anchantra thanks the big question is why 
.@marissamayer is right to expect yahoo employees to come to the workplace vs. working at home. she is doing a great job 
an individual, whose whole career is trying to take down successful celebrities with nonsense campaigns, has turned his attention to me..... 
...so far, he has been a complete failure at doing so. he should read the art of the deal and use his energy to focus on a new career. 
the media is so in the tank for obama that it is amazing—the funny thing is, he can’t stand them 
speaker john boehner, who i like, should never have agreed to raise taxes because the republicans got absolutely nothing for it 
almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool... 
... icahn, kravis, apollo & most others—but nobody says they went bankrupt 
people buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals.. 
.... it is a very effective & commonly used business tool. 
@roxannequintana thanks roxanne. 
@dynomike3 hi mikey work hard and good luck. 
@jaderomaine thanks and good luck 
@agrclemsonfarmn thanks al. 
@jurciuoli19 very good 
whenever one of the morons say i wear a wig, stop reading because they have no credibility & just hate.

how did you like michelle obama’s bangs last night?

by popular demand, i will be tweeting on the very tainted academy awards tonight 
i'm saying that the tea party, perhaps by another name, will soon have another big moment and will be a major factor in victory 
why didn't movie lincoln use ford's theater for big scene instead of the stage of an unrelated theater? 
big response to my tea party statement remember they were never fully energized by romney campaign and will have far more power with time. 
republicans better start listening to and respecting the tea party

.@espn’s apology(brent musburger) was a disgrace to broadcasting stop being so politically correct 
imo manti te’o was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the heisman trophy. 
can it just be new age that manti te’o fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax? 
not believable that manti te’o was in love for one year with a girl he never met she then died. he is either very stupid.... 
...or mentally troubled (or a con). 
congratulations to tom scocca and timothy burke of @deadspin for exposing the manti te’o fiasco. 

look, i have always liked lance armstrong i just hated what he did to himself, including recently. his life will now be hell. 
lance armstrong made a really big mistake by opening up to oprah. i’ll bet he wishes he had the chance to do it over again.

it is snowing in jerusalem and across lebanon. global warming 
i agree with pres. obama on afghanistan. we should have a speedy withdrawal. why should we keep wasting our money rebuild the u.s. 
everyone is starting to feel the new tax hikes. you get what you vote for 
there’s nothing “compassionate” about allowing welfare dependency to be passed from generation to generation. time to get tough 
still waiting for a response from @billmaher. does he even have $5 million? 
sadly, i’m probably helping @billmaher’s lowly rated show—but charity will benefit by $5 million so it’s worth it.

@donutsbobby @patriots you are correct 
@claudiapm7 claudia true. and happy to know the art of the deal has been helpful. 
just as i predicted, today obama called for even more tax increases. the republicans played right into his hands and blew their cards. 
remember, as a senator, obama did not vote for increasing the debt ceiling ://bit.ly/f7yqru  i guess things change when president? 
can you imagine if obama had to give today's press conference before the election? he would have lost. @gop really blew it.

dopey @billmaher is in for a lot of trouble—i hope he has $5 million (for charity). 
i am a handwriting analyst. jack lew’s handwriting shows, while strange, that he is very secretive—not necessarily a bad thing. 
the republicans have been played into a trap by the president they forgot the 14th amendment.....

just saw my new line of shirts, ties & suits @macys they are fantastic would make great holiday presents 

we just passed 1.9m followers & gained over 250,000 followers in the last month.thank you let's have fun and do business. 
@davegardiner7 @duncanbannatyne thanks, & i love the people of aberdeen. 
@boardriskman thanks 
tourism is booming because of it. rt @duncanbannatyne just been to the fantastic @realdonaldtrump golf links in aberdeen. quality stuff 
according to uk newspapers, no wind turbines have been ordered for many months in britain an obsolete technology that ruins communities 
when someone attacks me, i always attack back...except 100x more. this has nothing to do with a tirade but rather, a way of life 
i am a very calm person but love tweeting about both scum and positive subjects. whenever i tweet, some call it a tirade..totally dishonest 
trump international golf links was just rated one of the greatest courses in the world. virtually all reviews are saying the same thing.  
the people of scotland love trump international golf links. 
aberdeen tourism is booming because of my great scottish golf club.  
many political pundits are using the term art of the deal .... they should thank me. that is my term and book title. 
never ever quit, never give up donald j. trump, the art of the deal. 
thanks many are saying i'm the best 140 character writer in the world. it's easy when it's fun. 
i love twitter.... it's like owning your own newspaper without the losses. 
i'm a skeptical guy, but i don't believe petraeus used this to get out of the benghazi hearings. 
wow,  i never saw the petraeus thing coming. a straight laced guy very sad for him and his family. 
i just passed a 10 block long gas line going to lga airport, a terrible situation 
everybody wants me to talk about robert pattinson and not brian williams—i guess people just don’t care about brian 
she’s baaack @rosie needs me to salvage her dying career. but it won’t help she’s got no talent & no persona. too many tv cancellations 
price gouging at many gas stations, $10 a gallon welcome to the new world. 
it’s hard to believe that we are rationing gas in nyc. opec is laughing all the way to the bank. 
.@cyndilauper condolences on the passing of your uncle, and best wishes. 
.@antbaxter only the stupid @bbc would air your garbage—no wonder they are in such deep trouble. 
.@antbaxter anthony—did you illegally take clips from the letterman @late_show show and @golfchannel without their approval? 
.@antbaxter i predict somebody is going to sue you 
.@antbaxter dummy,thanks for increasing awareness of my big golf project in aberdeen—sales are thru the roof & aberdeen seeing big benefits. 
.@antbaxter—heard your documentary cost you less than $3,000 to make—where did you get that kind of money? 
.@antbaxter—your documentary works better than any sleeping pill—in fact that may be your only way to make money with this recycled garbage 
why do so many people say i hate president obama—i don’t hate the president at all. i just disagree with his policies 
@antbaxter @salon @antbaxter—apprentice is a huge hit all over the world. your cheap & boring documentary is a tremendous flop. 
9 million fewer people voted for obama this election than last & yet the republicans lost—do you think they might be doing something wrong 
i got to know @johnboehner very well—he is a great guy who will do the right thing for the country 
i received such a nice letter today from someone who took refuge in trump tower during sandy. it was my pleasure to help. 
robert pattinson is putting on a good face for the release of twilight. he took my advice on kristen stewart...i hope 
the election was a major setback for economy. all young entrepreneurs should be sure to calculate obama's policies into their investments. 
of the 9 battleground states, we only carried north carolina. i'm proud of @ncgop & glad i delivered keynote at their state convention. 
remember to watch the series finale of the men who built america this sunday at 8/7c on @history 
polls show that the hurricane had a huge positive effect for obama on his win isn't that ridiculous? 
romney campaign used me in 6 primary states and won every one they should have used me in florida and ohio & he would be president. 
remember to watch the series finale of the men who built america this sunday at 8/7c on @history 
china is heavily investing in building its own jet engine ://reut.rs/sx7njn  they will end up stealing the design from us as usual. 
china's submarines will soon be carrying nukes ://reut.rs/sx64do  they will be sent to patrol our coasts, obama won't do anything. 
china's communist party has now publicly praised obama's reelection. they have never had it so good. will own america soon. 
at the end of the day, obama won the battleground states by less than 500,000 votes. this was a winnable race. gop needs to do better 
with taxes set to go up and obama about to cut the mortgage deduction, now is the time to buy a house if you can. can get a great deal. 
.@davidaxelrod i'm sending you a check to help find a cure. @ivankatrump says hi. 
no surprise that all the foreign countries are celebrating obama's win. they love a weak america that they can rip off. 
obama's administration is now openly admitting it expects us credit downgraded again ://bit.ly/sx3xqk  thanks for letting us know now 
i will and i agree rt @zacharyquinto @realdonaldtrump you can't possibly make any more money. so why don't you make a difference instead? 
i started to get very worried about mitt's chances when i heard that a rod donated to his campaign. everything a rod touches turns bad. 
russian leaders are publicly celebrating obama's reelection. they can't wait to see how flexible obama will be now. 
it is that time of the year. the trump wollman skating rink is open to the public in central park. the greatest ice rink in the country. 
letterman @late_show had brian williams @nbcnightlynews as guest last night, i was on last thursday 
...i trounced him in ratings & letterman beat @jayleno last thursday. brian—are you irrelevant? 
tweet me back if u think we should start a petition to fire @hardball_chris for his comments on sandy & the death & destruction it caused. 
a test: tweet me the reason @billmaher was fired from @abc (other than his bad ratings). 
.@hardball_chris says he’s “glad” we had a hurricane with many people dying and thousands hurting, msnbc (cont) ://tl.gd/jue2m3

now that the election is over, watch chrysler ship @jeep production to china my prediction. 
it has been a pleasure to make so many friends and meet so many great people on the trail this past cycle. we will fight on 
beijing had a bigger celebration than chicago last night. the chinese are happier with the election than we are. 
the stock market and us dollar are both plunging today. welcome to @barackobama’s second term. 
congrats to @karlrove on blowing $400 million this cycle. every race @crossroadsgps ran ads in, the republicans lost. what a waste of money. 
millions without electricity across ny & nj. the media has covered for obama’s massive failure. can you imagine if this was another pres? 
pervert alert. @repweiner is back on twitter. all girls under the age of 18, block him immediately. 
amazing, various celebrities were far harsher than me with political statements but media doesn't care about... ://fb.me/21wg9mgpi  
it's freezing and snowing in new york we need global warming 
we have to make america great again 
our country is totally split right now but someday it will come together 
another four years not good for the country but we'll have to live with it 
this was the republicans election to win but they just blew it reasons why to follow. 
brian, if i'm well past the last exit to relevance how come you spent so much time reading my tweets last night? @nbcnightlynews 
brian williams was never a smart guy but always passes himself off as such. people will learn the truth @nbcnightlynews 
brian, i hope @nbcnightlynews isn't paying you too much look at what's happening to nightly news. 
brian thanks dummy i picked up 70,000 twitter followers yesterday alone. cable news just passed you in the ratings. @nbcnightlynews 
the voting booth process was a total disaster—it could and should be much better and more efficient—tremendous room for error 
this was the republicans election to win. @mittromney is a good man but he just never connected with the people. 
.@bwilliams wouldn't you love to have my ratings? 
the only thing more boring than @bwilliams newscast is his show rock center which is totally dying in the ratings—a disaster 
.@bwilliams knows that i think his newscast has become totally boring so he took a shot at me last night. 



house of representatives shouldn't give anything to obama unless he terminates obamacare. 
hopefully the house of representatives can hold our country together for four more years...stay strong and never give up 
the electoral college is a disaster for a democracy. 
our nation is a once great nation divided 
our country is now in serious and unprecedented trouble...like never before. 
this election is a total sham and a travesty. we are not a democracy 
lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice the world is laughing at us. 
we can't let this happen. we should march on washington and stop this travesty. our nation is totally divided 
well, back to the drawing board 
@dionnewarwick thanks for your nice statement on access hollywood. you are a great person and talent...i adore you 
truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains to bring it to light. george washington 
whoever wins today, remember that tomorrow we still have a country struggling. our work is not done until america is strong again. 
.@mrbelzer is a stone cold loser with no talent why did they ever put him on law and order? 
i love show law and order but the @mrbelzer casting is the worst ever. no talent unwatchable 
i have had the pleasure of getting to know @anndromney & @mittromney this past year. they love america. let's push them over the top today. 
do we still want a president who bows to the saudis and lets opec rip us off? make america strong, vote for @mittromney. 
the federal gov. has handled sandy worse than katrina. there is no excuse why people don't have electricity or fuel yet. 
.@abfalecbaldwin alec it's not science, it's a con read the e mails. 
the federal gov. has handled sandy worse than katrina. there is no excuse why people don’t have electricity or fuel yet. 
@tappersong thanks gary. 
obama thinks he can just laugh off the fact that he refuses to release his records to the american public. he can't. 
watch obama refuse to call benghazi a terrorist attack on 9.12 ://bit.ly/ysdzqy  what took @cbs so long to release this footage? 
if you experience any harassment or heckling at the polling places from obama supporters, make sure you report it immediately. 
now chinese state run companies are taking over our coal market ://on.wsj.com/yscqik  china wants to deplete our resources here at home. 
yesterday obama campaigned with jayz & springsteen while hurricane sandy victims across ny & nj are still decimated by sandy. wrong 
make sure to verify the voting machine does not switch your vote. if you have any problems, notify the poll workers. 
more reports of voting machines switching romney votes to obama. pay close attention to the machines, don't let your vote be stolen

@ngen52 i never went bankrupt. 
@jtylerdowling thanks 
@spencerljackson yes 
remember: obama turned down $5m to charity which i said i would increase by 10x to $50m just to show simple records. he's hiding lots 
if you voted for obama in 2008 to prove you were not a racist then vote for romney in 2012 to prove you are not stupid. thanks walter d 

despite the upcoming election, the cover of paper thin time magazine looks like an ad for the movie lincoln sad 
before you vote, think: obama wants to raise taxes, @mittromney wants to lower taxes need i say more 
why is obama playing basketball today? that is why our country is in trouble 
i was invited to be with mitt romney tonight win, lose, or draw, i’ll be there 
answer to your questions i will be voting at 10:30 am at lighthouse international 110 east 60th street, manhattan 
go out and vote this will be the most important election of our time 

benghazi is bigger than watergate. don’t let obama get away with allowing americans to die. kick him out of office tomorrow. 
the outer boroughs of manhattan are still devasted by sandy. how would the press cover this if a republican was president. 
china is worried. the polls are trending for @mittromney. they won’t be able to steal from us anymore. 
.@abfalecbaldwin p.s. your brother @stephenbaldwin7 is doing very well on @apprenticenbc and he stated he adores you. 
.@abfalecbaldwin they were rising in the 1950's then went back down they will go up and down through eternity. 
voting for @govgaryjohnson is voting for obama don't waste your vote 
tomorrow’s election will have historic repercussions for our country. make america strong again. vote for @mittromney. 
@mcuban do you mean the president's birthplace? 
.@mcuban letterman @late_show had his best ratings with me and you bombed. people don't care about mark cuban. 
after 13 seasons, @apprenticenbc easily beat shark tank in ratings last year better demos as well. 
.@mcuban, shark tank was shoved to friday evening friday is considered “dead television.” besides, you are not the star (& never will be). 
obama just stated it's always good to ignore donald trump. i state he is right, especially when the truth is against him. 
.@mcuban baseball commissioner and owners were smart when they didn’t want you to buy a team but i don’t think you have the money anyway. 
i believe in the america that never gives up, never stops striving, never ceases believing in itself. @mittromney, 11.2.12 
via @wsj: “a new direction for america” by @mittromney 
obama is angry, frustrated and desperate. he said “voting is the best revenge” ://bit.ly/ykwd44  he is divisive. 
@ojmart thank you 
@acman84 true 
like al sharpton, @donnydeutsch apologized to me for calling me a racist on @todayshow apology accepted 
don't believe chrysler (if obama wins) see how fast @jeep production will be moved to china and i'll be watching 

only 1 mill. dollars @mcuban? offer me real money and i’d consider it. your team and networks lose so much money i doubt you have much left 
.@mcuban tries so hard to be a star and he truly doesn't have what it takes and never will ://youtu.be/nq956tmsqgu  
dummy @mcuban is at it again trying to use me to get publicity for himself 
in ’08, america voted for hope & change. instead, we got incompetency. now it is time to put a real job creator in office. vote 4 mitt

.@cnn is looking at jeff zucker to lead them out of the forest jeff would be a great choice. 
remember, go vote we need real change this time. 
@lorrainejuliet @edltrobinson @floridajayhawk @hannityshow must be careful & smart 
@ewim55 then he wouldn't be president. 
@tricketttweeter no, his facts are very bad for him. 
@eheinlen yes. 
.@ralphreed is doing a great job 
this is a time for big ideas. this is a time for real reform for a real recovery. @paulryanvp 
remember when you vote, obamacare is a disaster 
@conedison, call gm dan scavino at 914 944 0900. 
like @conedison, obama is incompetent 
@conedison is incompetent and will have tremendous liability to briarcliff manor and trump national 
@conedison doesn't even respond to the people in briarcliff...like a forgotten area. 
@conedison is terrible...don't know what they are doing. trump national briarcliff and all houses are totally blacked out 
@mittromney will turn this mess around 
make sure you get out and vote...most important election of our generation...go romney 
trump hotels are delivering lots of food to storm victims...we love doing it 
gary johnson is asking people to waste their vote on him. make it count vote for @mittromney. 
we don’t want to have a recount in any of the battleground states. obama will steal it. make sure all your friends and family vote. 
obama's war on women has lead to the biggest decline in female employment in 40 years. 4 more years?? 
undecideds in oh,pa and wi will make the difference. all should ask themselves if they want $6/gallon gas because it will come under obama. 
pennsylvania is in play @mittromney. all undecideds in philly suburbs should ask themselves who do you trust most on @israel? 
i think @thereval should take this challenge. axelrod was too scared. rt: @ronkaufmanintrn: kaufstache vs. sharpstache. 
in the heart of the city, trump international toronto is the city's most elite property ://bit.ly/rz1yfx  true luxury at its finest. 
considering obama hasn’t proposed anything concrete, if he wins he won’t have a mandate. another 4 years of legislative stalemate. 
members from obama's own job council are endorsing @mittromney ://on.wsj.com/tofhfg  not surprising 
concerns over the national debt are stopping businesses from hiring and expanding ://onforb.es/ryzx2o  obama's policies are unsustainable 
castro, chavez and ahmadinejad are all anxiously awaiting our election results. they are praying obama wins. 
obama promised 5.2% unemployment by october 2012. his promises are worthless 
go as far as you can see; when you get there, you'll be able to see farther. j.p. morgan 
make sure to catch @history’s season finale of “the men who built america” on sun, november 11th. great show. 

could be the hurricane helps @mittromney people are rioting in the streets over gasoline 
a wonderful place. ://fb.me/1fcxekblj  
global warming is based on faulty science and manipulated data which is proven by the emails that were leaked ://onforb.es/rdpygo  
obama has destroyed the middle class. in ’09, median household income was $55,198. now it is $50,678. four more years? 
i have an idea for a rod buy a home at @trumpgolfla overlooking the pacific will bring you better luck. 
a rod is now looking for an expensive home in beverly hills why aren't the @yankees terminating his contract for misrepresentation? 
.@eagles should sit michael vick. he is a great athlete but less than average quarterback. 
obama our welfare & food stamp president, is praising himself for expanding welfare ://politi.co/sbbm1i  he doesn't believe in work. 
we don't need a secretary of business to understand business, we need a president who understands business and i do @mittromney 
unemployment is now 7.9%. four years and $6.5t later, that is really bad 
@simonsam it is trump water thanks. 
how about president obama fixing the gasoline situation instead of taking photo ops in the destruction. 
.@maggiepolitico is an unprofessional hack who belongs @politico with all the other obama hacks. 
looks like @ralphgilles is full of it. @dcexaminer: jeep, an obama favorite, looks to shift production to china ://bit.ly/pyhgmd  
interestingly, the hurricane may now be a disaster for obama's reelection because of his grandstanding. 
people are struggling to get gasoline for their cars we are like a third world country. 
i'm sending lots of bottled water out to staten island & long island. 
.@thereval came to my trump tower office to apologize for calling me a racist very nice, apology accepted 
.@barbarajwalters called my office to ask me to do election night coverage with her sadly, i won't be able to do it. 
.@ralphgilles of chrysler should focus on design rather than filthy language not very professional. 
we should not allow @chrysler to move @jeep jobs to china after they said they wouldn't stay tuned 
.@chrysler disputes my statement but watch chrysler move @jeep jobs to china after the election. 
with long gas lines & total disarray from storm, the hurricane may yet be a negative for obama. 
it was announced this morning that unemployment rose this can't be good for obama. 
next year i will be changing the name of 800 acre doral to trump national doral. it will be the best resort in the country—miami is hot 
i will start reviewing various political reporters etc & websites as to their professionalism & fairness—many people asking for this. 
how could obama leave those american heroes out to die in benghazi? and he continues to lie to the public 
what is your thought as to why obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications? 
nice to see obama released a situation room photo from sandy. how about releasing the photo taken during benghazi? 
everybody knows why obama would not show his college applications they are just not willing to say 
if i would have offered obama a billion dollars to show his records, he would have refused. 
my video response to president obama's lack of transparency. ://youtu.be/tygw3_w3ts8?hd=1 … 
press release. video response to follow. ://fb.me/1tv6gas8b  
i will soon be releasing my response to the fact that president obama refused to show his applications and records to the public. 
president obama missed the deadline 
obama is a terrible negotiator. he bails out chrysler and now chrysler wants to send all jeep manufacturing to china and will 
why is obama’s auto bailout now creating jobs in china? he is ruining american industry. 
to all @mittromney supporters, make sure you have taken advantage of early voting now so you can gotv on election day. 
“romney’s $2 billion sacrifice for america” by chris ruddy @newsmax_media ://bit.ly/y0cs8p  
you know the world is crazy when new york gets hit by a hurricane and florida doesn't. 
let's continue to destroy the competitiveness of our factories & manufacturing so we can fight mythical global warming. china is so happy 
do you believe @algore is blaming global warming for the hurricane? 
from 1954 to 1960 there were 10 major hurricanes that hit the east coast. 
it's 10 am: two hours to go for obama to easily pick up millions for charity 
the successful man will profit from his mistakes and try again in a different way. dale carnegie 
@stass13 thanks 
obama is now standing in a puddle acting like a president give me a break. 
a lot of people are concerned about which charity my $5m will be donated to. the onus is on obama to first release his records. 
president obama, if it is important to you, i will substantially increase the $5m offer 
president obama, please take the $5m check for charity tomorrow. it is so easy and could do so much good 

congratulations to @mittromney on getting the @dmregister, @newyorkpost, @newyorkobserver & @nashuatelegraph endorsements 
spoiler @dennisrodman has really got his act together so far on the upcoming season of @celebapprentice... 

how does a dummy like @billmaher get a television show & his ratings stink. you'd think @hbo could do a lot better. 
a lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with obama’s lack of transparency. i don't blame them. 
there is nothing i would be happier to do than to donate the $5m to a charity of obama’s choice, once he releases all of his records. 
looking at the figures and plans behind @disney's acquisition of lucas film makes you realize how stupid @aol (cont) ://tl.gd/jrhicg  
.@disney's acquisition of lucas film is a smart deal for both sides. disney just bought a great brand which will keep producing revenue. 
in the spirit of transparency, obama should immediately release the 9.11 tape of tyrone woods pleading for military support in benghazi. 
today barack obama is standing in water in nj. remember on election day that he has put the us underwater. 
how many illegal foreign donations will obama collect this final week? another scandal ignored by the liberal media. ://bit.ly/rpmehp

watch the clip from @late_show where the crowd cheers after i explain that my offer is about transparency ://bit.ly/vmsnc6  
i'm not hearing much from obama or his administration about my $5m offer to charity or to which charity the money will go. 
the president has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5m for his favorite charity. looking like he won't be doing it. what is he hiding? 
watch me tonight on late night with jimmy fallon. photo: lloyd bishop/nbc ://fb.me/a7uolapi  
the polls & momentum are trending towards @mittromney. don't let the hurricane change your thinking 
fans shouldn't worry. we have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of @celebapprentice appropriately due to the storm. 
china’s stock market rose yesterday after 4 consecutive days of losses ://bloom.bg/v4szxj  their market gains the day we are hit by storm 
maybe obama should donate my $5m to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm? 
scary. obama and the democrat senate have accrued over $5t worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years. 4 more years? 
people are happy that i left the trump tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out. ://fb.me/1ectzpju0  
why does obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? hiding something? 
@digiphile @redcross rt if you think pres.obama should release his records to get $5m for charity for red cross or another great charity 
glad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co hosting the grammy nominations special on 12.5. taylor is terrific 
let’s be honest, if obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm, then he would have been in ohio on monday. 
how did obama go to a las vegas fundraiser on 9.12, the day after he refused to send help to americans in benghazi? 
without focus, it's just impossible to be successful at anything. midas touch 
i never fall for scams. i am the only person who immediately walked out of my ‘ali g’ interview 
another great cause obama could send my $5m donation to is a charity for 9/11 first responders. they are american heroes.

the election is trending towards @mittromney. americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the obama economic decline. 
so many incredible friends said thanks for tt help i say thanks to you ://fb.me/ypkox0ze  
the trump tower atrium is such a great place & kept thousands of people warm & safe during the storm thanks, staff 
.@matthewlumby charity should get the money 
@neilmsdunn dopey, few have built more than me. 
remember this: obama wants to raise taxes, @mittromney wants to lower taxes need i say more 
don't let obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states. 
people having a great time in the trump tower atrium unlike others, i stayed open. ://fb.me/28ipnxfqk  
i am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap, i would have been lambasted from coast to coast. 
because of the hurricane, i am extending my 5 million dollar offer for president obama's favorite charity until 12pm on thursday. 
not only giving out money, but obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real president don't fall for it. 
hurricane is good luck for obama again he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars. 
i saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm. 
the water damage to nyc is amazing. the winds were bad but the water was worse. 
all weights are on crane's wrong side very precarious below, move out 
if authorities need direct view from top of trump tower, call office. 
direct view of crane from apartment window. crane was never properly secured, blowing in the breeze. ://fb.me/1ybwhz6bk  
we are taking care of hundreds of people in the trump tower atrium they are seeking refuge. free coffee and food. 
so far the hurricane is being handled very well in ny, not nearly as bad as stated on news. let's see what happens later. 
many people walked out on madonna's concert when she told them to vote for obama. years ago i walked out because the concert was terrible 
i always said obama is lucky for himself but unlucky for the country. the storm could be very good for him as he (cont) ://tl.gd/jqnh3f  
obama lied 100% about libya and the killings emails are absolute. he must release his records on wednesday and stop the lies. 
dave letterman @late_show said during my interview that obama was probably born in the us the word probably is a disaster for obama. 
i'm not hearing much from obama or his administration about my $5m offer to charity or to which charity the money will go.

i guess @billmaher saw my ratings on the @late_show the other night where letterman beat leno. bill, you are no letterman. 
while @bettemidler is an extremely unattractive woman, i refuse to say that because i always insist on being politically correct. 
.@bettemidler talks about my hair but i'm not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body so i won't. is this a double standard? 
but whenever she sees me, she kisses my ass. she's disgusting. @bettemidler 
i never liked @bettemidler's persona or singing and haven't heard her name in years. 
now grotesque @bettemidler is into the trump act trying to become relevant again. 
many people are saying that my challenge to obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers i agree. 
a lot changed when david letterman said he was probably born in this country the word probably is a total disaster for obama.

@bernard mcguirk thanks for being so nice and defending me on o'reilly...you're terrific 
alert...the president knew that the ambassador was being attacked in benghazi. he did nothing...he is no leader. 
@donnydeutsch tries so hard to be a star. but, he just doesn't have what it takes...and he never will. 
i put @donnydeutsch on apprentice at his request, i did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my obama announcement. 
i want to end the day by saying there is no check i would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our president. 
the today show should call me about who to put on the show— i know more about people who get ratings than anyone.

if obama doesn't accept my offer to be fully transparent, what will he say? 
if my offer is refused, every undecided oh voter will be fully aware that obama denied $5m to charity all because he is hiding something

i have decided to add a caveat to my offer. obama can't decide to send my $5m to rev. wright if he releases his records. 
my fellow tea party friends in ohio make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can gotv election day. know you can must win ohio. 
where's the transparency? despite obama's denial @sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with jeremiah wright. 

pretty audacious for obama to call @mittromney a bser when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write. 
by the way, where is @oprah? good question. 4 years ago she strongly supported obama now she is silent. anyway, who cares, i adore oprah. 
...colin powell thought iraq has weapons of mass destruction. 
obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. the middle east is a mess. yet colin powell still endorses him. wonder why? 
be careful of an obama bomb to win election would be a horrible thing to do. 
the election is still close but trending toward @mittromney. he leads all national polls and obama's likeability is imploding. vote

@mikempef thanks, i hope you enjoyed it, had a great time. 
@destiny_113 @stephenathome i agree. 
@maureenperonne @late_show thanks, it was a great show.. 
@mrjmf1 @late_show thanks i will.

...a real loser named tim o'brien and it's never recovered. 
dopey arianna @huffingtonpost is really after me boring story after boring story...but i hear she is in big trouble 
i knew last year that @time magazine lost all credibility when they didn't include me in their top 100... 
... i will soon start naming magazines that i think will fold i predicted newsweek. 
@yewkalaylee great idea. 
@seketa77 i hope so for the charity's sake 
@tylarreese thanks tylar 
the letterman show really turned things around people finally understand my $5 million dollar offer to charity.... ://fb.me/sxjxchsu  
@lianneonlife i love the wounded warriors obama should choose that as his $5m charity. 
@ryanseven sounds like a good idea. 
@erizzle05 only because he has something to hide. 
.@sabrinasiddiqui re: taylor and conor great news for taylor 
based on the ovation last night from the letterman @late_show audience, i believe it will be hard for obama to throw $5m down the drain.... 
....instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause. 
another great charity that the $5m could go to just a recommendation to the pres. the wounded warriors represented so well by @traceadkins 
lots of response that obama should give the $5m to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in benghazi. 
letterman @late_show was great last night. i had a lot of fun. you could see his audience really wanted obama to take the $ for charity. 
the dealmaker is cunning, secretive, focused and never settles for less than he wants. the america we deserve 
it is really a shame that barack obama may stop $5m from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent. 
doing david letterman @late_show tonight at 11:30. 1st nite of sweeps.going into the lion's den but i've been there many times before. enjoy 
six days and counting until my offer to barack obama expires... 
for someone who demanded 20 years of mitt's tax returns, you would think my offer to donate $5m to charity for his records is an easy go. 
yesterday barack obama said he wants wind turbines manufactured here in china ://youtu.be/puvobswnwbe  i don't think this was a gaffe. 
china is primed to continue to rob us and steal our jobs through their exports ://reut.rs/swrtee  we need @mittromney to rein them in.

what will be the response on wednesday? if obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity. 
@michellemalkin i fully supported mccain but when he lost, hoped obama would be great for u.s. he wasn't. 
.@mark_sanchez shouldn’t be too upset over @evalongoria. he will always do great 
i am offering the chance for barack obama to redistribute $5m to any charity of his choice. everyone wins. take the deal. 
“our side needs donald trump.” @anncoulter on @seanhannity’s show last night. thanks ann. 
.@barbarajwalters @theviewtv why did you choose me as one of the 10 most fascinating people of the year last season (and more than once?) 
.@barbarajwalters @theviewtv will apologize to me just like she did when i was right about @rosie. besides, i get great ratings on the view. 
.@barbarajwalters @theviewtv barbara, unfortunately you've missed the entire point of my announcement you just don't get it 
still waiting for an explanation about why @giulianarancic & @billrancic did not name their son donald. unbelievable. 
miss universe 2012 pageant will be airing live on @nbc & @telemundo december 19th. open invite stands for robert pattinson.

how does @michellemalkin get a conservative platform? she is a dummy just look at her past. 
the @dailybeast will die just like newsweek same management. 
the fact that we still don't know these things about barack obama is the point. @monicacrowley on @seanhannity's show last night.

glad to hear north carolina is solid for @mittromney. it started trending for mitt solidly after my speech at the @ncgop convention. 
in light the benghazi emails released last night, it is apparent that obama has no problem lying to the american public... 
... by releasing his records, he can come clean with the american people and have $5 million go to a charity. 
obama has no problem leaking national security secrets. why can't he release his records? especially when $5m is going to charity. 
i am happy to donate $5 million to a charity barack obama chooses. all i am asking is that he is transparent with the american people 

i just learned that @politico has no credibility total phonies that don't report the truth. a puppet of obama? 
glad to hear @seanhannity supports my offer to obama. as sean says “it is an easy $5 million to charity. what does obama have to lose?” 
third rate @politico took every negative tweet or response they could find & put it out when in fact the response is incredibly positive. 
my offer to obama is about transparency. in 2008, american people were sold on hope and change. this our last chance to get the full record.

.@bobschieffer did an excellent job as debate moderator last night. i only wish mitt was more aggressive 
everyone is asking me to speak more on robert & kristen.i don't have time except to say robert, drop her, she cheated on you & will again 
last night was the first time obama said we instead of i in respect to bin laden's killing. 
barack obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after bin laden now he wants all of the credit 
my announcement is tomorrow 
tomorrow i will be tweeting on only one subject 
china will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own 
mitt romney must start congratulating the navy seals and military on bin laden’s killing, not the president.

lance armstrong fought for 7 years & then just ran out of energy. very sad story although they caught him red handed.he definitely cheated 
casting sometimes is fate and destiny more than skill and talent, from a director's point of view. steven spielberg 
no matter what happens in the election, @davidaxelrod deserves a lot of credit. he has kept obama in it, even with his terrible record. 
i always said that @lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges. by stopping, he gave his enemies an opening. 
70% of the chinese say they are better off than they were 4 years ago ://bit.ly/qnfhnm  at least someone has done well under obama. 
the debate was pretty even but i thought mitt should have been much more aggressive on obama's failed foreign policy and i mean much more. 
debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. viewership will be way down. 
i will be doing @squawkcnbc at 7:30. 

.@mittromney looks much calmer, and obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward. 
bob schieffer will do a great job tonight. always treated me fairly. 
well this is it, the final debate let's see how it goes. i'll be tweeting live. 
i have watched @linda_mcmahon for years she will bring jobs & business back to connecticut incredible woman

@brandonthrill thanks a great compliment. 
@trottofficial thanks and doing great business from all over the world. 
why don't we ask the navy seals who killed bin laden? they don't seem to be happy with obama claiming credit. all he did is say o.k. 
.@piersmorgan keeps winning the ratings race @cnn ://bit.ly/qngodd  that’s why he is a @celebapprentice champion 
i look forward to @mittromney hitting obama hard tonight for lying about benghazi. cia told obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs. 
everybody is asking about my announcement this wednesday concerning barack obama just wait and see 
.@bobschieffer will a great job tonight he is a real pro and respected by both sides. 
according to @sfgate, obama spoke to rev. wright about getting out the black vote ://bit.ly/qndeiu  no surprise that they still speak... 
everyone knows i am right that robert pattinson should dump kristen stewart. in a couple of years, he will thank me. be smart, robert. 
obama is an easy target on foreign policy.@mittromney has many openings to attack, especially when obama starts bragging about bin laden.

clinton commented in ohio today that @mittromney is right, the economy has not been fixed under obama.i always said bill was an honest man. 
when strasburg leaves @nationals for another team for more money, will washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good? 
bad sign for obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states. their internals must be horrendous. 
while the next season of @celebapprentice is packed w/ all stars, ours fans will be happy to see @joan_rivers in the board room.she is back 
derek jeter @yankees wants to rent an apartment. derek only in a trump building trump is lucky for you. 
now there is talk of a rod being shipped to @marlins. if a rod is not a @yankee next year, the fans will be happy. 
i think the @yankees will win today. unlike a rod, cc is good under pressure. i hope a rod plays, however. 
@nickj102 @antbaxter i don't want to fall asleep in public. 
robert i'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump kristen but i'm right. if you saw the miss universe girls you would reconsider.

@antbaxter @mailonline they only suffered by watching your 3rd rate documentary (which bombed). 
@jeff_coles i will thanks. 
lots of response to my pattinson/kristen stewart reunion. she will cheat again 100 certain am i ever wrong? 
looking forward to honoring the great dogan family & the success of the trump towers project in istanbul @followturkey annual gala dinner 
alert us jobless claims up 46,000 to 388,000. really bad news. 7.8% is now a fraud not possible 
amazing my tweets are covered across every spectrum from @espn to @politico to @wsj. 
when we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $5 trillion of deficits over the last four years. @mittromney 
obama's spending and borrowing is burying america and destroying our children's future. does he even care? 

great now supreme court justices are talking about a constitutional right to a cell phone ://bit.ly/wn22kq  obama, just stop already. 
.@ashleycam2883 re: libya hillary took the blame for obama.

under his administration, oil and gas production on public land is down over 10% ://wapo.st/qqo8ln  obama did not tell truth last night. 
if obama goes after mitt's private sector experience in the next debate then mitt should ask for obama's college records all of them.

what is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all. we should be given credit for taking this risk. 
can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight? 
robert pattinson should not take back kristen stewart. she cheated on him like a dog & will do it again just watch. he can do much better 
michael vick of the philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback. 
initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped. see what happens when i am not mentioned. 
just read about my friend @hulkhogan he was set up too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles. 
@billrancic bill you should have named your beautiful son donald. 
joe girardi @yankees must play his starters, even a rod, they got you there. 
while the @yankees look like they quit and are finished, they won't quit for cc 
last saturday a rod was 0 3 and left 6 stranded. but he was still hitting on girls from the dugout ://bit.ly/r9tbnh  he is very selfish 
cc is a great pitcher and can handle pressure @yankees will win tonight. so far my predictions have all been correct. 
george steinbrenner @yankees would have gotten out of a rod's contract three years ago...but put a rod in tonight. 
obama talks about what he is going to do why the hell didn't he just do it, especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary 
obama at big debate disadvantage he just can't get away from his bad record. 
.@mittromney scored last night on both substance and style. 
trump was right: 'obama's america' tops 2012 documentaries ://bit.ly/wn8h77  via @newsmax_media 
...bad decisions can be devastating. 
obama was beaten but not knocked out. he lives to fight another day. but in the real world presidents are not given a second chance... 
all the guys that said @mittromney would lose are rapidly coming on board. mitt will remember the early helpers. 
if obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically, environmentally & aesthetically. 
robert bryce @nypost congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines & how destructive they are. windmills are a disaster. 
remember, new environment friendly lightbulbs can cause cancer. be careful the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care. 
wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds, they are killing the finances & environment of many countries & communities. 
great article on wind turbines by robert bryce in today's @nypost ://bit.ly/v5awvj  
really enjoyed discussing @yankees yesterday with @realmicihaelkay. i am a long time yankee fan.

@marileenelson thanks 
my interview with @realmichaelkay discussing why a rod should be fired from @yankees & how to terminate his contract ://es.pn/ctby8e  
my twitter followers will soon be over 2 million & all the biggies. it's like having your own newspaper. 
my twitter has become so powerful that i can actually make my enemies tell the truth. 
polls are starting to look really bad for obama. looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win. don't put it past him 
obama did much better than he did last time but still lost decisively. 
do you believe barack hussein obama (aka barry soetoro) looked like a president last night? i don't 
obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. if we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period 
i still love derek, he is a winner 
remember, i said derek don't sell your trump world tower apartment...its been lucky for you. the day after he sold it, he broke his foot. 
at the debate, the president kept talking of what he is going to do. i kept saying, why didn't he do it? he lost me a long time ago. 
verlander pitched great, but @yankees look truly defeated. 
stupid george will gave @mittromney no chance 3 months ago. take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy. 
george will said best debate he ever saw . if you ever heard george will speak(boring) anything is exciting. 
debate showed these guys really hate each other. at one point it looked like they would come to blows.  

you talk tough, mr. president, but have done nothing about china killing our jobs and economy. 
such long rhetorical and boring answers from obama. no wonder nothing gets done. 
.@mittromney much better on libya and middle east problems. obama has no answer. 
obama keeps namedropping bill clinton he is no bill clinton. 
obama weak on immigration. all words, no action. he's been prez 4 years. 
obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @mittromney is looking strong and sharp. 
obama just said @mittromney was a very successful investor big mistake for obama to admit he has less and less credibility. 
obama keeps saying that he will do something but why hasn't he done it? it's all talk. 
.@mittromney looks much stronger and much more presidential 
then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices? 
good response on jobs by @mittromney. 
why has obama let china and others take our jobs? 
why hasn't obama created jobs? 
getting ready to watch the debate as they say let's get ready to rumble 
i was just told by one of the top @pgatour players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country. very nice compliment i agree. 
we should be able to negotiate a deal with iran because they know we could blow them away to the stone age.they just don't believe we would. 
@drumline_mormon it is selling great at macy's thanks 
for political purposes only, obama is planning to hit libya for the benghazi embassy attack right before the election? 
great win last night by peyton manning & @denver_broncos in san diego coming from 24 points behind on the road. very impressive. 
if the @yankees can somehow beat verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series. and i will go to games 6& 7 so they will win 
get ready for tonight 
@missusa olivia we love you. you are doing a great job. 
.@mittromney if obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records & transcripts he will quiet down quickly. 
good luck @mittromney tonight have no doubt you will be great. 
congratulations to @jamesokeefeiii on exposing more democrat voter fraud. @dnc was caught red handed telling people to vote twice. 
i bet the terrorists in libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in benghazi. 
.@washtimes @brettmdecker: five questions w/ @realdonaldtrump 'lack of leadership is the biggest threat to america' ://bit.ly/qmeogb  
between libya, the national security leaks and fast & furious, obama has had more national security scandals than any other president. 
.@reince is doing a fantastic job for the republican party hope he gets the credit he deserves. 
.@antbaxter i tried watching but fell asleep. 
.@history's wonderful the men who built america with me on tonight at 9 bad timing, i'll be live tweeting the debate 
because obama was so pathetic in the first debate, tonight's audience will be humongous people want to see if he is for real. 
the coca cola company is not happy with me that's okay, i'll still keep drinking that garbage. 
it's amazing my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @cnbc draw the highest ratings. and they get bigger week by week thanks folks 
had a great time with @paulryanvp last night on the intrepid. paul is terrific. 
obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. at least he is consistent. 
all the morons that cause the controversy in scotland have made my development far more successful than anticipated. 

diet coke tweet had a monster response dammit, i wish the stuff worked. 
.@antbaxter thanks for helping promote & make trump international golf links scotland so successful you stupid fool 
.@antbaxter your documentary died many deaths. you have, in my opinion, zero talent. 
i can confirm the reports @billrancic, my first season winner, will be returning to this all star season of @celebapprentice. 
.@rupertmurdoch is absolutely right, it will be a nightmare for @israel if obama is re elected. 
verlander is great but very beatable. does not have a good era in playoff games 
i turned down going to the debate tonight so that i could do live tweets to my many followers. 
i have no doubt that mitt will do really well tonight. we'll all be watching @mittromney. 
lots of pressure on obama tonight even more than a rod. if he doesn't perform well it could be over. 
i hope a rod has a great night for the yankees he owes it to them especially with derek hurt. 
@jbluvx2 happy birthday 
gov. gary johnson pulling votes from @mittromney don't waste your vote. obama must go

obama is planning on attacking romney on bain in tomorrow's debate ://fxn.ws/ri8uwe  mitt should bring up college applications & records 
romney, ryan slam obama administration on china currency manipulation ://abcn.ws/qnbocf  via @abc 
once again obama fails to classify china as a currency manipulator. he just helped china steal even more jobs and money from us. 
looking forward to honoring the great dogan family and the success of the trump towers project in istanbul @followturkey annual gala dinner 
a rod should donate his contract to charity. he doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform. he is a $30m/yr rip off. 
looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @mittromney supporters at the intrepid. mitt's doing well.

.@arsenioofficial why not everyone else is using it it's available at @macys. 
@schroedboss @erichfschroeder and your parents meant the world to me 
a rod was a great player when he lived at trump park avenue even though he was on the juice 
@mcginness1 thanks a great country 
derek jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at trump world tower i told him not to sell karma? 
.@sbelsbel3555 sorry, @piersmorgan is a very smart guy 
.@erichfschroeder your dad was a great man & great leader. 
@leighannmac thank you 
i love @libertyuniversity such great people 
a rod is just not making it. we want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great. 
i feel guilty not having attended the last two @yankees games (losses). they would have won 
obama will be trying very hard at next debate he doesn't want to lose the boeing. 
who says obama will do better in the next debate has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks 
.@mittromney's poll numbers are looking really good. one more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout.  
i have never seen a thin person drinking diet coke. 
no, i wasn't at the @yankees game yesterday can't go today either. when i go, they win. 
brooklyn nets have the worst uniform ever boring won't matter if they win( winning solves all problems (cont) ://tl.gd/jl71lk  
yankees can win today. kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher. 
a rod hit ball hard first at bat. time for him to step up and leave. 
swisher should have caught ball in right field last night. 
.@yankees are in trouble without derek. try a rod at short get him some confidence. 
a bad thing finally happened to derek jeter he is a great champion. 
so much for washington shutting down strasburg they deserved to lose. 
roadway steel on beautiful verrazano narrows bridge is rusting and rotting away. scrape and paint before too late. 
tonight, despite everything, put a rod in the lineup.  
everyone's wondering what's wrong with a rod. not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore the real reason.  
they found jessica in colorado body was mutilated death to the pervert killer. 
joe girardi did a great job of managing the yankees this series. 
i'll bet obama goes down just like washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win. 
washington should have brought in strasburg to relieve they would have won. 
when strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency washington will say what were we doing . 
i told you, whenever i go to a @yankees game the @yankees win. 
leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality. warren g. bennis 
when an employee leaves me and begs to come back i never let them. loyalty is very important. 
i look forward to tuesday night's presidential debate i wonder if obama will use my name again. 
very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate. 
what we are watching on our tv screens is the unraveling of the obama foreign policy. @paulryanvp 
obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families. the price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected. 
with our amazing all star cast, @joan_rivers, @johnrich, @arsenioofficial & @piersmorgan are also returning as boardroom advisors. 
great to hear that our loyal @celebapprentice fans are happy with today's announcement of the new cast. this will be something special 
.@dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act. 
i'm going to the @yankees game tonight to root them on they always win when i am there. 
my scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world a great honor for me. 

doing the @todayshow with @mlauer was great i really like matt. 

there are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still. pres. franklin d. roosevelt 
@dennisrodman @apprenticenbc great to have you back for the best season yet 
obamacare is a complete disaster. many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it. terrible.

amazing that derek jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well. 
$30m a year and a rod is now relegated to the bench. @yankees would have lost if girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction) 
i guess they have lance armstrong cold. brutal report. a waste of taxpayer money to take down an american hero. 
.@apprenticenbc cast will be announced tomorrow at 7:30am et on the @todayshow with @mlauer 
staff at trump park avenue disliked a rod to put it mildly the staff at trump world tower loves derek jeter.

has barack obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations? media? 
i just had to fire someone, he didn't have a clue he reminded me of obama on wednesday night. 
27 days until america's greatest test since our founding. in this election, we decide whether we become great again. 
it doesn't matter who you vote for it matters who is counting the votes. be careful of voter fraud 
obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate. let's see how he reacts under pressure. 
remember, obama limped across the finish line he should have lost to hillary. be careful 
i don't think obama will do well in the second debate he is psyched out just like a rod.

.@davidletterman @late_show fully apologized last night for calling me a racist. thank you david we are again friends. 
the public is about to learn a lot more information on barack obama and his true background in the coming weeks… 
now that obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in libya or iran. he is desperate. 
mitt’s subsequent rise in the polls post debate shows that the american public can still spot a real winner. 
“in order to build your wealth and improve your business smarts, you need to know about real estate.” think like a billionaire 
with these record high gas prices, what does it say about obama that he was trying to brag about his energy policy in the debate? 
looking forward to live tweeting during the rest of the debates. will be a lot of fun.

@fstltd @tonyrobbins will be a great event. see you in london. 
both being optimistic and remembering the big picture have served me well throughout my life. you need to stay positive. 
.@sethmacfarlane will be a great oscar host. he did an amazing job at my @comedycentral roast. 
@ajb073 thank you. 
wind farms are ugly, not cost effective and don't produce worthwhile returns or energy. no wonder governments are giving up on them. 
as a big job creator, i was greatly honored to have been mentioned twice tonight during the debate. 
congratulations to mitt romney. he was not only good, he was absolutely fantastic tonight 
invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the attack. sun tzu

in august, 2012, obama said the so called arab spring sprung from 'joyful longing for human freedom' ://bit.ly/pwwbpp  good call 
have you heard? china just told obama to jump. obama asked how high. 
obama's '07 speech which @dailycaller just released not only shows that obama is a racist but also how the press always covers for him. 
i'm always amazed when i travel to my foreign properties.seeing the trump brand across 4 continents proves that excellence can be universal.

under obama, iran has taken over iraq, al qaeda has taken over libya, the muslim brotherhood now controls egypt. worst foreign policy ever. 
woody johnson's comments that he would rather have @mittromney win the election than his @nyjets win games shows real patriotism.

with obama and bernanke destroying the value of the dollar, gold and real estate should continue to rise in value. 
the attack on our libyan consulate was the worst attack on the us since 9/11. time for obama to come clean. 
despite all of china's cheating, they are not doing that well we can beat them our country has great potential 
all these polls released by news outlets are oversampling democrats. they want to influence public perception of the race. 
the emmys are all politics, that's why, despite nominations, the apprentice never won even though it should have many times over. 
amazing race winning an emmy again is a total joke. the emmys have no credibility no wonder the ratings are at record lows. 
despite the emmy's being terrible as a show, @jimmykimmel was excellent and i think his late night show will be a hit.

@steelchecker jody agreed. 
rt @mittromney: for nearly 4 years, barack obama has refused to crack down on china's cheating & american workers have paid the price. 
why doesn't obama let our marines who are guarding the embassies in egypt have live ammunition? they need it fast. 
it's amazing @hardball_chris has completely lost all connections to reality. he is a complete shill for obama.

the media is pathetic. our embassies are savaged by radicals while obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @mittromney. 
what a coincidence that obama's good friends in libya and egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies. 
with allies like egypt and libya, who needs enemies? 
shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11?

china is happy to learn that @barackobama plans to borrow another $300 billion. @barackobama is their favorite client. 
if only speeches could create jobs then @barackobama wouldn't have such a dismal economic record.

america needs a tough negotiator not a community organizer. 
why was @barackobama selling guns to mexican drug dealers? 
a robust growing economy is how to fix social security and medicare not cuts on seniors. 
us should have told libya rebels give us 50% of your oil for our military support.

@barackobama wishes speeches could create jobs. his job is costing america all of ours. 
fast and furious gun running goes all the way to the white house. we need answers now 
oil is double the price now compared to last year opec is laughing at @barackobama. 
fast and furious put semi automatics in the hands of mexican drug lords that killed americans @barackobama should answer all questions. 
the white house is predicting 9% unemployment throughout 2012 – and when obama care takes effect in 2014 expect it to go even higher. 
make no mistake fast and furious goes all the way to the white house. 
@barackobama is so inept that i think he simply made a mistake in originally scheduling the joint session on september 7th. just sad. 
my interview with @gretawire last night everything obama does is a 'campaign speech' ://fxn.ws/omlgmc  
we must stand firm against the un's ploy to sabotage israel if the un grants the pa statehood then we must immediately defund it. 
i'll be on greta van susteren's show tonight at 10 pm on foxnews. tune in. 
with gas prices rising and the economy failing, @barackobama seeks to have his epa raise energy prices by $109b ://bit.ly/oeldog  
libya is being taken over by islamic radicals with @barackobama's open support. 

china's business interests reach far and wide even domestically within our borders. we need to reassess our relationship. 
the new libyan government should turn over the lockerbie bomber now. 
obamacare must be fully repealed or it will destroy america's small businesses. 
if the un unilaterally grants the palestinians statehood, then the us should cut off all its funding. actions have consequences. 
if the palestinians want statehood then why are they run by the terrorist group hamas? 
crude is at $85 right now – isn’t even worth half that. opec is ripping us off. 
@barackobama must release a budget before @johnboehner begins negotiations on a continuing appropriations resolution. 
iran admits to aiding the libyan rebels and ahmadinejad received a letter of thanks when will washington learn? ://bit.ly/paspy1  
libyan rebels should have given us 50% of the oil in return for our military support we don't even ask 

more and more americans seem fed up with both parties i agree. 
there is no substitute for private sector experience. 
why did @barackobama and his family travel separately to martha's vineyard? they love to extravagantly spend on the taxpayers' dime.

china's corporate espionage is a continued threat to the american economy. with the right leadership, it can be stopped. 
@barackobama inherited $10.6 trillion in national debt will leave after his first term with the debt at over $17.6 trillion.

israel is being barraged by rockets from gaza recently. they must respond accordingly in defense of their citizens. 
@barackobama is sure a master delegator. he has sent @joe_biden to china. the chinese are laughing at us. we must do better. 
@barackobama’s new job plan will certainly do the following – 1. not create any jobs. 2. borrow more money from china.

reporters say it's the trump bump i tell cnbc i am buying stocks and the market goes up. 
economic growth can save social security, medicare and america. 
mike huckebee, a great guy, said the president should appoint me treasury secretary. china and opec would not be happy. 
ron paul is right that we are wasting trillions of dollars in iraq and afghanistan. 
obama has no understanding of how to create jobs or opportunity. he believes in government. 
it's easy to see why americans are sick of career politicians and both parties.

the more you learn about the debt deal, the worse it gets. 

republicans and democrats have both created our economic problems. 
why should we have any defense cuts in any deal? america must remain strong. 
this is the best deal the republicans could get? 
disappointed in gop and dems giving obama power to raise the debt limit next year is a mistake. 
ex presidential pollster pat cadell says most voters sick of both parties and their failure. 
we need economic growth and jobs not blue ribbon panels to study the problem. 
no taxes in boehner or reid plan important victory for america. 
watched sean hannity last night a great guy. 
if obama has to re fight this fight next year he loses watch the fine details in every deal the art of the deal 
blue ribbon commission to find and agree to future spending cuts? bad idea. 
never quit and always hit back the art of the comeback

@barackobama has not released his own debt plan yet. he's totally lost, ineffective, desperate. gop has its best chance to make a great deal 
my wife melania trump's show was a tremendous success last night. in case you missed her, you can see her again tonight on @qvc at 7 pm et

my interview from yesterday on fox and friends gop crazy if they don't get everything they want ://bit.ly/nksbbf 

fiscal mismanagement of cash costing us taxpayer billions cut fraud and waste before cutting funding for seniors. 
obama, sadly, has no business or private sector background and it shows. 

the answer to both social security and medicare is a robust growing economy not cuts on the elderly. 
we need a balanced budget amendment because congress has no fiscal discipline. 
unfortunately@barackobama's continued attack on the us $ will lead to ever rising gas prices at the pump and lots of other really bad things 
ronald kessler's new book the secrets of the fbi is a great book that should be read by everyone.

china is our enemy they want to destroy us redstate interview 
obama is addicted to spending america into insolvency. his record proves it. 
robust economic growth is the answer to the medicare problem not cuts on the elderly. 
while @barackobama seeks to further destroy our credit, our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. such a total failure as a president. 
@johnboehner @ericcantor you can't con people...if you don't deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on. the art of the deal 
so china is ordering us to raise the debt limit...how low have we as a nation sunk? 
the gop doesn't waste an opportunity to waste an opportunity. defunding obamacare should be central to any deal. 
every dollar @barackobama spends costs $1.40 with interest borrowed from china on our children and grandchildren's backs. cut cap balance 
@barackobama has sold guns to mexican drug lords while his doj erodes our 2nd amendment rights.

if only @obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening israel's borders then america would be on the path to solvency. 
the art of the deal the best thing you can do is deal from strength, and leverage is the biggest strength you have. cut, cap and balance. 
republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @barackobama in today's debt talks first and foremost cut,cap and balance. 
congress is back.time to cut, cap and balance.there is no revenue problem.the debt limit cannot be raised until obama spending is contained.
